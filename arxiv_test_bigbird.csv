0,"for about 20 years the problem of properties of short - term changes of solar activity has been considered extensively . 
 many investigators studied the short - term periodicities of the various indices of solar activity . 
 several periodicities were detected , but the periodicities about 155 days and from the interval of @xmath3 $ ] days ( @xmath4 $ ] years ) are mentioned most often . 
 first of them was discovered by @xcite in the occurence rate of gamma - ray flares detected by the gamma - ray spectrometer aboard the _ solar maximum mission ( smm ) . 
 this periodicity was confirmed for other solar flares data and for the same time period @xcite . 
 it was also found in proton flares during solar cycles 19 and 20 @xcite , but it was not found in the solar flares data during solar cycles 22 @xcite . 
 _    several autors confirmed above results for the daily sunspot area data . @xcite studied the sunspot data from 18741984 . 
 she found the 155-day periodicity in data records from 31 years . 
 this periodicity is always characteristic for one of the solar hemispheres ( the southern hemisphere for cycles 1215 and the northern hemisphere for cycles 1621 ) . 
 moreover , it is only present during epochs of maximum activity ( in episodes of 13 years ) . 
 similarinvestigationswerecarriedoutby + @xcite . 
 they applied the same power spectrum method as lean , but the daily sunspot area data ( cycles 1221 ) were divided into 10 shorter time series . 
 the periodicities were searched for the frequency interval 57115 nhz ( 100200 days ) and for each of 10 time series . 
 the authors showed that the periodicity between 150160 days is statistically significant during all cycles from 16 to 21 . 
 the considered peaks were remained unaltered after removing the 11-year cycle and applying the power spectrum analysis . 
 @xcite used the wavelet technique for the daily sunspot areas between 1874 and 1993 . 
 they determined the epochs of appearance of this periodicity and concluded that it presents around the maximum activity period in cycles 16 to 21 . 
 moreover , the power of this periodicity started growing at cycle 19 , decreased in cycles 20 and 21 and disappered after cycle 21 . 
 similaranalyseswerepresentedby + @xcite , but for sunspot number , solar wind plasma , interplanetary magnetic field and geomagnetic activity index @xmath5 . 
 during 1964 - 2000 the sunspot number wavelet power of periods less than one year shows a cyclic evolution with the phase of the solar cycle.the 154-day period is prominent and its strenth is stronger around the 1982 - 1984 interval in almost all solar wind parameters . 
 the existence of the 156-day periodicity in sunspot data were confirmed by @xcite . 
 they considered the possible relation between the 475-day ( 1.3-year ) and 156-day periodicities . 
 the 475-day ( 1.3-year ) periodicity was also detected in variations of the interplanetary magnetic field , geomagnetic activity helioseismic data and in the solar wind speed @xcite . 
 @xcite concluded that the region of larger wavelet power shifts from 475-day ( 1.3-year ) period to 620-day ( 1.7-year ) period and then back to 475-day ( 1.3-year ) . 
 the periodicities from the interval @xmath6 $ ] days ( @xmath4 $ ] years ) have been considered from 1968 . 
 @xcite mentioned a 16.3-month ( 490-day ) periodicity in the sunspot numbers and in the geomagnetic data . 
 @xcite analysed the occurrence rate of major flares during solar cycles 19 . 
 they found a 18-month ( 540-day ) periodicity in flare rate of the norhern hemisphere . 
 @xcite confirmed this result for the @xmath7 flare data for solar cycles 20 and 21 and found a peak in the power spectra near 510540 days . 
 @xcite found a 17-month ( 510-day ) periodicity of sunspot groups and their areas from 1969 to 1986 . 
 these authors concluded that the length of this period is variable and the reason of this periodicity is still not understood . 
 @xcite and + @xcite obtained statistically significant peaks of power at around 158 days for daily sunspot data from 1923 - 1933 ( cycle 16 ) . in this paper the problem of the existence of this periodicity for sunspot data from cycle 16 is considered . 
 the daily sunspot areas , the mean sunspot areas per carrington rotation , the monthly sunspot numbers and their fluctuations , which are obtained after removing the 11-year cycle are analysed . in section 2 the properties of the power spectrum methods are described . in section 3 a new approach to the problem of aliases in the power spectrum analysis 
 is presented . in section 4 numerical results of the new method of the diagnosis of an echo - effect for sunspot area data are discussed . in section 5 the problem of the existence of the periodicity of about 155 days during the maximum activity period for sunspot data from the whole solar disk and from each solar hemisphere separately is considered . 
 to find periodicities in a given time series the power spectrum analysis is applied . in this paper 
 two methods are used : the fast fourier transformation algorithm with the hamming window function ( fft ) and the blackman - tukey ( bt ) power spectrum method @xcite . 
 the bt method is used for the diagnosis of the reasons of the existence of peaks , which are obtained by the fft method . 
 the bt method consists in the smoothing of a cosine transform of an autocorrelation function using a 3-point weighting average . 
 such an estimator is consistent and unbiased . 
 moreover , the peaks are uncorrelated and their sum is a variance of a considered time series . the main disadvantage of this method is a weak resolution of the periodogram points , particularly for low frequences . 
 for example , if the autocorrelation function is evaluated for @xmath8 , then the distribution points in the time domain are : @xmath9 thus , it is obvious that this method should not be used for detecting low frequency periodicities with a fairly good resolution . 
 however , because of an application of the autocorrelation function , the bt method can be used to verify a reality of peaks which are computed using a method giving the better resolution ( for example the fft method ) . 
 it is valuable to remember that the power spectrum methods should be applied very carefully . 
 the difficulties in the interpretation of significant peaks could be caused by at least four effects : a sampling of a continuos function , an echo - effect , a contribution of long - term periodicities and a random noise . 
 first effect exists because periodicities , which are shorter than the sampling interval , may mix with longer periodicities . in result , this effect can be reduced by an decrease of the sampling interval between observations . 
 the echo - effect occurs when there is a latent harmonic of frequency @xmath10 in the time series , giving a spectral peak at @xmath10 , and also periodic terms of frequency @xmath11 etc . 
 this may be detected by the autocorrelation function for time series with a large variance . 
 time series often contain long - term periodicities , that influence short - term peaks . 
 they could rise periodogram s peaks at lower frequencies . 
 however , it is also easy to notice the influence of the long - term periodicities on short - term peaks in the graphs of the autocorrelation functions . 
 this effect is observed for the time series of solar activity indexes which are limited by the 11-year cycle .    to find statistically significant periodicities 
 it is reasonable to use the autocorrelation function and the power spectrum method with a high resolution . in the case of a stationary time 
 series they give similar results . 
 moreover , for a stationary time series with the mean zero the fourier transform is equivalent to the cosine transform of an autocorrelation function @xcite . 
 thus , after a comparison of a periodogram with an appropriate autocorrelation function one can detect peaks which are in the graph of the first function and do not exist in the graph of the second function . 
 the reasons of their existence could be explained by the long - term periodicities and the echo - effect . 
 below method enables one to detect these effects .

 the method of the diagnosis of an echo - effect in the power spectrum ( de ) consists in an analysis of a periodogram of a given time series computed using the bt method . 
 the bt method bases on the cosine transform of the autocorrelation function which creates peaks which are in the periodogram , but not in the autocorrelation function . 
 the de method is used for peaks which are computed by the fft method ( with high resolution ) and are statistically significant . 
 the time series of sunspot activity indexes with the spacing interval one rotation or one month contain a markov - type persistence , which means a tendency for the successive values of the time series to remember their antecendent values . 
 thus , i use a confidence level basing on the red noise of markov @xcite for the choice of the significant peaks of the periodogram computed by the fft method . 
 when a time series does not contain the markov - type persistence i apply the fisher test and the kolmogorov - smirnov test at the significance level @xmath12 @xcite to verify a statistically significance of periodograms peaks . the fisher test checks the null hypothesis that the time series is white noise agains the alternative hypothesis that the time series contains an added deterministic periodic component of unspecified frequency . because the fisher test tends to be severe in rejecting peaks as insignificant the kolmogorov - smirnov test is also used . 
 the de method analyses raw estimators of the power spectrum . 
 they are given as follows    @xmath13    for @xmath14 + where @xmath15 for @xmath16 + @xmath17 is the length of the time series @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the mean value . 
 the first term of the estimator @xmath20 is constant . 
 the second term takes two values ( depending on odd or even @xmath21 ) which are not significant because @xmath22 for large m. thus , the third term of ( 1 ) should be analysed . 
 looking for intervals of @xmath23 for which @xmath24 has the same sign and different signs one can find such parts of the function @xmath25 which create the value @xmath20 . 
 let the set of values of the independent variable of the autocorrelation function be called @xmath26 and it can be divided into the sums of disjoint sets : @xmath27 where + @xmath28 + @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 + @xmath32 + @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 
 @xmath39 @xmath40    well , the set @xmath41 contains all integer values of @xmath23 from the interval of @xmath42 for which the autocorrelation function and the cosinus function with the period @xmath43 $ ] are positive . 
 the index @xmath44 indicates successive parts of the cosinus function for which the cosinuses of successive values of @xmath23 have the same sign . 
 however , sometimes the set @xmath41 can be empty . 
 for example , for @xmath45 and @xmath46 the set @xmath47 should contain all @xmath48 $ ] for which @xmath49 and @xmath50 , but for such values of @xmath23 the values of @xmath51 are negative . 
 thus , the set @xmath47 is empty .    . 
 the periodogram values are presented on the left axis . 
 the lower curve illustrates the autocorrelation function of the same time series . 
 the autocorrelation values are shown in the right axis . ] 
 let us take into consideration all sets \{@xmath52 } , \{@xmath53 } and \{@xmath41 } which are not empty . because numberings and power of these sets depend on the form of the autocorrelation function of the given time series , it is impossible to establish them arbitrary . 
 thus , the sets of appropriate indexes of the sets \{@xmath52 } , \{@xmath53 } and \{@xmath41 } are called @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively . for example 
 the set @xmath56 contains all @xmath44 from the set @xmath57 for which the sets @xmath41 are not empty . 
 to separate quantitatively in the estimator @xmath20 the positive contributions which are originated by the cases described by the formula ( 5 ) from the cases which are described by the formula ( 3 ) the following indexes are introduced : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 taking for the empty sets \{@xmath53 } and \{@xmath41 } the indices @xmath65 and @xmath66 equal zero . 
 the index @xmath65 describes a percentage of the contribution of the case when @xmath25 and @xmath51 are positive to the positive part of the third term of the sum ( 1 ) . 
 the index @xmath66 describes a similar contribution , but for the case when the both @xmath25 and @xmath51 are simultaneously negative . 
 thanks to these one can decide which the positive or the negative values of the autocorrelation function have a larger contribution to the positive values of the estimator @xmath20 . 
 when the difference @xmath67 is positive , the statement the @xmath21-th peak really exists can not be rejected . 
 thus , the following formula should be satisfied : @xmath68    because the @xmath21-th peak could exist as a result of the echo - effect , it is necessary to verify the second condition :    @xmath69\in c_m.\ ] ]    . 
 the periodogram values are presented on the left axis . 
 the lower curve illustrates the autocorrelation function of the same time series ( solid line ) . 
 the dotted lines represent two standard errors of the autocorrelation function . 
 the dashed horizontal line shows the zero level . 
 the autocorrelation values are shown in the right axis . ]    to verify the implication ( 8) firstly it is necessary to evaluate the sets @xmath41 for @xmath70 of the values of @xmath23 for which the autocorrelation function and the cosine function with the period @xmath71 $ ] are positive and the sets @xmath72 of values of @xmath23 for which the autocorrelation function and the cosine function with the period @xmath43 $ ] are negative . 
 secondly , a percentage of the contribution of the sum of products of positive values of @xmath25 and @xmath51 to the sum of positive products of the values of @xmath25 and @xmath51 should be evaluated . as a result the indexes @xmath65 for each set 
 @xmath41 where @xmath44 is the index from the set @xmath56 are obtained . 
 thirdly , from all sets @xmath41 such that @xmath70 the set @xmath73 for which the index @xmath65 is the greatest should be chosen .    the implication ( 8) is true when the set @xmath73 includes the considered period @xmath43 $ ] . 
 this means that the greatest contribution of positive values of the autocorrelation function and positive cosines with the period @xmath43 $ ] to the periodogram value @xmath20 is caused by the sum of positive products of @xmath74 for each @xmath75-\frac{m}{2k},[\frac{2m}{k}]+\frac{m}{2k})$ ] .    when the implication ( 8) is false , the peak @xmath20 is mainly created by the sum of positive products of @xmath74 for each @xmath76-\frac{m}{2k},\big [ \frac{2m}{n}\big ] + \frac{m}{2k } \big ) $ ] , where @xmath77 is a multiple or a divisor of @xmath21 . 
 it is necessary to add , that the de method should be applied to the periodograms peaks , which probably exist because of the echo - effect . 
 it enables one to find such parts of the autocorrelation function , which have the significant contribution to the considered peak . 
 the fact , that the conditions ( 7 ) and ( 8) are satisfied , can unambiguously decide about the existence of the considered periodicity in the given time series , but if at least one of them is not satisfied , one can doubt about the existence of the considered periodicity . 
 thus , in such cases the sentence the peak can not be treated as true should be used .    using the de method 
 it is necessary to remember about the power of the set @xmath78 . 
 if @xmath79 is too large , errors of an autocorrelation function estimation appear . 
 they are caused by the finite length of the given time series and as a result additional peaks of the periodogram occur . if @xmath79 is too small , there are less peaks because of a low resolution of the periodogram . in applications 
 @xmath80 is used . in order to evaluate the value 
 @xmath79 the fft method is used . 
 the periodograms computed by the bt and the fft method are compared . 
 the conformity of them enables one to obtain the value @xmath79 .    . 
 the fft periodogram values are presented on the left axis . 
 the lower curve illustrates the bt periodogram of the same time series ( solid line and large black circles ) . 
 the bt periodogram values are shown in the right axis . ] 
 in this paper the sunspot activity data ( august 1923 - october 1933 ) provided by the greenwich photoheliographic results ( gpr ) are analysed . 
 firstly , i consider the monthly sunspot number data . to eliminate the 11-year trend from these data , 
 the consecutively smoothed monthly sunspot number @xmath81 is subtracted from the monthly sunspot number @xmath82 where the consecutive mean @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 the values @xmath83 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 are calculated using additional data from last six months of cycle 15 and first six months of cycle 17 .    because of the north - south asymmetry of various solar indices @xcite , the sunspot activity is considered for each solar hemisphere separately . 
 analogously to the monthly sunspot numbers , the time series of sunspot areas in the northern and southern hemispheres with the spacing interval @xmath87 rotation are denoted . in order to find periodicities , 
 the following time series are used : + @xmath88 
 + @xmath89 
 + @xmath90     + in the lower part of figure [ f1 ] the autocorrelation function of the time series for the northern hemisphere @xmath88 is shown . 
 it is easy to notice that the prominent peak falls at 17 rotations interval ( 459 days ) and @xmath25 for @xmath91 $ ] rotations ( [ 81 , 162 ] days ) are significantly negative . 
 the periodogram of the time series @xmath88 ( see the upper curve in figures [ f1 ] ) does not show the significant peaks at @xmath92 rotations ( 135 , 162 days ) , but there is the significant peak at @xmath93 ( 243 days ) . 
 the peaks at @xmath94 are close to the peaks of the autocorrelation function . 
 thus , the result obtained for the periodicity at about @xmath0 days are contradict to the results obtained for the time series of daily sunspot areas @xcite .    for the southern hemisphere ( the lower curve in figure [ f2 ] ) @xmath25 for @xmath95 $ ] rotations ( [ 54 , 189 ] days ) is not positive except @xmath96 ( 135 days ) for which @xmath97 is not statistically significant . 
 the upper curve in figures [ f2 ] presents the periodogram of the time series @xmath89 . 
 this time series does not contain a markov - type persistence . 
 moreover , the kolmogorov - smirnov test and the fisher test do not reject a null hypothesis that the time series is a white noise only . 
 this means that the time series do not contain an added deterministic periodic component of unspecified frequency . 
 the autocorrelation function of the time series @xmath90 ( the lower curve in figure [ f3 ] ) has only one statistically significant peak for @xmath98 months ( 480 days ) and negative values for @xmath99 $ ] months ( [ 90 , 390 ] days ) . 
 however , the periodogram of this time series ( the upper curve in figure [ f3 ] ) has two significant peaks the first at 15.2 and the second at 5.3 months ( 456 , 159 days ) . 
 thus , the periodogram contains the significant peak , although the autocorrelation function has the negative value at @xmath100 months .    to explain 
 these problems two following time series of daily sunspot areas are considered : + @xmath101 
 + @xmath102     + where @xmath103    the values @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 are calculated using additional daily data from the solar cycles 15 and 17 .     and the cosine function for @xmath45 ( the period at about 154 days ) . 
 the horizontal line ( dotted line ) shows the zero level . 
 the vertical dotted lines evaluate the intervals where the sets @xmath107 ( for @xmath108 ) are searched . 
 the percentage values show the index @xmath65 for each @xmath41 for the time series @xmath102 ( in parentheses for the time series @xmath101 ) . in the right bottom corner 
 the values of @xmath65 for the time series @xmath102 , for @xmath109 are written . ] 
 ( the 500-day period ) ]    the comparison of the functions @xmath25 of the time series @xmath101 ( the lower curve in figure [ f4 ] ) and @xmath102 ( the lower curve in figure [ f5 ] ) suggests that the positive values of the function @xmath110 of the time series @xmath101 in the interval of @xmath111 $ ] days could be caused by the 11-year cycle . 
 this effect is not visible in the case of periodograms of the both time series computed using the fft method ( see the upper curves in figures [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] ) or the bt method ( see the lower curve in figure [ f6 ] ) . moreover , the periodogram of the time series @xmath102 has the significant values at @xmath112 days , but the autocorrelation function is negative at these points . 
 @xcite showed that the lomb - scargle periodograms for the both time series ( see @xcite , figures 7 a - c ) have a peak at 158.8 days which stands over the fap level by a significant amount . using the de method the above discrepancies are obvious . to establish the @xmath79 value the periodograms computed by the fft and 
 the bt methods are shown in figure [ f6 ] ( the upper and the lower curve respectively ) . 
 for @xmath46 and for periods less than 166 days there is a good comformity of the both periodograms ( but for periods greater than 166 days the points of the bt periodogram are not linked because the bt periodogram has much worse resolution than the fft periodogram ( no one know how to do it ) ) . for @xmath46 and @xmath113 
 the value of @xmath21 is 13 ( @xmath71=153 $ ] ) . 
 the inequality ( 7 ) is satisfied because @xmath114 . 
 this means that the value of @xmath115 is mainly created by positive values of the autocorrelation function . 
 the implication ( 8) needs an evaluation of the greatest value of the index @xmath65 where @xmath70 , but the solar data contain the most prominent period for @xmath116 days because of the solar rotation . 
 thus , although @xmath117 for each @xmath118 , all sets @xmath41 ( see ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ) without the set @xmath119 ( see ( 4 ) ) , which contains @xmath120 $ ] , are considered . this situation is presented in figure [ f7 ] . in this figure 
 two curves @xmath121 and @xmath122 are plotted . 
 the vertical dotted lines evaluate the intervals where the sets @xmath107 ( for @xmath123 ) are searched . for such @xmath41 two numbers 
 are written : in parentheses the value of @xmath65 for the time series @xmath101 and above it the value of @xmath65 for the time series @xmath102 . to make this figure clear the curves are plotted for the set @xmath124 only . 
 ( in the right bottom corner information about the values of @xmath65 for the time series @xmath102 , for @xmath109 are written . ) 
 the implication ( 8) is not true , because @xmath125 for @xmath126 . 
 therefore , @xmath43=153\notin c_6=[423,500]$ ] . 
 moreover , the autocorrelation function for @xmath127 $ ] is negative and the set @xmath128 is empty . 
 thus , @xmath129 . on the basis of these information one can state , that the periodogram peak at @xmath130 days of the time series @xmath102 exists because of positive @xmath25 , but for @xmath23 from the intervals which do not contain this period . 
 looking at the values of @xmath65 of the time series @xmath101 , one can notice that they decrease when @xmath23 increases until @xmath131 . 
 this indicates , that when @xmath23 increases , the contribution of the 11-year cycle to the peaks of the periodogram decreases . 
 an increase of the value of @xmath65 is for @xmath132 for the both time series , although the contribution of the 11-year cycle for the time series @xmath101 is insignificant . 
 thus , this part of the autocorrelation function ( @xmath133 for the time series @xmath102 ) influences the @xmath21-th peak of the periodogram . 
 this suggests that the periodicity at about 155 days is a harmonic of the periodicity from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] days . 
 ( solid line ) and consecutively smoothed sunspot areas of the one rotation time interval @xmath134 ( dotted line ) . 
 both indexes are presented on the left axis . 
 the lower curve illustrates fluctuations of the sunspot areas @xmath135 . 
 the dotted and dashed horizontal lines represent levels zero and @xmath136 respectively . 
 the fluctuations are shown on the right axis . ] 
 the described reasoning can be carried out for other values of the periodogram . 
 for example , the condition ( 8) is not satisfied for @xmath137 ( 250 , 222 , 200 days ) . 
 moreover , the autocorrelation function at these points is negative . 
 these suggest that there are not a true periodicity in the interval of [ 200 , 250 ] days . 
 it is difficult to decide about the existence of the periodicities for @xmath138 ( 333 days ) and @xmath139 ( 286 days ) on the basis of above analysis . the implication ( 8) is not satisfied for @xmath139 and the condition ( 7 ) is not satisfied for @xmath138 , although the function @xmath25 of the time series @xmath102 is significantly positive for @xmath140 . 
 the conditions ( 7 ) and ( 8) are satisfied for @xmath141 ( figure [ f8 ] ) and @xmath142 . therefore , it is possible to exist the periodicity from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] days . 
 similar results were also obtained by @xcite for daily sunspot numbers and daily sunspot areas . 
 she considered the means of three periodograms of these indexes for data from @xmath143 years and found statistically significant peaks from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] ( see @xcite , figure 2 ) . 
 @xcite studied sunspot areas from 1876 - 1999 and sunspot numbers from 1749 - 2001 with the help of the wavelet transform . 
 they pointed out that the 154 - 158-day period could be the third harmonic of the 1.3-year ( 475-day ) period . 
 moreover , the both periods fluctuate considerably with time , being stronger during stronger sunspot cycles . 
 therefore , the wavelet analysis suggests a common origin of the both periodicities . this conclusion confirms the de method result which indicates that the periodogram peak at @xmath144 days is an alias of the periodicity from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] 
 in order to verify the existence of the periodicity at about 155 days i consider the following time series : + @xmath145     + @xmath146 
 + @xmath147 
 + the value @xmath134 is calculated analogously to @xmath83 ( see sect . 
 the values @xmath148 and @xmath149 are evaluated from the formula ( 9 ) . in the upper part of figure [ f9 ] the time series of sunspot areas @xmath150 of the one rotation time interval from the whole solar disk and the time series of consecutively smoothed sunspot areas @xmath151 
 are showed . in the lower part of figure [ f9 ] 
 the time series of sunspot area fluctuations @xmath145 is presented . 
 on the basis of these data the maximum activity period of cycle 16 is evaluated . 
 it is an interval between two strongest fluctuations e.a . 
 @xmath152 $ ] rotations . 
 the length of the time interval @xmath153 is 54 rotations . 
 if the about @xmath0-day ( 6 solar rotations ) periodicity existed in this time interval and it was characteristic for strong fluctuations from this time interval , 10 local maxima in the set of @xmath154 would be seen . 
 then it should be necessary to find such a value of p for which @xmath155 for @xmath156 and the number of the local maxima of these values is 10 . 
 as it can be seen in the lower part of figure [ f9 ] this is for the case of @xmath157 ( in this figure the dashed horizontal line is the level of @xmath158 ) . 
 figure [ f10 ] presents nine time distances among the successive fluctuation local maxima and the horizontal line represents the 6-rotation periodicity . 
 it is immediately apparent that the dispersion of these points is 10 and it is difficult to find even few points which oscillate around the value of 6 . 
 such an analysis was carried out for smaller and larger @xmath136 and the results were similar . 
 therefore , the fact , that the about @xmath0-day periodicity exists in the time series of sunspot area fluctuations during the maximum activity period is questionable .    . 
 the horizontal line represents the 6-rotation ( 162-day ) period . ]    ]    ]    to verify again the existence of the about @xmath0-day periodicity during the maximum activity period in each solar hemisphere separately , the time series @xmath88 and @xmath89 were also cut down to the maximum activity period ( january 1925december 1930 ) . 
 the comparison of the autocorrelation functions of these time series with the appriopriate autocorrelation functions of the time series @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which are computed for the whole 11-year cycle ( the lower curves of figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) , indicates that there are not significant differences between them especially for @xmath23=5 and 6 rotations ( 135 and 162 days ) ) . 
 this conclusion is confirmed by the analysis of the time series @xmath146 for the maximum activity period . 
 the autocorrelation function ( the lower curve of figure [ f11 ] ) is negative for the interval of [ 57 , 173 ] days , but the resolution of the periodogram is too low to find the significant peak at @xmath159 days . 
 the autocorrelation function gives the same result as for daily sunspot area fluctuations from the whole solar disk ( @xmath160 ) ( see also the lower curve of figures [ f5 ] ) . in the case of 
 the time series @xmath89 @xmath161 is zero for the fluctuations from the whole solar cycle and it is almost zero ( @xmath162 ) for the fluctuations from the maximum activity period . 
 the value @xmath163 is negative . 
 similarly to the case of the northern hemisphere the autocorrelation function and the periodogram of southern hemisphere daily sunspot area fluctuations from the maximum activity period @xmath147 are computed ( see figure [ f12 ] ) . 
 the autocorrelation function has the statistically significant positive peak in the interval of [ 155 , 165 ] days , but the periodogram has too low resolution to decide about the possible periodicities . 
 the correlative analysis indicates that there are positive fluctuations with time distances about @xmath0 days in the maximum activity period . 
 the results of the analyses of the time series of sunspot area fluctuations from the maximum activity period are contradict with the conclusions of @xcite . 
 she uses the power spectrum analysis only . 
 the periodogram of daily sunspot fluctuations contains peaks , which could be harmonics or subharmonics of the true periodicities . 
 they could be treated as real periodicities . 
 this effect is not visible for sunspot data of the one rotation time interval , but averaging could lose true periodicities . 
 this is observed for data from the southern hemisphere . 
 there is the about @xmath0-day peak in the autocorrelation function of daily fluctuations , but the correlation for data of the one rotation interval is almost zero or negative at the points @xmath164 and 6 rotations . 
 thus , it is reasonable to research both time series together using the correlative and the power spectrum analyses . 
 the following results are obtained :    1 . 
 a new method of the detection of statistically significant peaks of the periodograms enables one to identify aliases in the periodogram . 
 2 .   two effects cause the existence of the peak of the periodogram of the time series of sunspot area fluctuations at about @xmath0 days : the first is caused by the 27-day periodicity , which probably creates the 162-day periodicity ( it is a subharmonic frequency of the 27-day periodicity ) and the second is caused by statistically significant positive values of the autocorrelation function from the intervals of @xmath165 $ ] and @xmath166 $ ] days . 
 the existence of the periodicity of about @xmath0 days of the time series of sunspot area fluctuations and sunspot area fluctuations from the northern hemisphere during the maximum activity period is questionable . 
 the autocorrelation analysis of the time series of sunspot area fluctuations from the southern hemisphere indicates that the periodicity of about 155 days exists during the maximum activity period . 
 i appreciate valuable comments from professor j. jakimiec .","the short - term periodicities of the daily sunspot area fluctuations from august 1923 to october 1933 are discussed . for these data 
 the correlative analysis indicates negative correlation for the periodicity of about @xmath0 days , but the power spectrum analysis indicates a statistically significant peak in this time interval .

1,"it is believed that the direct detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) will bring the era of gravitational wave astronomy . 
 the interferometer detectors are now under operation and awaiting the first signal of gws  @xcite . 
 it is also known that pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) can be used as a detector for gws @xcite . 
 these detectors are used to search for very low frequency ( @xmath0 ) gravitational waves , where the lower limit of the observable frequencies is determined by the inverse of total observation time @xmath1 . 
 indeed , the total observation time has a crucial role in ptas , because ptas are most sensitive near the lower edge of observable frequencies @xcite . taking into account its sensitivity , 
 the first direct detection of the gravitational waves might be achieved by ptas . 
 the main target of ptas is the stochastic gravitational wave background ( sgwb ) generated by a large number of unresolved sources with the astrophysical origin or the cosmological origin in the early universe . 
 the promising sources are super massive black hole binaries  @xcite , cosmic ( super)string  @xcite , and inflation  @xcite . 
 previous studies have assumed that the sgwb is isotropic and unpolarized  @xcite . 
 these assumptions are reasonable for the primary detection of the sgwb , but the deviation from the isotropy and the polarizations should have rich information of sources of gravitational waves . 
 recently , the cross - correlation formalism has been generalized to deal with anisotropy in the sgwb @xcite . 
 result of this work enables us to consider arbitrary levels of anisotropy , and a bayesian approach was performed by using this formalism @xcite . on the other hand , for the anisotropy of the sgwb , the cross - correlation formalism has been also developed in the case of interferometer detectors  @xcite . 
 as to the polarization , there are works including the ones motivated by the modified gravity  @xcite 
 . we can envisage supermassive black hole binaries emit circularly polarized sgwb due to the chern - simons term  @xcite . 
 there may also exist cosmological sgwb with circular polarization in the presence of parity violating term in gravity sector  @xcite .    in this paper 
 , we investigate the detectability of circular polarization in the sgwb by ptas . 
 we characterize sgwb by the so called stokes @xmath2 parameter  @xcite and calculate generalized overlap reduction functions ( orfs ) so that we can probe the circular polarization of the sgwb . 
 we also discuss a method to separate the intensity ( @xmath3 mode ) and circular polarization ( @xmath2 mode ) of the sgwb . 
 the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : 
 stokes parameters for a plane gravitational wave ] , we introduce the stokes parameters for monochromatic plane gravitational waves , and clarify the physical meaning of the stokes parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in section [ sec : formulation ] , we formulate the cross - correlation formalism for anisotropic circularly polarized sgwb with ptas . 
 the basic framework is essentially a combination of the formalism of @xcite , and the polarization decomposition formula of the sgwb derived in @xcite . in section [ sec : the generalized overlap reduction function for circular polarization ] , we calculate the generalized orfs for the @xmath2 mode . 
 the results for @xmath3 mode are consistent with the previous work  @xcite . in section [ sec : separation method ] , we give a method for separation between the @xmath3 mode and @xmath2 mode of the sgwb . 
 the final section is devoted to the conclusion . in appendixes , we present analytic results for the generalized overlap reduction functions . in this paper 
 , we will use the gravitational units @xmath4 . 
 let us consider the stokes parameters for plane waves traveling in the direction @xmath5 , which can be described by @xmath6 \ 
 , \\ & & h_{xy}(t , z)=h_{yx}(t , z)={\rm re}[b_{\times}\mathrm{e}^{-iw(t - z ) } ] \ .\end{aligned}\ ] ] for an idealized monochromatic plane wave , complex amplitudes @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constants . 
 polarization of the plane gws is characterized by the tensor , ( see @xcite and also electromagnetic case @xcite ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 take @xmath11 . 
 any @xmath12 hermitian matrix can be expanded by the pauli and the unit matrices with real coefficients . 
 hence , the @xmath13 hermitian matrix @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 by analogy with electromagnetic cases , @xmath17 and @xmath2 are called stokes parameters . comparing with , we can read off the stokes parameters as @xmath18= b_{+}^{\ast}b_{\times}+ b_{\times}^{\ast}b_{+},\\ v&=&-2{\rm i m } [ b_{+}^{\ast}b_{\times}]=i ( b_{+}^{\ast}b_{\times}- b_{\times}^{\ast}b_{+}).\label{stv}\end{aligned}\ ] ] apparently , the real parameter @xmath3 is the intensity of gws . in order to reveal the physical meaning of the real parameter @xmath2 , we define the circular polarization bases @xcite @xmath19 from the relation @xmath20 we see @xmath21 
 thus , we can rewrite the stokes parameters - as @xmath22 from the above expression , we see that the real parameter @xmath2 characterizes the asymmetry of circular polarization amplitudes . 
 the other parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 have additional information about linear polarizations by analogy with the electromagnetic cases . 
 alternatively , we can also define the tensor @xmath25 in circular polarization bases @xmath26 where @xmath27 . 
 note that the stokes parameters satisfy a relation @xmath28    next , we consider the transformation of the stokes parameters under rotations around the @xmath5 axis . the rotation around the @xmath5 axis is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angle of the rotation . 
 the gws traveling in the direction @xmath5 @xmath31 transform as @xmath32 where we took the transverse traceless gauge @xmath33 after a short calculation , we obtain @xmath34 using and , the four stokes parameters ( [ sti])-([stv ] ) transform as @xmath35 as you can see , the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 depend on the rotation angle @xmath30 . 
 this reflects the fact that @xmath23 and @xmath24 parameters characterize linear polarizations . 
 note that this transformation is similar to the transformation of electromagnetic case except for the angle @xmath36 and can be rewritten as @xmath37 
 in this section , we study anisotropic distribution of sgwb and focus on the detectability of circular polarizations with pulsar timing arrays . 
 we combine the analysis of @xcite and that of @xcite . in sec.[subsec : the spectral ] , we derive the power spectral density for anisotropic circularly polarized sgwb @xmath38 . 
 then we also derive the dimensionless density parameter @xmath39 which is expressed by the frequency spectrum of intensity @xmath40  @xcite . in sec.[subsec : the signal ] , we extend the generalized orfs to cases with circular polarizations characterized by the parameter @xmath2 . for simplicity , 
 we consider specific anisotropic patterns with @xmath41 expressed by the spherical harmonics @xmath42 .      in the transverse traceless gauge , metric perturbations @xmath43 with a given propagation direction @xmath44 
 can be expanded as @xcite @xmath45 where the fourier amplitude satisfies @xmath46 as a consequence of the reality of @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the frequency of the gws , @xmath49 are spatial indices , @xmath50 label polarizations . 
 note that the fourier amplitude @xmath51 satisfies the relation @xmath52 where @xmath53 was defined by . 
 the polarized tensors @xmath54 are defined by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are unit orthogonal vectors perpendicular to @xmath58 . 
 the polarization tensors satisfy @xmath59 with polar coordinates , the direction @xmath44 can be represented by @xmath60 and the polarization basis vectors read @xmath61    we assume the fourier amplitudes @xmath62 are random variables , which is stationary and gaussian . 
 however , they are not isotropic and unpolarized . 
 the ensemble average of fourier amplitudes can be written as @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 here , the bracket @xmath65 represents an ensemble average , and @xmath66 is the dirac delta function on the two - sphere . 
 the gw power spectral density @xmath38 is a hermitian matrix , and satisfies @xmath67 because of the relation @xmath46 . 
 therefore , we have the relations @xmath68 note that the stokes parameters are not exactly the same as the expression of , but they have the relation and characterize the same polarization . 
 we further assume that the sgwbs satisfy @xmath69 we also assume the directional dependence of the sgwb is frequency independent @xcite . 
 this implies the gw power spectral density is factorized into two parts , one of which depends on the direction while the other depends on the frequency . 
 because of the transformations - , the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 have spin 0 and the parameters @xmath70 have spin @xmath71  @xcite . to analyze the sgwb on the sky , it is convenient to expand the stokes parameters by spherical harmonics @xmath72 
 . however , since @xmath70 parameters have spin @xmath71 , they have to be expanded by the spin - weighted harmonics @xmath73 @xcite . 
 thus , we obtain @xmath74 in this paper , we study specific anisotropic patterns with @xmath41 for simplicity . 
 therefore , we can neglect @xmath23 and @xmath24 from now on . 
 thus , the gw power spectral density becomes @xmath75 where @xmath76 so , we focus on the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in what follows , we will use the following shorthand notation @xmath77    next , we consider the dimensionless density parameter  @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the critical density , @xmath80 is the present value of the hubble parameter , @xmath81 is the energy density of gravitational waves , and @xmath82 is the energy density in the frequency range @xmath48 to @xmath83 . 
 the bracket @xmath65 represents the ensemble average . 
 however , actually , we take a spatial average over the wave lengths @xmath84 of gws or a temporal average over the periods @xmath85 of gws . here 
 , we assumed the ergodicity , namely , the ensemble average can be replaced by the temporal average . 
 using , , , as well as @xmath46 and @xmath86 , we get @xmath87 then we define @xmath88 hence , the dimensionless quantity @xmath39 in is given by @xmath89 where the spherical harmonics are orthogonal and normalized as @xmath90 using @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath92 without loss of generality , we normalize the monopole moment as @xmath93 so , becomes @xmath94      the time of arrival of radio pulses from the pulsar is affected by gws . 
 consider a pulsar with frequency @xmath95 located in the direction @xmath96 . to detect the sgwb , 
 let us consider the redshift of the pulse from a pulsar @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a frequency detected at the earth and @xmath96 is the direction to the pulsar . 
 the unit vector @xmath44 represents the direction of propagation of gravitational plane waves . 
 we also defined the difference between the metric perturbations at the pulsar @xmath99 and at the earth @xmath100 as @xmath101 the gravitational plane waves at each point is defined as @xmath102 for the sgwb , the redshift have to be integrated over the direction of propagation of the gravitational waves @xmath44 : @xmath103 we choose a coordinate system @xmath104 and assume that the amplitudes of the metric perturbation at the pulsar and the earth are the same . 
 then becomes @xmath105 and therefore , reads @xmath106 where we have defined the pattern functions for pulsars @xmath107 note that our convention for the fourier transformation is @xmath108 therefore , the fourier transformation of can be written as @xmath109    in the actual signals from a pulsar , there exist noises . 
 hence , we need to use the correlation analysis . 
 we consider the signals from two pulsars @xmath110 where @xmath111 labels the pulsar . here 
 , @xmath112 denotes the signal from the pulsar and @xmath113 denotes the noise intrinsic to the measurement . 
 we assume the noises are stationary , gaussian and are not correlated between the two pulsars . 
 to correlate the signals of two measurements , we define @xmath114 where @xmath1 is the total observation time and @xmath115 is a real filter function which should be optimal to maximize signal - to - noise ratio . in the case of interferometer 
 , the optimal filter function falls to zero for large @xmath116 compered to the travel time of the light between the detecters . 
 since the signals of two detectors are expected to correlate due to the same effect of the gravitational waves , the optimal filter function should behave this way . 
 then , typically one of the detectors is very close to the other compared to the total observation time @xmath1 . 
 therefore , the total observation time @xmath1 can be extended to @xmath117 @xcite . 
 in contrast , in the case of pta , it is invalid that @xmath1 is very large compered to the travel time of the light between the pulsars . 
 nevertheless , we can assume that one of the two @xmath1 can be expanded to @xmath117 , because in situations @xmath118 and @xmath119 it is known that we can ignore the effect of the distance @xmath120 of pulsars . 
 in this case , it is clear that any locations of the pulsars are optimal and optimal filter function should behave like as the interferometer case @xcite .    using these assumptions @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we can rewrite as @xmath121 where @xmath122 note that @xmath123 satisfies @xmath124 , because @xmath125 is real . 
 moreover , to deal with the unphysical region @xmath126 we require @xmath127 . 
 thus , @xmath123 becomes real . 
 taking the ensemble average , using @xmath128 , @xmath118 , and assuming the noises in the two measurements are not correlated , we get @xmath129\ , \label{s2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath130 the functions @xmath131 and @xmath132 are called the generalized orfs , which describe the angular sensitivity of the pulsars for the sgwb . note that , as we already mentioned , we consider the cases of @xmath41 for simplicity 
 . then we have assumed @xmath118 and @xmath119 , this assumption implies that approximately becomes @xmath133 due to the rapid oscillation of the phase factor . 
 therefore , the distance @xmath120 of the pulsars does not appear in the generalized orfs , and hence the generalized orfs do not depend on the frequency .    as you can see from , 
 the correlation of the two measurements involve both the total intensity and the circular polarization . 
 however , the degeneracy can be disentangled by using separation method , which will be discussed in the section [ sec : separation method ] . 
 in this section , we consider the generalized orfs for circular polarizations : @xmath134 where we defined @xmath135 in the above , we have used and the fact that the generalized orfs do not depend on frequency . for computation of the generalized orfs for circular polarizations , 
 it is convenient to use the computational frame @xcite defined by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the angular separation between the two pulsars . using - , , and 
 , one can easily show that @xmath138 we therefore get @xmath139 the explicit form of the spherical harmonics reads @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the normalization factor . 
 the associated legendre functions are given by @xmath142 and @xmath143 with the legendre functions @xmath144\ .\label{pl}\end{aligned}\ ] ] using the spherical harmonics , becomes @xmath145 where we have used the fact that the function of @xmath146 is odd parity in the case of @xmath147 and is even parity in the case of @xmath148 . 
 note that the generalized orfs for circular polarizations are real functions . in the case of @xmath149 and/or @xmath150 , 
 the integrand in vanishes . 
 therefore , we can not detect circular polarizations for these cases . 
 this fact for @xmath151 implies that we do not need to consider auto - correlation for a single pulsar . 
 this is the reason why we neglected auto - correlation term in .    integrating , 
 we get the following form for @xmath152 : @xmath153 for @xmath154 , we have obtained @xmath155 \ , \\ \gamma^{v}_{1 - 1}&=&\gamma^{v}_{11 } \ , \end{aligned}\ ] ] recall that @xmath156 . 
 the derivation of this formula for @xmath154 can be found in appendix [ sec : angular integral of the generalized overlap reduction function for dipole circular polarization ] .    for @xmath157 , we derived the following : @xmath158\ , \\ \gamma^{v}_{2 - 1}&=&\gamma^{v}_{21}\ , \\ 
 \gamma^{v}_{22}&=&-\frac{\sqrt{30\pi}}{6}(1-\cos\xi)\left[2-\cos\xi+6\left(\frac{1-\cos\xi}{1+\cos\xi}\right)\log\left(\sin\frac{\xi}{2}\right)\right]\ , \\ \gamma^{v}_{2 - 2}&=&-\gamma^{v}_{22}\ , \end{aligned}\ ] ] for @xmath159 , the results are @xmath160\ , \\ \gamma^{v}_{3 - 1}&=&\gamma^{v}_{31}\ , \\ \gamma^{v}_{32}&=&\frac{\sqrt{210\pi}}{24}(1-\cos\xi)\left[8 - 5\cos\xi-\cos^2\xi+24\left(\frac{1-\cos\xi}{1+\cos\xi}\right)\log\left(\sin\frac{\xi}{2}\right)\right]\ , \\ \gamma^{v}_{3 - 2}&=&-\gamma^{v}_{3 - 2}\ , \\ \gamma^{v}_{33}&=&-\frac{\sqrt{35\pi}}{16}\sin\xi\left(\frac{1-\cos\xi}{1+\cos\xi}\right)\left[11 - 6\cos\xi-\cos^2\xi+32\left(\frac{1-\cos\xi}{1+\cos\xi}\right)\log\left(\sin\frac{\xi}{2}\right)\right]\ , \\ \gamma^{v}_{3 - 3}&=&\gamma^{v}_{33}\ .\end{aligned}\ ] ] in fig . 
 [ gv ] , we plotted these generalized orfs as a function of the angular separation between the two pulsars @xmath137 . 
 it is apparent that considering the @xmath2 mode does not make sense when we only consider the isotropic ( @xmath152 ) orf . on the other hand , 
 when we consider anisotropic ( @xmath161 ) orfs , it is worth taking into account polarizations . 
 the polarizations of the sgwb would give us rich information both of super massive black hole binaries and of inflation in the early universe .

 in this section , we separate the @xmath3 mode and @xmath2 mode of the sgwb with correlation analysis @xcite . to this aim ,

 note that , to do this separation , we must know a priori the coefficients @xmath203 and @xmath204 . 
 if we do not assume , the generalized orfs depend on the frequency . in this case 
 , it seems difficult to calculate these coefficients . 
 we next consider the case that @xmath3 mode and/or @xmath2 mode dominant in two or more @xmath205 . in this case , if we have a priori knowledge of the values of @xmath206 in each of @xmath205 for coefficients 
 @xmath203 and @xmath204 , we can separate @xmath3 mode and @xmath2 mode . for example , assume that @xmath3 mode is dominated by @xmath207 , while @xmath2 mode is dominated by @xmath208 , then and become @xmath209\ , \label{3c12}\\ & & c_{34}(f)=\left[c^{i}_{00}i(f)\left(\gamma_{00,34}^{i}+\frac{c^{i}_{11}}{c^{i}_{00}}\gamma_{11,34}^{i}\right)+c_{11}^{v}v(f)\gamma_{11,34}^{v}\right]\ .\label{3c34}\end{aligned}\ ] ] thus , we can separate @xmath3 mode and @xmath2 mode by using linear combinations @xmath210\ , \\

 [ cg ] we show some compiled orfs @xmath213 ( left panels ) and @xmath214 ( right panels ) as a function of the two angular separations @xmath137 and @xmath215 for two pulsar pairs , respectively . 
 we used the expressions of @xmath2 mode and @xmath3 mode ( see appendix [ sec : the generalized overlap reduction function for intensity ] ) , and we assumed @xmath216 for simplicity . in fig .

 we have studied the detectability of the stochastic gravitational waves with ptas . in most of the previous works , 
 the isotropy of sgwb has been assumed for the analysis . 
 recently , however , a stochastic gravitational wave background with anisotropy have been considered . 
 the information of the anisotropic pattern of the distribution should contain important information of the sources such as supermassive black hole binaries and the sources in the early universe . 
 it is also intriguing to take into account the polarization of sgwb in the pta analysis . 
 therefore , we extended the correlation analysis to circularly polarized sgwb and calculated generalized overlap reduction functions for them . 
 it turned out that the circular polarization can not be detected for an isotropic background . 
 however , when the distribution has anisotropy , we have shown that there is a chance to observe circular polarizations in the sgwb . 
 we also discussed how to separate polarized modes from unpolarized modes of gravitational waves . 
 if we have a priori knowledge of the abundance ratio for each mode in each of @xmath205 , we can separate @xmath3 mode and @xmath2 mode in general . 
 this would be possible if we start from fundamental theory and calculate the spectrum of sgwb . 
 in particular , in the case that the signal of lowest @xmath222 is dominant , we performed the separation of @xmath3 mode and @xmath2 mode explicitly .

 in this appendix , we perform angular integration of the generalized orf for dipole ( @xmath154 ) circular polarization ( see @xcite ) : @xmath223 where we have defined @xmath224 . 
 it is obvious that in the case of @xmath225 , integrand of the generalized orf is zero , because of @xmath226 , then we obtain @xmath227 then , using - , we calculate @xmath228 and we find @xmath229    therefore we only have to consider the dipole generalized orf in the case of @xmath154 , @xmath230 : @xmath231 where @xmath232 first , to calculate @xmath233 , we use contour integral in the complex plane . defining @xmath234 and substituting @xmath235 into , we can rewrite @xmath233 as @xmath236 } \ , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath237 denotes a unit circle . 
 we can factorize the denominator of the integrand and get @xmath238 where @xmath239 hereafter , the upper sign applies when @xmath240 and the lower one applies when @xmath241 . 
 note that we only consider the region @xmath242 , so we have used the relation @xmath243 in above expression . in the region 
 @xmath244 , @xmath245 is inside the unit circle @xmath237 except for @xmath246 and @xmath247 is outside the unit circle @xmath237 . 
 now , we can perform the integral using the residue theorem @xmath248 where @xmath249 the residues inside the unit circle @xmath237 can be evaluated as @xmath250\right\ }             = \frac{i(z_{+}+z_{-})}{2\sqrt{1-x^2}\sin\xi } \ , \end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath251 thus , we obtain @xmath252 next , we consider @xmath253 defined in

 in this appendix , we show orfs for the intensity @xcite . 
 the following form for @xmath152 was derived in @xcite , and our expressions are identical to their expressions : @xmath271\ , \end{aligned}\ ] ] for , @xmath154 , we calculated as @xmath272\ , \\ \gamma^{i}_{11}&=&\frac{\sqrt{6\pi}}{12}\sin\xi\left[1 + 3(1-\cos\xi)\left\{1+\frac{4}{1+\cos\xi}\log\left(\sin\frac{\xi}{2}\right)\right\}\right]\ , \\ \gamma^{i}_{1 - 1}&=&-\gamma^{i}_{11}\ , \end{aligned}\ ] ] for @xmath157 , we obtain @xmath273\ , \\ \gamma^{i}_{21}&=&-\frac{\sqrt{30\pi}}{60}\sin\xi\left[21 - 15\cos\xi-5\cos^2\xi+60\left(\frac{1-\cos\xi}{1+\cos\xi}\right)\log\left(\sin\frac{\xi}{2}\right)\right]\ , \\ \gamma^{i}_{2 - 1}&=&-\gamma^{i}_{2 - 1}\ , \\ \gamma^{i}_{22}&=&\frac{\sqrt{30\pi}}{24}(1-\cos\xi)\left[9 - 4\cos\xi-\cos^2\xi+24\left(\frac{1-\cos\xi}{1+\cos\xi}\right)\log\left(\sin\frac{\xi}{2}\right)\right]\ , \\ \gamma^{i}_{2 - 2}&=&\gamma^{i}_{22}\ , 
 \end{aligned}\ ] ] for @xmath159 , it is straightforward to reach the following @xmath274\ , \\ \gamma^{i}_{31}&=&\frac{\sqrt{21\pi}}{48}\sin\xi(1-\cos\xi)\left[34 + 15\cos\xi+5\cos^2\xi+\frac{96}{1+\cos\xi}\log\left(\sin\frac{\xi}{2}\right)\right]\ , \\ \gamma^{i}_{3 - 1}&=&-\gamma^{i}_{31}\ , \\ \gamma^{i}_{32}&=&-\frac{\sqrt{210\pi}}{48}(1-\cos\xi)\left[17 - 9\cos\xi-3\cos^2\xi-\cos^3\xi+48\left(\frac{1-\cos\xi}{1+\cos\xi}\right)\log\left(\sin\frac{\xi}{2}\right)\right]\ , \\ \gamma^{i}_{3 - 2}&=&\gamma^{i}_{32}\ , \\ \gamma^{i}_{33}&=&\frac{\sqrt{35\pi}}{48}\frac{(1-\cos\xi)^2}{\sin\xi}\left[34 - 17\cos\xi-4\cos^2\xi-\cos^3\xi+96\left(\frac{1-\cos\xi}{1+\cos\xi}\right)\log\left(\sin\frac{\xi}{2}\right)\right]\ , \\ \gamma^{i}_{3 - 3}&=&-\gamma^{i}_{33}\ .\end{aligned}\ ] ] these are plotted in fig . 
 the generalized orfs of total intensity are different from that of circular polarization in that the value for @xmath149 is non - trivial . 
 then the @xmath3 mode orfs for @xmath275 have value even in the case of @xmath151 . 
 this implies that we can consider auto - correlation for a single pulsar .

2,"as a common quantum phenomenon , the tunneling through a potential barrier plays a very important role in the microscopic world and has been studied extensively since the birth of quantum mechanics . 
 one of the earliest applications of quantum tunneling is the explanation of @xmath0 decays in atomic nuclei . 
 the quantum tunneling effect governs also many other nuclear processes such as fission and fusion . 
 in particular , a lot of new features are revealed in sub - barrier fusion reactions which are closely connected with the tunneling phenomena  @xcite .    for most of the potential barriers , the penetrability can not be calculated analytically  @xcite . among those potentials for which analytical solutions can be obtained , 
 the parabolic potential  @xcite is the mostly used in the study of nuclear fusion . by approximating the coulomb barrier to a parabola 
 , wong derived an analytic expression for the fusion cross section  @xcite which is widely adopted today in the study of heavy ion reactions ( see , e.g. , recent refs . 
 the parabolic approximation works remarkably well both for the penetrability and for the fusion cross section at energies around or above the coulomb barrier  @xcite . 
 apparently the parabolic approximation breaks down at energies much smaller than the barrier height due to the long - range coulomb interaction . 
 one may calculate the penetration probability numerically by using the path integral method or the wkb approximation . 
 however , it is highly desirable to have an analytical expression for the barrier penetrability when one introduces an energy - dependent one - dimensional potential barrier  @xcite or barrier distribution functions  @xcite .    in the present work 
 , we derived a new barrier penetration formula based on the wkb approximation . 
 the influence of the long coulomb tail in the barrier potential is taken into accout properly . 
 therefore this formula is especially applicable to the barrier penetration with penetration energy much lower than the coulomb barrier .    as a first attempt and a test study 
 , we apply this new formula to evaluate @xmath0 decay half - lives of atomic nuclei . for the @xmath0 decay , 
 the penetrability is usually calculated with the wkb approach  @xcite , in other words , integrating numerically the wave number within two turning points at which the interaction potential is equal to the @xmath1-value of the @xmath0 decay . 
 we will show that the present analytical formula reproduces the experimental results very well , especially for spherical nuclei . 
 the paper is organized as follows . in sec . 
 [ sec : formalism ] we present the new barrier penetration formula . 
 the validity of the new formula is investigated and its application to @xmath0 decays are given in sec . 
 [ sec : results ] . finally in sec . 
 [ sec : summary ] we summarize our work . in the appendix , 
 the detailed derivation of the new penetration formula is given . 
 when the penetration energy is well below the coulomb barrier , the barrier penetrability formula derived from the wkb approximation reads , @xmath2 ,   \label{eq : wkb}\ ] ] where the potential usually consists of three parts , the nuclear , the coulomb , and the centrifugal potentials , @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the inner and outer turning points determined by the relation @xmath6 .    by approximating @xmath7 to a parabola with the height @xmath8 and the width @xmath9 , eq . 
 ( [ eq : wkb ] ) is reduced as @xmath10 ,   \label{eq : hw}\ ] ] which has been widely used in the study of heavy ion reactions .    because of the long - range coulomb interaction , the coulomb barrier given in eq . 
 ( [ eq : potential ] ) has a long tail and is asymmetric . 
 thus for the penetration well below the barrier , the parabolic approximation is not valid . 
 we may divide the potential barrier into two parts at the barrier position @xmath11 . 
 the first part of @xmath7 with @xmath12 could still be approximated by half of a parabola and we need to evaluate the integration in eq .

 the details of the derivation of eq . 
 ( [ eq : new ] ) are given in the appendix . 
 it should be mentioned that in the derivation of eq . 
 ( [ eq : new ] ) , a woods - saxon form is used for @xmath19 . 
 in this section , we use the new formula to study the typical barrier penetration problem , @xmath0 decays of atomic nuclei . 
 the @xmath0 decay half - life is related to the decay width @xmath20 by @xcite @xmath21 the decay width @xmath20 is calculated as  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the assaults frequency of @xmath0 particle on the barrier , @xmath24 the spectroscopic or preformation factor and @xmath25 the penetrability with @xmath1 the @xmath0 decay q - value . for spherical nuclei ,

 ( [ eq : prefomation ] ) were obtained by fitting @xmath0 decay half lives and cross section data for several fusion reactions . 
 it can be easily verified that the position of the coulomb barrier @xmath11 is larger than @xmath34 thus the use of the coulomb force given in eq . 
 ( [ eq : coul ] ) is valid . 
 before the new formula is used to study alpha decays , we investigate in details its validity . 
 first we examine how the effective potential connected with the new formula eq . 
 ( [ eq : new ] ) is close to the exact one . 
 two extreme examples are chosen for this purpose , @xmath28po which has a very short half - life @xmath35 s and @xmath29nd which has a quite long half - life @xmath36 s  @xcite . 
 the barrier potential @xmath7 is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : potential ] for these two systems . 
 the effective potential ,    @xmath37    is also shown for comparison . 
 @xmath38 fm is the radial position outside of which the nuclear part of the @xmath0-nucleus potential could be neglected ( see the appendix for more details ) . in our calculations , the width of the parabolic potential is obtained by fitting the barrier potential from the inner turning point @xmath39 to the position of the barrier @xmath11 . unlike the full parabolic approximation , 
 the effective potential is asymmetric and coincides with the exact potential very well , especially the outer side of the barrier which critically influences @xmath0 decays .

 the meaning of @xmath40 is given in eq . 
 ( [ eq : x1x2 ] ) . 
 the superscript `` wkb '' means the penetrability calculated from the wkb approach , `` para '' from the parabolic approximation in eq .

[ cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     the deformation influences the @xmath0 decay life time both on the preformation mechanism and on the penetration process  @xcite . in the present work , we have assumed the barrier potential to be spherical . in 68 of these 344 nuclei 
 , the spherical potential assumption is met well ( with @xmath41 for the daughter nucleus  @xcite ) . in table 
 [ tab : spherical ] the calculated and experimental values of the @xmath0 decay half lives for these nuclei are given . the statistical summary is also shown in the last line of table  [ tab : stati ] . 
 it is found that the new formula gives very good results for these spherical nuclei . in most cases , the differences between the calculated and the experimental values of @xmath42 are smaller than 0.5 . 
 the root mean square deviation between @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] is 0.34 . 
 in the study of barrier penetration in nuclear physics , the parabolic approximation is usually adopted because an analytical solution exists for the penetrability of a parabola barrier potential . 
 the parabola approximation works indeed well both for the penetrability and for the fusion cross section at energies around or above the coulomb barrier . 
 but it fails at energies much smaller than the barrier height due to the long - range coulomb interaction .    in the present work 
 , we derived a new barrier penetration formula , eq . 
 ( [ eq : new ] ) , based on the wkb approximation . 
 we took into account the influence of the long coulomb tail in the barrier potential properly . 
 therefore this formula is especially applicable to the barrier penetration with penetration energy much lower than the coulomb barrier . 
 we have shown that the present analytical formula reproduces the wkb results very well . 
 this new penetration formula is used to calculate @xmath0 decay half - lives of 344 nuclei with the @xmath0-nucleus potential given in ref . 
 satisfactory agreement between the present calculation and the experiment is achieved . for spherical and even - even nuclei , 
 the results are particularly good . 
 therefore , the new formula could be used in the study of barrier penetration at energies much smaller than the barrier height . 
 furthermore , we expect that the new formula will facilitate the study of the barrier penetrability where one has to introduce an energy - dependent one - dimensional potential barrier or a barrier distribution function .

3,"for the hybrid monte carlo algorithm ( hmc)@xcite , often used to study quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) on the lattice , one is interested in efficient numerical time integration schemes which are optimal in terms of computational costs per trajectory for a given acceptance rate . high order 
 numerical methods allow the use of larger step sizes , but demand a larger computational effort per step ; low order schemes do not require such large computational costs per step , but need more steps per trajectory . 
 so there is a need to balance these opposing effects . 
 omelyan integration schemes @xcite of a force - gradient type have proved to be an efficient choice , since it is easy to obtain higher order schemes that demand a small additional computational effort . 
 these schemes use higher - order information from force - gradient terms to both increase the convergence of the method and decrease the size of the leading error coefficient . other ideas to achieve better efficiency for numerical time integrators are given by multirate or nested approaches . 
 these schemes do not increase the order but reduce the computational costs per path by recognizing the different dynamical time - scales generated by different parts of the action . 
 slow forces , which are usually expensive to evaluate , need only to be sampled at low frequency while fast forces which are usually cheap to evaluate need to be sampled at a high frequency . a natural way to inherit the advantages from both force - gradient type schemes and multirate approaches would be to combine these two ideas .    previously , we studied the behavior of the adapted nested force - gradient scheme for the example of the @xmath0-body problem @xcite and would like to learn more about their usefulness for lattice field theory calculations . due to the huge computational effort required for qcd simulations , 
 it is natural to attempt an intermediate step first . 
 we chose the model problem of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in two dimensions , the schwinger model @xcite , since it is well - suited as a test case for new concepts and ideas which can be subsequently applied to more computationally demanding problems @xcite . 
 as a lattice quantum field theory , it has many of the properties of more sophisticated models such as qcd , for example the numerical cost is still dominated by the fermion part of the action . the fact that this model , with far fewer degrees of freedom , does not require such large computational effort makes it the perfect choice for testing purposes . 
 we compare the behavior of numerical time integration schemes currently used for hmc @xcite with the nested force - gradient integrator @xcite and the adapted version introduced in @xcite . 
 we investigate the computational costs needed to perform numerical calculations , as well as the effort required to achieve a satisfactory acceptance rate during the hmc evolution . 
 our goal is to find a numerical scheme for the hmc algorithm which would provide a sufficiently high acceptance rate while not drastically increasing the simulation time . 
 the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 
 we give a short overview of the hmc algorithm and numerical schemes for time integration , which are used in hmc . in section 3 
 we present the 2-dimensional schwinger model and introduce the idea of the force - gradient approach and the resulting novel class of numerical schemes . 
 section 4 is devoted to the results of a comparison between widely used algorithms and the new approach and section 5 draws our conclusion . 
 in this section we provide a general overview of the hmc algorithm @xcite to introduce our novel integrator . 
 we also present some standard numerical time integrating methods used in hmc , as well state - of - the - art numerical schemes , which we later compare by applying them to the two - dimensional schwinger model .      in the hybrid monte carlo algorithm , 
 the quantum lattice field theory is embedded in a higher - dimensional classical system through the introduction of a fictitious ( simulation ) time @xcite . 
 the gauge field @xmath1 is associated with its ( fictitious ) conjugate momenta @xmath2 , and the classical system is described by the hamiltonian , @xmath3 + { \mathcal{b}}[u],\ ] ] where @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] represent the kinetic and potential energy respectively .    for a given configuration @xmath1 , 
 a new configuration @xmath6 is generated by performing an hmc update @xmath7 , which consists of two steps :    * * molecular dynamics trajectory : * evolve the gauge fields @xmath1 , elements of a lie group , and the momenta @xmath2 , elements of the corresponding lie algebra , in a fictitious computer time @xmath8 according to hamilton s equations of motions @xmath9 since analytical solutions are not available in general , numerical methods must be used to solve the system of eqn .  . 
 the discrete updates of @xmath1 and @xmath2 with an integration step @xmath10 are @xmath11 leading to a first - order approximation at time @xmath12 . 
 since the momenta @xmath2 are elements of lie algebra , we have an additive update of @xmath2 . 
 on the other hand , the links @xmath1 must be elements of the lie group , therefore an exponential update is used for @xmath1 to preserve the underlying group structure . * * metropolis step : * accept or reject the new configuration @xmath13 with probability @xmath14 where @xmath15 .      in this paper 
 we are concerned with numerical time integration schemes , which preserve the fundamental properties of geometric integration , time - reversibility and volume - preservation . 
 all numerical schemes presented below possess these necessary properties . 
 * basic schemes : * well - known , commonly used integration schemes in molecular dynamics are given by    * the leap - frog method , a 3-stage composition scheme of the discrete updates defined above : @xmath16 * and a 5-stage extension widely used in qcd computations : @xmath17    * force gradient schemes : * force - gradient schemes increase accuracy by using additional information from the force gradient term @xmath18 , with @xmath19 defining lie brackets . the 5-stage force - gradient scheme proposed by omelyan et 
 al @xcite is the simplest ; @xmath20 here we also test the modification of the force - gradient method proposed in @xcite , where the force - gradient term @xmath21 is approximated via a taylor expansion . 
 an extension is given by the 11-stage decomposition @xcite , recently implemented as the integrator in the open source code openqcd as one of the standard options @xcite 
 @xmath22where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are parameters from equation ( 71 ) in ref . 
 @xcite .    * 
 nested schemes : * qed and qcd problems usually lead to hamiltonians with the following fine structure @xmath27 + { \mathcal{b}}_{1}[u]+ { \mathcal{b}}_{2}[u],\ ] ] where the action of the system can be split into two parts : a fast action @xmath28 such as the gauge action , and a slow part @xmath29 , for example , the fermion action . 
 this allows us to apply the idea of multirate schemes ( an idea known as nested integration in physics literature)@xcite in order to reduce the computational effort . at 
 first we consider the nested version of the leap - frog method @xmath30 where the inner cheaper system @xmath31+{\mathcal{b}}_{1}[u]$ ] is solved by @xmath32 with @xmath33 being a number of iterations for the fast part of the action . 
 our main goal is to compare the above - mentioned methods with more elaborated nested schemes : in @xcite , a similar 5-stage decomposition scheme has been recently introduced : @xmath34    a nested version of , which has been used in  @xcite reads @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in the limit @xmath39 
 we have @xmath40 . 
 note that this approach uses force - gradient information at all levels , i.e. , the high computational cost of high order schemes appears at all levels . 
 one may overcome this problem by using schemes of different order at the different levels without losing the effective high order of the overall multirate scheme . 
 for the latter , we include appropriate force gradient information as we explain in the following for the case of two time levels , where the gauge action plays the role of the fast and cheap part , and the fermionic action plays the role of the slow and expensive part . 
 the reasoning is as follows : if one uses the 5-stage sexton - weingarten integrator of second order for the slow action , and approximates the fast action by @xmath41 leap - frog steps of step size @xmath42 , the error of the overall multirate scheme will be of order @xmath43 . with the use of force gradient information only at the slowest level it is possible to cancel the leading error term of order @xmath44 . 
 as @xmath45 usually holds in the multirate setting , the overall order is then given by the leading error term of order @xmath46 , i.e. , the scheme has an effective order of four . 
 one example for such a scheme for problems of type is given by the 5-stage nested force - gradient scheme introduced in @xcite @xmath47 to summarize , the adapted scheme   differs from the original one   in two perspectives :    * the force gradient scheme for the fast action is replaced by a leap - frog scheme . * 
 only the part @xmath48 of the full force gradient @xmath49 is needed to gain the effective order of four . 
 the numerical schemes - and - are second order convergent schemes . methods - and - have the fourth order of convergence . 
 we do not consider integrators of higher order than four since the computational costs are too high . 
 the schemes of the same convergence order differ from each other by the number of stages ( updates of momenta and links per time step ) . 
 usually methods with more stages have smaller leading error coefficients and therefore have better accuracy , but higher computational costs . 
 we would like to determine which integrator would represent the best compromise between high accuracy and computational efficiency 
 .    we will apply all these numerical integration schemes  to the two - dimensional schwinger model . 
 the most challenging task from the theoretical point of view is to derive the force - gradient term @xmath21 . in the next section 
 we introduce the schwinger model and explain how to obtain the force - gradient term . 
 the 2 dimensional schwinger model is defined by the following hamiltonian function @xmath50 = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1,\mu=1}^{v,2 } p_{n,\mu}^2 + s_g[u ] + s_f[u].}\ ] ] with @xmath51 the volume of the lattice . unlike qcd , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 , for this qed problem , the links @xmath1 are the elements of the lie group @xmath54 and the momenta @xmath55 belong to @xmath56 , which represents the lie algebra of the group @xmath54 . 
 this makes this test example very cheap in terms of the computational time . 
 this together with the fact that the schwinger model also shares many of the features of qcd simulations , makes the schwinger model an excellent test example when considering numerical integrators : a fast dynamics given by the computationally cheap gauge part @xmath57 $ ] of the action demanding small step sizes , and a slow dynamics given by the computationally expensive fermion part @xmath58 $ ] allowing large step sizes . 
 the pure gauge part of the action @xmath59 sums up over all plaquettes @xmath60 in the two - dimensional lattice with @xmath61 and is given by @xmath62 the links @xmath1 can be written in the form @xmath63 and connect the sites @xmath0 and @xmath64 on the lattice ; @xmath65 $ ] , @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xmath68 are respectively space and time directions and @xmath69 is a coupling constant . 
 note that from now on we will set the lattice spacing @xmath70 . 
 the fermion part of the action @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 where @xmath26 is a complex pseudofermion field . here , @xmath73 denotes the wilson  dirac operator given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the pauli matrices @xmath76 @xmath77 is the mass parameter and the kronecker delta @xmath78 acts on the pseudofermion field by @xmath79 with @xmath80 the pseudofermion field , a vector in the two - dimensional spinor space taking values at each lattice point @xmath0 . in order to proceed with the numerical integration we need to obtain the force @xmath81 and the force gradient term @xmath21 . 
 the force term @xmath82 with respect to the link @xmath83 is given by the first derivative of the action @xmath84 and can be written as @xmath85 since the numerical schemes  use the multi - rate approach , the shifts in the momenta updates are split on @xmath86 and @xmath87 and we can consider them separately . 
 the force terms @xmath86 and @xmath87 are obtained by differentiation over @xmath54 group elements , which for the schwinger model is the standard differentiation .    the force associated with link @xmath88 from the gauge action 
 is given by @xmath89 the force term of the fermion part is given by @xmath90 \,\ ] ] where vectors @xmath91 and @xmath92 are given @xmath93    for the numerical methods and we need to find the force gradient term @xmath94 with respect to the link @xmath83 . in case of the schwinger model this term reads @xmath95    for simplicity we decompose the force gradient term in four parts @xmath96 this decomposition is also useful since the numerical integrator only uses the term @xmath97 by construction . 
 as shown in @xcite , to obtain the fourth order convergent scheme from the second order convergent method we must eliminate the leading error term , which is exactly represented by @xmath97 . for completeness we discuss all 4 parts below . 
 the @xmath98 part of the force - gradient term is @xmath99 \end{aligned}\ ] ] with the set of plaquettes @xmath100 then by using the vectors @xmath101 defined in we obtain the @xmath102 piece of the force - gradient term given by @xmath103 . }

 now the fields @xmath106 and @xmath107 are given by @xmath108 with @xmath109    in order to calculate @xmath110 and @xmath111 it is possible to perform the summation of @xmath112 before the inversions of @xmath73 and @xmath113 to get @xmath114 and @xmath115 which save @xmath116 additional inversions for the force gradient terms . 
 it follows for the force gradient term @xmath111 @xmath117\ ] ] with @xmath118 + z_1 \right ) \ , . 
 \end{aligned}\ ] ] the expression for @xmath110 can be obtained from the one for @xmath111 by replacing in and the vector @xmath119 with @xmath120 defined in . 
 it is important to mention that the computationally most demanding part of the numerical integration of the schwinger model and quantum field theory in general is the inverse of the dirac operator @xmath121 . 
 every momenta update , which includes fermion action requires 2 inversions of the dirac operator , the addition of the force - gradient term @xmath21 requires 4 more inversions . 
 therefore leap - frog based methods and need 4 computations of @xmath121 per time step ; schemes and 6 times ; force - gradient based methods 8 for and , 10 for and the 11 stage method has 12 inversions of the dirac operator . since we use the multi - rate approach for schemes , and , which leads generally to fewer macro time steps needed than for the standard schemes we expect the integrator will be the most efficient choice among the methods considered . in the next section we present numerical tests of this prediction . 
 in this section we apply the numerical integrators  to compute the molecular dynamics step for the schwinger model when studied with the hmc algorithm . 
 we consider a @xmath122 by @xmath122 lattice with a coupling constant @xmath123 and mass @xmath124 . 
 the parameters were taken from @xcite and correspond to the scaling variable @xmath125 defined in @xcite.we have chosen them to simulate close to the scaling limit with light fermions and also to increase the impact of the fermion part of the action . 
 we use one thermalised gauge configuration . for each integrator and value of the step - size 
 we generate @xmath126 independent sets of momenta and integrate the equations of motion on a trajectory of length @xmath127 . 
 we compute the absolute error @xmath128 and estimate its statistical error from the standard deviation . 
 also the parameter @xmath33 is chosen in such a way to make micro step size to be @xmath129 times smaller than the macro step size @xmath10 . 
 figure [ fig:1 ] presents the comparison between the numerical integrators  . 
 it shows the absolute error @xmath128 versus the step - size of the numerical scheme . here 
 the multi - rate schemes , , and outperform their standard versions as expected . 
 also it is easy to see that the scheme has the best accuracy and the nested force - gradient method just slightly edges the adapted nested force - gradient scheme . 
 figure [ fig:2 ] presents the cpu time , required for the proposed integrators 
 , versus the achieved accuracy . 
 we can observe that the nested force - gradient method and adapted nested force- gradient method show much better results in terms of a computational efficiency than the integrators and ; and even compared to the 11 stage scheme . 
 here we can see that the modification of proposed in @xcite also performs better than its original version . 
 it shows almost similar computational costs as nested versions of the force - gradient approach - , since it has the same number of @xmath121  ( see table [ tab:1 ] ) . 
 but it is less efficient because the proposed nested approach is more precise . 
 .step - sizes and number of inversions of @xmath73 per step and per trajectory for acceptance rate of 90% [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     table [ tab:1 ] shows the number of inversions of the dirac operator @xmath73 , which is needed to reach 90% acceptance rate of the hmc . since @xmath121 is the most computationally demanding part it is important to see how many of these inversions are required per each trajectory . from table 
 [ tab:1 ] it easy to see that the adapted nested force - gradient method and nested force - gradient method need the least number of @xmath121 per trajectory to reach the chosen acceptance rate @xmath130 . 
 we can also claim that methods and have a potential to perform even better with respect to the computational effort in the case of lattice qcd problems , since the impact of the fermion action and the computational time to obtain the inversion of the dirac operator @xmath73 is much more significant . 
 we presented the nested force - gradient approach and its adapted version applied to a model problem in quantum field theory , the two - dimensional schwinger model . 
 the derivation of the force - gradient terms was given and the schwinger model was introduced . 
 nested force - gradient schemes seem to be an optimal choice with relatively high convergence order and low computational effort . 
 also it would be possible to improve the algorithm by measuring the poisson brackets of the shadow hamiltonian of the proposed integrator and then tuning the set of optimal parameters , e.  g. micro and macro step sizes . 
 + in future work we will apply this approach to the hmc algorithm for numerical integration in lattice qcd . here 
 we expect the adapted nested - force gradient scheme to outperform the original one , if we further partition the action into more than two parts , by using techniques to factorize the fermion determinant : less force - gradient information is needed for the most expensive action , and only leap - frog steps are needed for the high frequency parts of the action .

4,"recently it was discovered that feynman integrals obey functional equations @xcite , @xcite . 
 different examples of functional equations were presented in refs . 
 @xcite , @xcite,@xcite . in these articles 
 only one - loop integrals were considered .    in the present paper 
 we propose essentially new methods for deriving functional equations . 
 these methods are based on algebraic relations between propagators and they are suitable for deriving functional equations for multi - loop integrals . also these methods can be used to derive functional equations for integrals with some propagators raised to non - integer powers . 
 our paper is organized as follows . in sec . 
 2 . the method proposed in ref .  @xcite is shortly reviewed .    in sec . 
 3 . a method for finding algebraic relations between products of propagators is formulated . 
 we describe in detail derivation of explicit relations for products of two , three and four propagators . 
 also algebraic relation for products of arbitrary number of proparators is given . 
 these relations are used in sec.4 . to obtain functional equations for some one- , as well as two- loop integrals . 
 in particular functional equation for the massless one - loop vertex type integral is presented . also functional equation for the two - loop vertex type integral with arbitrary masses 
 is given .    in sec . 
 another method for obtaining functional equations is proposed . 
 the method is based on finding algebraic relations for ` deformed propagators ' and further conversion of integrals with ` deformed propagators ' to usual feynman integrals by imposing conditions on deformation parameters . to perform such a conversion the @xmath0- parametric representation for both types of integrals 
 is exploited . 
 the method was used to derive functional equation for the two - loop vacuum type integral with arbitrary masses . as a by product , from this functional equation we obtained new hypergeometric representation for the one - loop massless vertex integral .    in conclusion 
 we formulate our vision of the future applications and developments of the proposed methods . 
 the method for deriving functional equations proposed in ref . 
 @xcite is based on the use different kind of recurrence relations . in particular in refs . 
 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , generalized recurrence relations @xcite were utilized to obtain functional equations for one - loop feynman integrals . in general such recurrence relations 
 connect a combination of some number of integrals @xmath1 corresponding to diagrams , say , with @xmath2 lines and integrals corresponding to diagrams with fewer number of lines . diagrams with fewer number of lines can be obtained by contracting some lines in integrals with @xmath2 lines . 
 integrals corresponding to such diagrams depend on fewer number of kinematical variables and masses compared to integrals with @xmath2 lines . 
 such recurrence relations can be written in the following form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are ratios of polynomials depending on masses @xmath6 , scalar products @xmath7 of external momenta , powers of propagators @xmath8 and parameter of the space time dimension @xmath9 . at the left hand - side of eq . 
 ( [ nconnectr ] ) we combined integrals with @xmath2 lines and on the right hand - side integrals with fewer number of lines .    in accordance with the method of ref . 
 @xcite , to obtain functional equation from eq . 
 ( [ nconnectr ] ) one should eliminate terms on the left hand - side by defining some kinematical variables from the set of equations : @xmath10 if there is a nontrivial solution of this system and for this solution some @xmath11 are different from zero then the right - hand side of eq . 
 ( [ nconnectr ] ) will represent functional equation . 
 for the one - loop integrals with @xmath2 propagators @xmath12 where @xmath13 different types of recurrence relations were given in refs . 
 @xcite , @xcite . 
 diagram corresponding to this integral is given in figure 1 . 
 external legs ]    in refs . 
 @xcite , @xcite the following relation was derived : @xmath14 where the operators @xmath15 shift index of propagators by one unit @xmath16 , @xmath17 
 @xmath18 @xmath19 here @xmath20 are external momenta going through lines @xmath21 respectively , and @xmath22 is mass attributed to @xmath23-th line . 
 gram determinant @xmath24 and modified cayley determinant @xmath25 are polynomials depending on scalar products and masses . 
 it is assumed that these scalar products are made of @xmath9 dimensional vectors and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are not subject to any restriction or condition specific to some integer values of @xmath9 . 
 ( [ reducedtod ] ) is written in the form corresponding to eq . 
 ( [ nconnectr ] ) . to eliminate integrals with @xmath2 lines on the left hand - side of eq . 
 ( [ reducedtod ] ) the following conditions to be hold : @xmath26    eq . 
 ( [ reducedtod ] ) is valid for arbitrary kinematical variables and masses . 
 solution of eqs . 
 ( [ sharik ] ) can be easily done with respect to two kinematical variables or masses . 
 starting from @xmath27 substitution of such solutions into eq . 
 ( [ reducedtod ] ) gives nontrivial functional equations . 
 the method for obtaining functional equations by eliminating complicated integrals from recurrence relations is quite general one . 
 however for multi loop integrals , depending on several kinematical variables , derivation of equations like eq . 
 ( [ reducedtod ] ) is computationally challenging . in the next sections we will describe easier and more powerful methods that can be used for deriving functional equations for multi - loop integrals . 
 setting @xmath28 in eq . 
 ( [ reducedtod ] ) and imposing conditions ( [ sharik ] ) leads to the following equation : @xmath29 in eq . 
 ( [ fe_n_points ] ) integrands of @xmath30 are products of @xmath31 propagators depending on different external momenta , i.e. each term in this relation corresponds to the same function but with different arguments . 
 in fact functional equations considered in refs . 
 @xcite are of the same form as eq . 
 ( [ fe_n_points ] ) . 
 the question naturally arises : this relationship holds for integrals or it can be obtained as the consequence of a relationship between integrands ?    by inspecting eq . 
 ( [ fe_n_points ] ) , one can suggest the following form of the relation between products of propagators of integrands : @xmath32 where @xmath33 in what follows we will omit @xmath34 term assuming that all masses have such a correction . 
 additionally we assume that vectors @xmath35 are linearly dependent , i.e. the gram determinant for the set of vectors @xmath36 is equal to zero . 
 such a condition is valid for all examples considered in refs . 
 @xcite , @xcite . 
 now let s consider in detail implementation of our prescription for products of 2,3 and 4 propagators . at @xmath37 relation ( [ usual_props ] ) 
 reads : @xmath38 where @xmath39 according to our assumption three vectors @xmath40,@xmath41,@xmath42 are linearly dependent . without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath43 furthermore , we assume that @xmath44 will be integration momentum and scalar quantities @xmath45,@xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath47 do not depend on @xmath44 . 
 putting all terms in eq . 
 ( [ 2prop_relation ] ) over a common denominator and then equating to zero the coefficients in front of various products of @xmath48 , @xmath49,@xmath50 yields the following system of equations : @xmath51 solution of this system of equations is : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a root of the equation @xmath54 with @xmath55 this solution can be rewritten in an explicit form : @xmath56 where @xmath57    now let s find algebraic relation for the products of three propagators . at @xmath27 eq . 
 ( [ usual_props ] ) reads : @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 are defined in eq.([p1p2p3 ] ) and @xmath62 in complete analogy with the previous case we can represent one momentum as a combination of other ones . without loss of generality we may write @xmath63 where @xmath64 for the time being are arbitrary coefficients . putting all terms in eq . 
 ( [ 3prop_relation ] ) over a common denominator and then equating to zero the coefficients in front of various products of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 yields the following system of equations : @xmath69 solving these equations for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 is solution of the equation @xmath75 here @xmath76    let us now turn to the derivation of algebraic relation for the product of four propagators . at @xmath77 
 ( [ usual_props ] ) reads : @xmath78 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61,@xmath79 are defined in eqs . 
 ( [ p1p2p3 ] ) , ( [ d4 ] ) , @xmath80 and @xmath81 is a linear combination of vectors @xmath40,  ,@xmath82 , @xmath83 putting all terms in eq . 
 ( [ 4prop_relation ] ) over a common denominator and then equating to zero the coefficients in front of different products of @xmath48 , @xmath84 yields system of equations : @xmath85 solving this system for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath70,@xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a solution of the equation @xmath91 with @xmath92    eqs . 
 ( [ 3prop_relation ] ) , ( [ 3prop_relation ] ) and ( [ 4prop_relation ] ) will be used in the next sections to derive functional equations for the propagator , vertex and box type of integrals . 
 relations between products of five and more propagators can be easily derived in the same way as as it was done for products of two- , three- and four- propagators . from eq . 
 ( [ usual_props ] ) one can derive system of equations and find its solution for arbitrary @xmath2 . 
 multiplying both sides of eq . 
 ( [ usual_props ] ) by the product of @xmath93 propagators @xmath94 yields @xmath95 or @xmath96 since we assume linear dependence of vectors @xmath97 , without loss of generality we may write : @xmath98 substituting ( [ pnp1 ] ) into eq.([ini_equ ] ) , collecting terms in front of @xmath48 , @xmath84 and terms without @xmath44 , equating them to zero after some simplifications yields the following system of @xmath99 equations : @xmath100 solving eq . 
 ( [ sumy ] ) for one of the @xmath64 an substituting this solution into eq . 
 ( [ kwadraticy ] ) gives quadratic equation for the remaining @xmath64 . 
 this quadratic equation can be solved with respect to one of the parameters @xmath64 . 
 thus the solution of the system of equations ( [ xequs ] ) , ( [ sumy ] ) , ( [ kwadraticy ] ) will depend on @xmath101 arbitrary parameters @xmath64 and one arbitrary mass @xmath102 . 
 it is interesting to note that for any @xmath2 , functional equations for integrals with all masses equal to zero and functional equations for integrals with all masses equal are the same . in case of equal masses , two mass dependent terms in eq . 
 ( [ kwadraticy ] ) cancel each other due to eq . 
 ( [ sumy ] ) . in both cases systems of equations for @xmath103 , 
 @xmath104 are the same and therefore arguments of integrals are the same . 
 ( [ 2prop_relation ] ) is analogous to the equation for splitting propagators presented in ref . 
 ( [ 3prop_relation ] ) is a generalization of eq . 
 ( [ 2prop_relation ] ) . indeed , setting @xmath105 , canceling common factor @xmath61 on both sides of eq . 
 ( [ 3prop_relation ] ) yields relation similar to ( [ 2prop_relation ] ) . in turn 
 ( [ 4prop_relation ] ) is a generalization of ( [ 3prop_relation ] ) . 
 multiplying algebraic relations ( [ 2prop_relation]),([3prop_relation ] ) , ( [ 4prop_relation ] ) by products of any number of propagators raised to arbitrary powers @xmath106 @xmath107^{\nu_j}}\ ] ] and integrating with respect to @xmath44 we get a functional equation for one - loop integrals . 
 ( [ 2prop_relation ] ) , ( [ 3prop_relation ] ) , ( [ 4prop_relation ] ) also can be used to derive functional equations for integrals with any number of loops . 
 multiplying algebraic relations for propagators by function corresponding to feynman integral depending on momentum @xmath44 and any number of external momenta and then integrating with respect to @xmath44 will produce functional equations . 
 just for demonstrational purposes we present graphically in figure 2 functional equation based on @xmath2 propagator relation . 
 - propagator functional equation ]    the blob on this picture correspond to either product of propagators raised to arbitrary powers or to an integral with any number of loops and external legs . 
 one of the external momenta of this multi loop integral should be @xmath44 . 
 in this section several particular examples of functional equations resulting from algebraic relations for products of propagators will be considered . 
 first , we consider the simplest case , namely , functional equation for the integral @xmath108 : @xmath109           [ ( k_1-p_k)^2-m_k^2]}.\ ] ] integrating both sides of eq . 
 ( [ 2prop_relation ] ) with respect to @xmath44 , we get : @xmath110 the arguments @xmath111 , @xmath112 of integrals on the right hand - side depend on @xmath113 , @xmath47 @xmath114 substituting solution for @xmath64 from eq . 
 ( [ y_for_2prop ] ) into eq . 
 ( [ p13_p23 ] ) yields : @xmath115 in this equation @xmath116 is an arbitrary parameter and can be taken at will . functional equation ( [ prop_fe ] ) 
 is in agreement with the result presented in refs . 
 @xcite,@xcite . 
 functional equations for the vertex type integral @xmath117           [ ( k_1-p_2)^2-m_2 ^ 2 ]       [ ( k_1-p_3)^2-m_3 ^ 2 ]       } , \label{i3definition }      \end{aligned}\ ] ] can be obtained from eq . 
 ( [ 2prop_relation ] ) as well as from eq . 
 ( [ 3prop_relation ] ) . 
 multiplying eq . 
 ( [ 2prop_relation ] ) with the factor @xmath118 where @xmath119 and integrating over @xmath44 leads to the equation : @xmath120 this equation in terms of integrals @xmath121 reads @xmath122 two more functional equations can be obtained from eq . 
 ( [ fe_for_vertex ] ) by symmetric permutations @xmath123 and @xmath124 . 
 another functional equation for the vertex type integral can be obtained by integrating eq . 
 ( [ 3prop_relation ] ) with respect to @xmath44 : @xmath125 where @xmath126 there is an essential difference between functional equation eq . 
 ( [ fei3massiv ] ) obtained from eq . 
 ( [ 2prop_relation ] ) and functional equation ( [ fei3massive ] ) derived from eq . 
 ( [ 3prop_relation ] ) . 
 for example , at @xmath127 , eq .  ( [ fei3massiv ] ) becomes trivial while from eq . 
 ( [ fei3massive ] ) for the integral @xmath128 we obtain nontrivial functional equation : @xmath129 where @xmath74 is a root of the quadratic equation @xmath130    if one argument of @xmath131 is zero then by applying functional equation ( [ fe_triangle ] ) such an integral can be expressed in terms of integrals @xmath121 with two arguments equal to zero . 
 for example , at @xmath132 and @xmath133 the relation ( [ fe_triangle ] ) becomes : @xmath134 this is a typical example how functional equations can be used to simplify evaluation of an integral by reducing it to a combination of integrals with fewer number of arguments .    at @xmath135 , similar to the previous case , eq.([fei3massiv ] ) degenerate while from eq.([fei3massive ] ) for the integral @xmath136 we obtain nontrivial functional equation : @xmath137 where @xmath74 is a root of the quadratic equation @xmath138 eqs . 
 ( [ fe_triangle_eqm ] ) , ( [ l3_eqm ] ) are identical to eqs . 
 ( [ fe_triangle]),([lambda3_zero_masses ] ) respectively and therefore functional equation for the integral with massless propagators and functional equation for the integral with all masses equal are the same . 
 ( [ fe_triangle_eqm ] ) at @xmath132 and @xmath133 leads to the relation similar to ( [ 1zero_2zeros ] ) : @xmath139 this is not surprising because coefficients of the eq . 
 ( [ fe_triangle_eqm ] ) are mass independent and in the integrand @xmath140 and @xmath34 appear in the covariant combination @xmath141 . 
 for this reason the similarity of functional equations for massless integrals and integrals with all masses equal take place for integrals with more external legs and more loops . 
 functional equations for the box type integrals can be obtained by multiplying relation ( [ 2prop_relation ] ) by two propagators , or by multiplying relation ( [ 3prop_relation ] ) by one propagator and then integrating over momentum @xmath44 . yet 
 another relation can be obtained just by integrating eq . 
 ( [ 4prop_relation ] ) over momentum @xmath44 : @xmath142 here @xmath90 is defined in eq . 
 ( [ lambda4 ] ) and @xmath143,@xmath144 , @xmath145 are arbitrary parameters and @xmath146 arbitrary parameters in this functional equation can be chosen from the requirement of simplicity of evaluation of integrals on the right hand - side of eq . 
 ( [ box_func_equ ] ) or from some other requirements . 
 for example , one can choose these parameters by transforming arguments to a certain kinematical region needed for analytic continuation of the original integral .      the method described in the previous section can be applied to multi loop integrals . 
 consider , for example , integral corresponding to the diagram given in figure 3 .

 ( [ 2prop_relation ] ) by the one - loop integral depending on @xmath44 @xmath147 [ ( k_1-k_2)^2-m_5 ^ 2]}\ ] ] and integrate with respect to momentum @xmath44 
 then we obtain functional equation @xmath148 where @xmath149[(k_2-q_2)^2-m_2 ^ 2 ] [ k_1 ^ 2-m_3 ^ 2][(k_1-k_2)^2-m_4 ^ 2 ] } , \label{rdefinition}\end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath150 integrals of this type arise , for example , in calculations of two - loop radiative corrections in the electroweak theory . instead of the integral @xmath151 one can consider derivative of @xmath152 with respect to @xmath116 which is uv finite : @xmath153[(k_2-q_2)^2-m_2 ^ 2 ] [ k_1 ^ 2-m_3 ^

 the main profit from functional equations for @xmath152 and @xmath154 comes from the fact that vertex integrals were expressed in terms of simpler , propagator type integrals . 
 the method described in the previous section does not work for deriving functional equations for all kinds of feynman integrals . 
 for example , we did not found functional equation for the two - loop vacuum type integral given in figure 4 .        in this section 
 we shall describe another method that extends the class of integrals for which we can obtain functional equations . 
 the method is based on transformation of functional equations for some auxiliary integrals depending on arbitrary parameters into functional equations for integrals of interest . 
 such functional equations will be derived from algebraic relations for ` deformed propagators ' which will be defined in the next section . 
 these auxiliary integrals will be transformed into @xmath0 parametric representation . in general characteristic polynomials of these integrals in @xmath0 parametric representation 
 differ from those for the investigated integral . functional equation for the integral of interest 
 can be obtained in case when it will be possible to map characteristic polynomials of auxiliary integrals with ` deformed propagators ' to characteristic polynomials of this integral . 
 such a mapping will be performed by rescaling @xmath0 parameters and appropriate choice of arbitrary ` deforming parameters ' .      in the previous section to derive functional equation we added to our consideration a propagator with combination of external momenta taken with arbitrary scalar coefficient . 
 now we consider generalization of this method .    to find functional equation for @xmath168-loop feynman integral depending on @xmath169- external momenta we start from the relation of the form @xmath170 where @xmath171 is defined as : @xmath172 with @xmath173 and @xmath174 , @xmath175 for the time being are arbitrary scalar parameters . 
 some of these parameters as well as @xmath176 will be fixed from the equation ( [ x_parameters ] ) . 
 another part of these parameters will be fixed from the requirement that the product of propagators in ( [ x_parameters ] ) should correspond to the integrand of the integral with the considered topology . 
 we would like to remark that instead of deformation of propagators proposed in eqs . 
 ( [ deformed_prop]),([deformed_momentum ] ) one can use other deformations . 
 for example , all terms in denominators of propagators can be taken with arbitrary scalar coefficients : @xmath177    to establish algebraic relation ( [ x_parameters ] ) we put all terms over a common denominator and then equate coefficients in front scalar products depending on integration momenta . 
 solving obtained system of equations gives some restrictions on the scalar parameters . 
 in general integrals obtained by integrating products of ` deformed propagators ' will not correspond to usual feynman integrals . 
 further restrictions on parameters should be imposed in order to obtain relations between integrals corresponding to feynman integrals coming from a realistic quantum field theory models . 
 as an example , let us consider derivation of functional equation for the two - loop vacuum type integral given in figure 4 : @xmath178 analytic expression for this integral was presented in ref @xcite . instead of this integral 
 we will first consider an auxiliary integral with integrand made from ` deformed propagators ' defined in eqs.([deformed_prop ] ) , ( [ deformed_momentum ] ) : @xmath179 where @xmath180 for the product of three deformed propagators one can try to find an algebraic relation of the form : @xmath181 where @xmath182 , @xmath183,@xmath184 are defined in eq.([d123_for2loop_bubble ] ) and @xmath185 here @xmath186 are arbitrary masses , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 are undetermined parameters and @xmath44 , @xmath192 will be integration momenta 
 .      we would like to notice that eq . 
 ( [ equ_with_redefined_masses2 ] ) is valid for integrals but not for their integrands . 
 this is due to the fact that the factor in front of integral that comes from the scaling of @xmath0 parameters in parametric integral is not fully compensated by scaling momenta given in eq . 
 ( [ scaling_momenta ] ) .    at @xmath246 
 the dependence on all parameters @xmath247,@xmath248,@xmath249 in eqs . 
 ( [ equ_with_redefined_masses_mm4nz ] ) , ( [ equ_with_redefined_masses2 ] ) drops out and the integral @xmath250 reduces to a comination of simpler integrals : @xmath251    analytic expression for the integral @xmath201 with one mass equal to zero is known @xcite . under assumption that @xmath252 it reads @xmath253}}. \label{j0_hgf}\ ] ] from functional equation ( [ j0_mm4_zero ] ) as a by - product 
 one can get a new hypergeometric representation for the one - loop massless vertex type integral . in ref . 
 @xcite an interesting relation between the dimensionally regularized one - loop vertex type integral @xmath254 and the two - dimensional integral @xmath255 was discovered @xmath256 functional equation ( [ j0_mm4_zero ] ) with @xmath257 defined in eq . 
 ( [ j0_hgf ] ) provide us a new hypergeometric representation for the integral @xmath121 with massless propagators . 
 formula for the one - loop massless vertex integral in terms of other gauss hypergeometric functions is given in ref . 
 finally , we summarize what we have accomplished in this paper . 
 first of all , we formulated new methods for deriving functional equations for feynman integrals . 
 these methods are rather simple and do not use any kind of integration by parts techniques . 
 second , it was shown that integrals with many kinematic arguments can be reduced to a combination of simpler integrals with fewer arguments . in our future publications 
 we are going to demonstrate that in some cases applying functional equations one can reduce , the so - called , master integrals to a combination of simpler integrals from , what we would like to call , a ` universal ' basis of integrals . 
 the method based on algebraic relations for ` deformed propagators ' can be used not only for vacuum type of integrals but also for integrals depending on external momenta . in the present paper we considered rather particular cases of functional equations . 
 the systematic investigation and classification of the proposed functional equations requires application of the methods of algebraic geometry and group theory .    at the present moment 
 it is not quite clear whether functional equations derivable from recurrence relations can be reproduced by the methods of algebraic relations between products of propagators described in section 3 and section 5 . 
 a detailed consideration of our functional equations and their application to the one - loop integrals with four , five and six external legs as well as to some two- and three- loop feynman integrals will be presented in future publications .

5,"one of the main goals of the search for periodic isolated sources of gravitational waves ( g.w . ) is to perform all sky surveys , based on `` blind searches '' , where the source parameters are unknown . in this case 
 hierarchical procedures are applied , based on a sequence of increasing resolution steps . in this paper 
 we study in details the problem of sensitivity loss due to discretization of parameters and to the needs to limit the computing cost , with hough procedures . 
 in particular , we propose and study the characteristics of a frequency hough procedure , designed mainly to reduce the discretization problem , and we compare it with the sky hough procedure , which is actually used in the virgo collaboration . 
 + the paper is organized as follows : in sect . 
 2 we present the basic scheme of the rome hierarchical procedure , based on the main idea of coincidences among subsets of data ; in sect . 
 3 we discuss the limits due to digitization of the sky hough procedure ; in sects . 4 , 5 we present the new frequency hough procedure , discussing details its implementation and its basic characteristics ; in sect . 
 6 we present the study of amplitude losses due to digitization , and thus efficiencies , for both the procedures . 
 conclusions and comments are given in sect . 
 hierarchical procedures , based on hough transform algorithms , are applied by various groups in the g.w . community . 
 see , for example , references @xcite . 
 there are various ways of implementing the hierarchical procedure and the hough transform . 
 the hough transform is a linear transform that is used to recognize the parameters of the analytical description of a curve from the position of some points on it . 
 it operates on an `` image '' of points , in our case the peakmap in the time - frequency plane . for each peak of this map 
 we increase a set of bins of a multi - dimensional histogram ( in our case a two - dimensional histogram ) defined on the parameters space , called the hough map . in the old procedure , 
 the parameter space was the position of the source , i.e. the celestial sphere , and we fixed the spin down value for each hough map . in the new one , 
 the parameter space is the plane @xmath0 , and for each hough map , we fix the position of the source . the mapping ( i.e. which points of the hough map must be increased for a certain point in the peakmap ) can be done in different ways : we use always what we call the `` biunivocal mapping '' , i.e. a mapping in which every point in the hough map derive from a single point of the peakmap at a given time . 
 it is easy to demonstrate that in this case the mapping is also uniform , i.e. in the case of uniformly distributed random dots in the peakmap , the expected value of the hough map @xmath1 is a constant ( for all parameter value ) . 
 this value , depending on the number n of the spectra of the peakmap and on the mapping , defines the `` noise '' of the map . 
 it is binomially distributed with parameters n and @xmath2 . 
 we will refer here to the rome scheme , presently used in virgo data . 
 [ fig : schema ] shows the basic scheme of the rome hierarchical procedure . 
 details on the main aspects of the procedure are given in references @xcite . 
 after data cleaning ( short time domain disturbances removal ) and `` short ffts data base '' ( sfdb ) creation , peakmaps are computed , using a very refined auto - regressive algorithm to equalize the spectral data by an appropriate follow - up of the noise . 
 peakmaps are frequency vs time maps , obtained from equalized spectra by selecting all the local maxima above a chosen threshold . 
 an accurate cleaning of peakmaps , by removing known noise lines and the more persistent lines , is needed and its implementation is critical for the next step analysis . on the cleaned peakmaps , 
 methods of peaks detection are applied . 
 that is , transformation from the input plane to the hough plane , thresholding and first order candidates selection . 
 candidate parameters are defined by source frequency , celestial coordinates , first spin - down parameter . 
 the need for coincidences among candidates obtained in different subsets of data ( two in the scheme of fig . 
 [ fig : schema ] ) has been discussed in references @xcite . 
 this method is very efficient to reduce the number of spurious candidates at a fixed threshold . 
 thus , for a given false alarm probability , we can lower the threshold -with respect to the choice of not doing coincidences- gaining in detection efficiency . 
 the method has a better efficiency when the data sets have similar sensitivities . 
 after the coincidence , the survived candidates are analyzed coherently with longer ffts on corrected data . 
 then the spectral filtering is used to take into account the spread of the power in five bands , as explained in reference @xcite . 
 finally , second order candidates are produced . 
 as stated before , the sky hough method shows amplitude losses , and thus loss of sensitivity , which are due to digitization of parameters . 
 this effect shows up mainly for the complexity of the transform together with the need of reducing the computing cost :    * the method is based on a transform between the time - frequency peakmap and the celestial sphere . 
 it is not simple for the non linearity of the mapping ; * to reduce the computational effort , we need to use `` look - up tables '' which introduce further digitization errors ; * to reduce the computational effort , fast algorithms have been developed , which require the use of a rectangular grid to map the sky . compared to the `` optimal '' ( see later ) grid , the rectangular one has over - resolution in some regions of the sky . 
 this leads also to a higher number of candidates . 
 * the use of the celestial map as the space to spot the candidates is very prone to artifacts , see @xcite : some regions are always `` privileged '' , that is they have a higher candidates number with respect to the expectation . the problem arises because each hough map is constructed over the whole sky .    hence , it seemed important the study of alternative procedures . 
 given the observation that most of the problems are related to the complexity of the transformation , we exploit the possibility of the use of a different but simpler transformation . a part the simplicity of the transformation we obviously need to study a procedure which is less , or equivalently , computationally expensive . 
 therefore we studied a procedure which has a better , or equivalent , sensitivity , at the same computational cost of the sky hough . 
 the transformation we propose transforms the * time - observed frequency * plane into the * source frequency - spin down * plane . let 
 s go into details . if @xmath3 is the frequency ( doppler corrected for a given sky direction ) , @xmath4 the source intrinsic frequency , @xmath5 the first spin - down parameter , @xmath6 the time at the detector and @xmath7 a reference time , we have that @xmath8 a straight line in the hough plane . 
 we then get the following : @xmath9 each point in the input plane @xmath10 , that is a peak in the doppler shifted peakmap , is transformed into a straight line in the hough @xmath11 plane , with slope @xmath12 . 
 the slope depends on the choice of the reference time . 
 if we choose @xmath7 equal to the beginning time of the data we analyze , then the slope is always negative and inversely proportional to the time gap . 
 + this is the choice we have done here . in addition , considering the width @xmath13 of the frequency bins in the input plane we notice that each peak is transformed into a stripe among two parallel straight lines    @xmath14    it is a linear transformation . 
 now the input plane is obtained from the original peakmap by correcting it for the doppler shift due to the earth revolution and rotation , for each point in the sky grid we need to analyze . 
 thus `` time '' is the time at the detector and `` frequency '' the observed frequency , after the doppler correction . 
 but , as each sfdb is short enough to not be affected by a time - varying doppler shift , then the doppler effect removal from the original peakmap , obtained from the collection of all the sfdb data , reduces to a very simple `` shifting '' procedure of the peakmap bins . in the analysis scheme , this bins shift is part of the hough procedure . + in the following , we give details on the construction of the map . 
 the frequency hough map is constructed using the `` direct differential method '' , as is done with the sky hough . with this method , instead of building directly the hough map , one builds a map that , if `` integrated '' ( i.e. summed over bins from left to right ) , gives the hough map . 
 this is important to minimize the number of floating point operations . 
 as already explained , for each sky position , the input peakmap is got from the original one by shifting bins to correct for the doppler effect . 
 the sky is sampled with a non uniform covering grid , which will be later discussed . here 
 we explain in detail the technique , by giving the sequence of operations :    * for each point in the sky grid , for each coordinate in the input plane @xmath10 and for each spin - down value @xmath15 ,    the map is incremented by 1 in the point @xmath16 and decremented by 1 in the point @xmath17 .    hence , 
 for each sky position , a differential map is constructed . 
 the sum of the bins along the frequency direction is then performed to construct the final integral map . 
 this two dimensional histogram is the frequency hough map . in the algorithm implementation 
 we plan to divide the input peakmap into 10 hz bands , thus constructing , for each position in the sky , a different hough map every 10 hz . 
 + in case there is the need to exploit higher order one spin down parameters , one ( or more ) loop(s ) has ( have ) to be added to the sequence of operations , to scan the discrete set of values of the new parameter(s ) . 
 this clearly influences the computing cost , but does not change the basics of the method . 
 let s first discuss two peculiar aspects of this new method , which are the basis of its appeal .      from the given analysis scheme , it is easy to see that the frequency resolution for the estimation of the source frequency @xmath4 can be enhanced , with respect to the binning frequency @xmath13 , without relevantly affecting the computational effort . 
 in fact , the use of a resolution @xmath18 with @xmath19 , affects only the size of the hough map . 
 this has a computational cost only when summing over the bins to construct the integral map from the differential one . 
 but we notice that the total cost of the construction of the hough map is due to the construction of the differential map , dominated by the number of peaks in the peakmap and to the construction of the integral map , dominated by the number of bins . 
 the former , in all practical cases , is the one which dominates . 
 + the possibility to enhance the frequency resolution results to be , as will be shown in the next sections , a very important peculiarity of the new method . 
 it which enhances considerably the efficiency , by reducing the digitalization effect . 
 the same in the sky hough procedure would have a relevant computational cost . 
 regarding the increasing of the spin down resolution , it would cost for both the procedures : the better the resolution in the spin down estimation the higher is the number of loops of the procedures .      here 
 we describe how we construct the grid on the sky . 
 suppose two sources , at the same frequency @xmath4 and same latitude @xmath20 . 
 their angular delay @xmath21 with respect to the detector rotation produces a time delay @xmath22 . 
 the two sources will then have the same frequency variation at the detector , which is the classical equation due to the doppler effect , @xmath23 but with time delay @xmath24 . 
 the observed frequency difference has thus a maximum value which is given by @xmath25 thus the angular resolution is , in radians : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of points in the doppler band for a signal of max frequency @xmath4 : @xmath28 and @xmath29 . 
 + we now repeat the same reasoning , supposing the two sources , at the same frequency @xmath4 and same longitude @xmath30 . 
 the two sources will have the same frequency variation at the detector , now given by @xmath31 , but with an angular delay @xmath32 . 
 the observed frequency difference has a maximum value which is : @xmath33 we obtain for the angular resolution , in radians : @xmath34 using eqs . 
 [ gammalong ] and [ gammalat ] we get : @xmath35 @xmath36 using these equations we construct the grid on the sky , which we call the `` optimal '' grid . 
 the points of the grid are not uniformly distributed . with a simulation 
 , we have estimated the the number of points in the grid @xmath37 , which is , in the high frequency limit : @xmath38 @xmath39 is an extra resolution factor , which can be greater than 1 , to enhance the efficiency , but even less than 1 , to save computing cost , obviously worsening the efficiency . 
 fig.[fig : gridsim1 ] shows the optimal sky grid , for @xmath40 ( which corresponds to a source frequency @xmath41 hz ) . 
 as already said , the grid used in the sky hough method , is not optimal , but rectangular , to use fastest computing algorithms . 
 the number of points in this rectangular grid is : @xmath42 which is , asymptotically , a factor @xmath43 higher then the number of points of the optimal grid . in fact 
 this grid has to be over resolved to maintain the same sensitivity of the corresponding optimal grid . 
 further , we note that this over resolution produces a higher number of candidates from certain sky positions .    , 
 x - axis : ecliptical longitude , degrees , from 0 to 400 ; y - axis : ecliptical latitude , degrees , from -100 to 100 ; the number of points in the map is @xmath37=2902.,width=453 ]          the sensitivity of the sky hough procedure is affected by artifacts , i.e. an excess of candidates in some places of the sky map , which are due to local spectral disturbances . the effect ca nt be eliminated because each map is constructed over the whole sky , and hence the threshold for candidate selection has to be the same for the whole sky . using the frequency hough procedure 
 this effect disappears because each map is constructed for only one position in the sky . 
 so , because of the adaptivity of the threshold , if a sky region gives an excess of candidates , the threshold is raised and then there is a loss in sensitivity only for that sky region . 
 we are now ready to enter into details by studying the efficiency of both the methods , by the use of simulations . 
 figure [ fig : gridsim2 ] is an example of how a frequency hough map looks like , having injected into white noise three signals , at different frequencies and spin - down .      to study the efficiency of the methods , as a function of the frequency over resolution factor 
 , we have simulated a signal in the absence of noise . 
 the reason for this is that we were interested in studying only the losses due to the discretization errors . 
 the parameters chosen for the simulation are similar to actual situations ( detector parameters , source expected parameters ) . 
 the parameters of the simulation are shown in table [ tab : par ] . 
 [ fig : freqloss ] shows the amplitude loss versus the frequency over resolution factor @xmath45 . 
 the loss was calculated as the average value of all the peaks found in the 500 spectra ( it is important to remember that our procedure considers peaks only the maxima above threshold ) . 
 the result is clear : using @xmath46 the amplitude loss is 3.6 @xmath47 ( the efficiency @xmath48 ) , while with @xmath49 , which is the only practically possible choice of the sky hough , the amplitude loss is 11.6 @xmath47 ( the efficiency @xmath50 ) . from the figure , 
 we notice that there is no further gain of increasing the over resolution factor over 10 . 
 thus , we fixed to 10 the over resolution factor for the frequency hough . 
 in next simulations , results with @xmath46 are thus for the frequency hough , results with @xmath49 are for the sky hough . 
 once we have fixed the frequency over resolution factor we wanted to quantify how the increasing of the spin down resolution from the nominal one would affect the sensitivity . 
 the results are in fig . 
 [ fig : freqloss1 ] , which shows the loss in amplitude vs the spin down over resolution factor , for both the cases @xmath49 , sky hough , and @xmath46,frequency hough . 
 it can be noticed that , in the case of the frequency hough , even for the worst analyzed situation , which corresponds to the nominal spin down step @xmath51 the loss is quite small . 
 is is 3.6 @xmath47 ( the efficiency @xmath48 ) . 
 the situation is worst for the sky hough , where the loss in amplitude at the nominal spin down step is 11.6 @xmath47 ( the efficiency @xmath50 ) . 
 the improvement obtained by a better spin down resolution is not so important , as can be seen from the figure . 
 it seems reasonable , given the observation that increasing the spin down resolution has a computational cost for both the methods , to use the nominal @xmath52 resolution ( x - axis equal to 1 in the figure ) .      to study the loss due to the sky grid resolution 
 , we have simulated 50 signals , randomly distributed over the sky . 
 we have then looked for results using the optimal grid , again registering the average value of all the detected peaks . in what follows , 
 we suppose to use the optimal grid for both the procedures , sky and frequency hough . 
 fig.[fig : loss_spinres ] shows the amplitude losses , as a function of the over resolution sky map factor @xmath39 , in the two cases of @xmath46 ( left ) , frequency hough , and @xmath49 ( right ) , sky hough . 
 the amplitude loss , for @xmath44 , is @xmath53 for the frequency hough , and @xmath54 , for the sky hough . 
 again , a better efficiency for the new procedure . 
 we notice that the use of an over resolution for the sky map , would have an impact on the computing cost , with both the procedures .    . 
 the figures compare the loss when @xmath46 ( left ) , frequency hough , and when @xmath55 ( right ) , sky hough.,title=""fig:"",width=302 ] . 
 the figures compare the loss when @xmath46 ( left ) , frequency hough , and when @xmath55 ( right ) , sky hough.,title=""fig:"",width=302 ]        + we see that the ratio of the amplitude efficiencies is @xmath57 which in power is 1.317 . from this 
 , we can compute the gain in computing cost for the same sensitivity . 
 let us firstly recall that the @xmath58 sensitivity in the hierarchical search is proportional to @xmath59 , and the computing cost to @xmath60 . 
 thus , the `` equivalent fft '' length factor is @xmath61=1.734 and the gain in computing cost is @xmath62=5.2 ( that is , the ratio of computing costs needed to have the same @xmath58 sensitivity ) .      * the * adaptivity * , that is the weight of peaks to consider the noise level and the gain due to the antenna pattern toward a direction , is , with this approach , immediate and very simple , as each hough map is done for a single sky position . 
 it has been shown , with the sky hough , that the adaptivity of the procedure is a very important task for the analysis ; * this new procedure is appropriate also for all those situations in which the * source position * is known and we should estimate only source frequency and spin down ; * with a proper choice of parameters , it is also possible to detect and hence remove * spurious signals * , with a constant or linearly varying frequency .    on the latter point , we are now working to study the efficiency of this method in terms of rejection of spurious lines in the peakmap . we know that this is a very critical task for the analysis , since the presence of spurious lines highly affects the sensitivity of the search . 
 we expect this new method to be much more insensitive to the presence of spurious lines , since in the chosen hough plane spurious lines and g.w . 
 signals should have a very different and well separable behavior .

6,"this review focuses specifically on what we have learned about the progenitors of core - collapse supernovae ( cc  sne ) by examining images of the supernova ( sn ) sites taken prior to the explosion . by registering pre - sn and post - sn images , usually taken at high resolution using either space - based optical detectors , or ground - based infrared detectors equipped with laser guide star adaptive optics systems ( lgs - ao ) , about one dozen cc sn progenitors have now been directly detected ( i.e. , shown to be spatially coincident with the sn ) in pre - sn images , with roughly two dozen upper limits derived from non - detections @xcite . 
 this field has come a long way in the last decade , and promises to advance rapidly as more and more nearby galaxies  hosts of future cc sne  have high - resolution images added to the archive . 
 this review is organized as follows . following a brief summary of sn classification and stellar evolution theory (   2 ) , one example from each of the following three categories of progenitor studies 
 is provided (   3 ; ordered from most - to - least common ) : ( 1 ) no progenitor star detected in pre - sn image(s ) ; ( 2 ) likely progenitor star identified via spatial coincidence in pre - sn and post - sn images ; ( 3 ) progenitor star detected in pre - sn image(s ) and subsequently confirmed by demonstrating its absence in images taken after the sn has faded beyond detection . a summary of overall results to date for each sn type 
 is then given (   4 ) , followed by a brief discussion of outstanding questions and areas in which future progress is likely (   5 ) . 
 note that discussion is limited to what the examination of images of sn sites taken prior to the explosion has taught us , and necessarily excludes ( or relegates to very brief comment ) such related investigations as sn environments ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also the article by elias rosa in this volume ) and sn progenitor `` forensics '' ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also the article by modjaz in this volume ) . for a comprehensive discussion of all such related areas , 
 see the recent review by @xcite . 
 it is typical to subdivide cc  sne into at least five major categories ( see @xcite for a thorough review ) : ii - plateau ( ii - p ; hydrogen in spectrum and plateau in optical light curve ) , ii - linear ( ii - l ; hydrogen in spectrum , no plateau in optical light curve ) , iin ( hydrogen in spectrum and spectral and photometric evidence for interaction between sn ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium [ csm ] ) , iib ( hydrogen in spectrum initially , but transforms into a hydrogen - deficient spectrum at later times ) , and ib / c ( no evidence for hydrogen in spectrum at any time ) , where the ordering is a roughly increasing one in terms of inferred degree of envelope stripping prior to explosion ( i.e. , ii - p are the least stripped at the time of explosion , and ib / c are the most stripped ) . 
 while most of this review focuses on the observational advances that have been made , theoretical input is critical to translate observed progenitor luminosity ( or limits ) into zero - age - main - sequence masses ( @xmath0 ) and stellar evolutionary states . among the most complete ( and accessiblestars . ] ) stellar evolution models at present are the metallicity - dependent models produced with the cambridge stellar evolution code , stars , the descendant of the code developed originally by @xcite and updated most recently by @xcite ( 2004 ; see also @xcite , and references therein ) , since they follow stellar evolution up to the initiation of core neon burning , which is likely to give an accurate indication of the pre - sn luminosity . 
 the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) of the stars evolutionary tracks are shown in figure  1 for stars ranging in initial mass from @xmath1 . 
 comparison with other contemporary model grids ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) show that the endpoints for stars in the @xmath2 range differ by at most @xmath3 dex in luminosity among the codes @xcite , which gives some assurance that systematic uncertainties are not great , at least at the low - mass end for red supergiant ( rsg ) stars . 
 two areas of uncertainty in need of better quantification ( or , at least , agreement within the community ) include the effects that stellar rotation and mass - loss might have on the observable characteristics of stars prior to core collapse . 
 not surprisingly , when no progenitor star is actually detected at the sn location in pre - sn images , only an upper limit to the progenitor s luminosity and , hence , mass , can be derived . to illustrate the analysis process in such a situation , i consider sn  2006my , an sn 
 ii - p that exploded in a galaxy @xmath4 mpc away ( nearly all sne with progenitor studies are within @xmath5 mpc , since source confusion becomes an increasing problem with distance ) . 
 details for this particular event are provided by @xcite ; here i briefly outline the steps my colleagues and i took to derive an upper mass limit on its progenitor .    the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) imaged the site of sn  2006my using the wide - field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in 1994 ( pre - sn ) and again in 2007 ( shortly after explosion ) . 
 we registered the two images and pinpointed the sn location to better than 30 milli - arcsec in the pre - sn frame ( figure 2a , b ) . 
 such fine registration allowed us to rule out a nearby point source ( source ` 1 ' in figure 2a ) as the progenitor star with greater than @xmath6 confidence . 
 ( note that this source had been previously identified by @xcite as the likely progenitor based on registration with lower - resolution ground - based optical post - sn images . ) 
 we next set an @xmath7-band detection limit in the pre - sn frame by placing artificial stars of progressively fainter magnitude at the sn location and letting the photometry software ( in this case , hstphot , see @xcite ) attempt to detect them . 
 the point at which the software no longer detected a point source then serves as the limiting upper magnitude for the progenitor star .    to translate this single - filter detection limit into a luminosity , we assumed that the progenitor was a rsg ( given other sn  ii - p progenitor detections this seems a reasonable assumption ; see  3.2 and  4 ) , and then determined the greatest bolometric magnitude it could have had while still remaining below our detection threshold . 
 this is accomplished through :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the distance modulus of the host galaxy ( ngc 4651 ) , @xmath10 the extinction to sn  2006my , @xmath7 the @xmath7-band detection threshold , @xmath11 the color range of rsg stars ( i.e. , spectral types @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 the bolometric correction corresponding to each @xmath14 . upon adopting the most conservative values for each of the parameters ( i.e. , the ones that produce the least restrictive @xmath15 for the progenitor s upper luminosity limit ) , and allowing for a maximum systematic uncertainty of 0.2 dex in the theoretical stellar model endpoints ( see   2 ) , the limiting bolometric magnitude above which any rsg would have been detected in our pre - sn image , @xmath15 , is derived . 
 we then compared this with the final luminosity of stars with @xmath16 predicted by the stars stellar evolution models ( figure 2c ) to derive an upper bound on the progenitor mass of @xmath17 . from this analysis , then , we conclude that any rsg progenitor with an initial mass greater than @xmath18 would have been detected using our analysis procedure .    analyses similar to that described here for sn  2006my have been carried out on each of 22 non - detections in pre - sn images @xcite . as we shall see (   4 ) , it is the sheer number of such progenitor non - detections that permits rather strong conclusions to be drawn about cc sn progenitors from this category of progenitor studies . 
 next , we consider the individually more revealing situation where an object coincident with the transformed sn location is actually detected in the pre - sn image(s ) , a situation that exists now for 11 cc sne @xcite . as an outstanding example of the analytic power provided by having multi - filter pre - sn images available ( especially in the near infrared for rsg progenitors ) , we consider the recent work of @xcite on sn  2008bk , a very nearby ( @xmath19 mpc ) sn  ii - p . in this case , 
 pre - sn ground - based images in @xmath20 were registered with post - sn lgs - ao @xmath21-band images to yield solid progenitor star detections in @xmath22 , and upper luminosity limits in @xmath23 and @xmath24 . when compared with the known spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of rsg , a good match for the progenitor of sn  2008bk 
 is found with a progenitor of spectral type m4i ( figure  3 ) . from comparison with the stars stellar evolutionary models an initial progenitor mass of @xmath25 
 is derived for this sn . 
 similar studies on seven other detected sn  ii - p progenitors have found stars consistent with rsg in all cases , providing nice agreement between theory and observation . as we shall see in   4 , however , the _ range _ of masses inferred for these rsg progenitors is somewhat unexpected . 
 finally , we consider the most satisfying situation where images taken before , during , and long after the sn explosion exist that clearly show the progenitor star , the sn , and the absence of the progenitor star , respectively . 
 such a sequence provides nearly conclusive proof of the progenitor star s identity . 
 currently , such a time series exists for only two objects : sn  1987a ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ) and sn  2005gl @xcite . 
 because the case of sn  1987a is well - known , i present sn  2005gl as the example of this situation ; it also clearly demonstrates the investigative power provided by having a third observation , long after the sn has dropped below detection . 
 as shown by @xcite , early spectra of sn  2005gl exhibited the classic features of a type iin event , showing narrow but resolved lines of hydrogen superposed on an intermediate - width component on an otherwise featureless continuum . 
 analysis of the spectral features indicate ejecta interacting with a dense csm , whose properties suggest that the progenitor star exploded shortly after an lbv - like mass - loss episode . comparison of a pre - sn _ hst _ image with a post - sn image obtained from the ground using the lgs - ao at the keck ii telescope established a spatial coincidence between the sn and a very bright source possessing an estimated luminosity of over @xmath26 ( @xcite ; see figures  4a and 4b ) . 
 the only single stars known to possess such an extraordinary luminosity are very massive ( @xmath27 ; see figure  1 ) , which conventional theory predicts should explode only after the lbv phase has ended @xcite . 
 initially , strong claims for the unexpectedly luminous progenitor / sn  2005gl association had to be tempered by consideration of the distance of sn  2005gl s host galaxy . at over 60 mpc away , the @xmath28 resolution of the pre - sn _ hst _ image corresponds to @xmath5 pc , which raises suspicion that the object could be , e.g. , an unresolved stellar cluster or association of several massive stars , with only part of the light coming from the actual progenitor of sn  2005gl @xcite . 
 additional observations , therefore , were clearly needed to settle the case , and two years later , an additional _ hst _ observation was made . 
 this observation demonstrates that the luminous source in the pre - sn image has , indeed , disappeared ( figure  4c ) , which implies that the progenitor of sn  2005gl was a single , extremely luminous , star that exploded while in the lbv phase @xcite . 
 such a luminosity is indicative of having had an initial mass of @xmath29 , which likely left behind a stellar mass black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 in addition to exploding during an unexpected evolutionary phase , the very fact _ that _ such a massive star is demonstrated to have exploded at all  as opposed to directly collapsing to a black hole with no sn explosion  is important , since the optical signature produced at the time of stellar collapse to a black hole is , at present , virtually unconstrained by either observation or theory ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . 
 the three examples discussed in   3 serve to illustrate how the science of seeking progenitors in pre - sn images is carried out , and what conclusions can typically be drawn . 
 i now briefly summarize results to date arising from direct progenitor searches in pre - sn images ; for a more comprehensive review , see @xcite . 
 * type ii - plateau : * sne  ii - p are by far the most well - defined category of cc sne in terms of direct observational progenitor constraints , having had eight putative progenitor detections made and 12 upper luminosity limits established . 
 all of the available evidence suggests that rsg are the immediate progenitors of sne  ii - p . by employing a uniform reduction and analysis procedure , 
 @xcite has produced the cumulative frequency distribution shown in figure  5 for sne  ii - p , from which an intriguing result is immediately evident : all but one of the sne  ii - p have initial masses constrained to be @xmath30 , with the most massive _ detected _ progenitor of an sn  ii - p having a mass of only @xmath31 . 
 this is surprising , since rsg up to @xmath32 are clearly observed in the local group ( * ? ? ? 
 * and references therein ) , and would have easily been detected in the pre - sn images . 
 this lack of massive rsg progenitors for sne ii - p lead @xcite to speculate that these massive rsg progenitors may be forming black holes heralded by faint , or non - existent , sn explosions ( see also * ? ? ? 
 * type ii - linear : * a rare type of cc sn , it is perhaps not surprising that only one sn  ii - l ( sn  1980k ) has a pre - sn image , the analysis of which rules out massive rsg greater than about @xmath33 @xcite . 
 analysis of the stellar population of the type ii - l sn  1979c by @xcite determines a mass range of @xmath34 for its progenitor . at this point , 
 firm conclusions about the progenitors of sne  ii - l can not be made , although early indications are that at least some do not arise from extremely massive stars . 
 * type iin : * sn  2005gl , described earlier in this review (   3.3 ) as having a very massive ( @xmath27 ) progenitor that exploded while in the lbv phase , is the only example of an sn  iin for which a progenitor has been detected in pre - sn images . 
 whether such a massive progenitor is indicative of the class as a whole is not known . 
 * type iib : * pre - sn images exist for two events . 
 first , sn  1993j in m81 , where extensive analyses of pre - sn and post - sn images ( and spectra ) lead to the conclusion that a @xmath35 star exploded in a binary system , with a slightly less massive secondary surviving the explosion ( * ? ? ? 
 * and references therein ) . 
 very recently , the type iib sn  2008ax has provided a great opportunity to further investigate this rare class of cc sne since pre - sn _ 
 hst_/wfpc2 images exist in @xmath36 . 
 a study by @xcite finds a curiously flat sed for the progenitor star , which is impossible to reconcile with a single rsg , but may be consistent with an early - type w - r ( wn class ) progenitor , suggesting a progenitor star with a large ( @xmath37 ) initial mass . 
 * type ib / c : * a well - studied class , with ten upper limits but no detections from analysis of pre - sn images . 
 the lack of detections is surprising , since it is commonly thought that at least some of the progenitors of sne  ib / c should be luminous , single w - r stars , in addition to others perhaps arising from lower mass stars in binary systems . while none of the non - detections definitively rule out a w - r progenitor 
 , @xcite demonstrates that it is quite unlikely at this point that all sne  ib / c come from them . 
 a summary of the current state of affairs of cc sn progenitor research via studies of pre - sn images is provided by figure  6 . 
 the science of seeking sn progenitors has made tremendous strides in just the last ten years . for the future , 
 i look with particular interest at the extremes as areas ripe for breakthrough discoveries , since it is there that many of our most fundamental questions lie . on the low - mass end , how will the lack of massive rsg progenitors for sne  ii - p be resolved ? 
 are we seeing the first glimpse of the mass cutoff for direct collapse to black holes ? 
 if so , then how will this be reconciled with the _ very _ massive stars ( i.e. , the other mass extreme ) that apparently do explode as sne  iin or possibly iib ? and finally , how does binarity influence all of these conclusions ? 
 clearly , we are just at the beginning stages of this exciting field of research , and great advances will no doubt be made in the coming decade .

7,"single - transverse spin asymmetries ( ssas ) play a fundamental role for our understanding of qcd in high - energy hadronic scattering . 
 they may be obtained for reactions in , for example , lepton - proton or proton - proton scattering with one transversely polarized initial proton , by dividing the difference of the cross sections for the two settings of the transverse polarization by their sum . 
 there have been extensive experimental investigations of such asymmetries  @xcite . 
 these have initiated much theoretical progress , in particular within the last few years . 
 a particular focus has been on a class of single - spin observables that are characterized by a large momentum scale @xmath1 ( for example , the virtuality of the photon in deeply - inelastic scattering ( dis ) ) and by a much smaller , but also measured , transverse momentum @xmath2 . 
 in such a `` two - scale '' situation , single - spin asymmetries may arise at leading power , that is , not suppressed by an inverse power of @xmath1 . for some of these cases , 
 factorization theorems have been established  @xcite that allow to write the spin - dependent cross sections in terms of parton distribution functions and/or fragmentation functions , perturbative hard - scattering functions , and so - called soft factors . 
 a crucial feature is that the distribution functions and the soft factor in this factorization are not integrated over the transverse momenta of partons , because these in fact generate the observed transverse momentum @xmath2 . among other things 
 , the observables may therefore provide valuable insights into the dependence of parton distributions in nucleons on transverse momentum . 
 this becomes particularly interesting when the nucleon is transversely polarized , because there may be correlations between the nucleon spin vector , its momentum , and the parton s transverse momentum . 
 one particular correlation , known as the `` sivers effect '' and described by so - called `` sivers functions ''  @xcite , is now widely believed to be involved in a variety of observed hadronic single - spin phenomena . 
 closer theoretical studies have revealed that the sivers effect plays an important role in qcd , beyond giving rise to phenomenological functions to be used in the description of single - spin asymmetries . 
 a particularly interesting feature is that the sivers effect is not universal in the usual sense , that is , it is not represented by universal probability functions convoluted with partonic hard - scattering cross sections . 
 this might at first sight appear to make the study of these functions less interesting . 
 however , the non - universality has in fact a clear physical origin , and its closer investigation has turned out to be an extremely important and productive development in qcd . in a nutshell , in order not to be forced to vanish because of the time - reversal symmetry of qcd , single - spin asymmetries require the presence of a strong - interaction phase . for the sivers functions this phase originates from the `` gauge links '' in their definition  @xcite , which are path - ordered exponentials of the gluon field that make the functions gauge - invariant . in dis 
 , the gauge link may be viewed as a rescattering of the parton in the color field of the nucleon remnant . that such a final - state rescattering may generate the phase required for a nonzero ssa in semi - inclusive hadron production in dis ( sidis ) was first discovered within a model calculation  @xcite . 
 depending on the hard - scattering process , the `` rescattering '' will however manifest itself in different ways . 
 for example , for drell - yan lepton pair production in hadronic scattering , _ initial - state _ , rather than final - state , interactions are relevant . as a result , the phase provided by the gauge links is opposite , and the sivers functions for the drell - yan process have opposite sign  @xcite . in more general terms , 
 the nontrivial  universality "" property of the sivers functions is the direct consequence of gauge interactions in quantum chromodynamics  @xcite , and of the qcd factorization theorems applying to the relevant hard processes  @xcite . 
 it is a remarkable and fundamental qcd prediction that really tests all concepts we know of for analyzing hard - scattering reactions in strong interactions , and it awaits experimental verification .    while measurements of ssas in sidis are now maturing and have established the presence of sivers - type contributions  @xcite , it will still be a while until precise single - spin measurements in the relatively rare drell - yan process will become feasible at rhic  @xcite or elsewhere  @xcite . however , there are of course other hard - scattering reactions in hadronic collisions for which single - transverse spin asymmetries may be defined , and that may potentially be used in lieu of the drell - yan process for testing the nontrivial 
 universality "" properties of the sivers functions . in @xcite , it was proposed to use the ssa in azimuthal correlations of two jets produced in @xmath0 collisions at rhic to learn about the sivers functions . to a first approximation , 
 such dijets are produced by @xmath3 partonic qcd hard - scattering . 
 with collinear kinematics , the jets are exactly `` back - to - back '' in the plane perpendicular to the initial beam directions and thus separated by @xmath4 in azimuthal angle in this plane . 
 partonic transverse momenta will generate deviations from this topology , because they will lead on average to a non - vanishing net transverse momentum @xmath2 of the jet pair , much smaller than each of the jet transverse momenta @xmath5 individually . 
 the observable is therefore of the `` two - scale '' type described above , and as was shown in @xcite , if one proton is polarized , a single - spin asymmetry may be defined that is in principle sensitive to the sivers functions . as 
 a caveat , factorization of the spin - dependent cross section for this observable in terms of transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) functions still remains to be established .    unlike the relatively simple cases of sidis and the drell - yan process , where either final - state or initial - state interactions contribute to the sivers asymmetry , both are present for dijet production @xcite 
 this complicates the analysis of the process - dependence of the sivers functions considerably , but at the same time it also makes it much more interesting from a theoretical point of view , because the interactions in this case are `` truly qcd '' , that is , they involve the detailed gauge structure of the theory , including for example its non - abelian nature . at the time of @xcite , 
 the process - dependence had not yet been worked out for the case of the ssa in dijet production , so that phenomenological predictions had to remain qualitative , at best . over the last year 
 , however , there has been extensive work on deriving and clarifying the structure of the gauge links for this and related processes in @xmath0 collisions @xcite . 
 indeed , the resulting structure is far more complicated than that in sidis or the drell - yan process . 
 however , it turns out that if one takes a certain weighted integral ( `` moment '' ) of the asymmetry , remarkable simplifications occur . 
 this moment is defined by integrating the spin - dependent cross section with a factor @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the azimuthal imbalance between the two jets ( @xmath8 if the jets are exactly back - to - back in azimuth ) . for each of the various contributing @xmath3 partonic channels , 
 the gauge link then essentially collapses into a set of simple color factors that multiply contributions from color - gauge invariant subamplitudes to the given partonic process . 
 one may , in fact , for convenience choose to absorb these factors into the hard - scattering functions , and _ define _ the sivers functions as the functions measured in the ssa in sidis . in this way , the net effect of the gauge links on the @xmath6-moment of the spin - dependent cross section is to generate new partonic hard - scattering functions that are different from the usual spin - independent ones , but that are actually similarly simple in structure .    at the same time , taking the moment of the factorized spin - dependent cross section leads to a new expression that involves only a certain moment of the sivers functions in partonic transverse momentum @xmath9 , rather than the fully transverse - momentum dependent functions themselves . as was shown in  @xcite , these @xmath9-moments of the sivers functions are directly related to twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions first introduced in  @xcite to describe the ssa for single - inclusive hadron production in hadronic scattering . by now , quite some knowledge about these correlation functions has been gathered from phenomenological studies  @xcite of the corresponding data . 
 the upshot of all this is that it has now become possible for the first time to make predictions for the @xmath6-moment of the single - transverse spin asymmetry in dijet production at rhic that correctly take into account the process - dependence of the sivers functions and incorporate phenomenological information on some properties of the functions that is available from other measurements . 
 this is the goal of this note . 
 we study azimuthal correlations of two jets produced nearly `` back - to - back '' in a hadronic collision . 
 more specifically , we are interested in situations in which the sum of the two jet transverse momenta , @xmath10 ( or a component or projection thereof ) , is measured and small , while both individual jet transverse momenta are large and similar . 
 we will therefore approximate @xmath11 wherever possible . 
 for the lengths of these momentum vectors we will simply write @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the differential cross section for the process with one transversely polarized hadron contains terms of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a unit vector in the direction of the polarized proton 
 , @xmath16 is the transverse spin vector of the polarized proton , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the pseudo - rapidities of the two jets . 
 the first term in eq . 
 ( [ sigma ] ) represents the unpolarized ( or spin - averaged ) cross section , while the second term is the single - transverse - spin dependent one . 
 we note that the angular dependence of the spin - dependent term is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the so - called bisector - angle of the two jets , which ( approximately ) corresponds to the direction of @xmath21 . for this reason one may also choose to integrate the six - fold differential cross section in eq . 
 ( [ sigma ] ) over @xmath22 , keeping @xmath21 fixed .    as a generalization of the sidis and drell - yan cases @xcite , we can write down a factorization formula for the differential cross section at small imbalance ( @xmath23 ) of the jets , in terms of tmd parton distributions , soft factors , and hard - scattering functions  @xcite . 
 we remind the reader that such a factorization still remains to be proven . in this paper 
 , we will not discuss the details of factorization issues related to the dijet correlations . as we mentioned above 
 , significant simplifications occur when the imbalance of the two jets is integrated out by taking certain moments . 
 for example , integrating the spin - independent differential cross section over all @xmath21 , its expression reverts to the standard collinear factorization formula for dijet production , @xmath24 where the @xmath25 denote the usual collinear ( light - cone ) parton distribution functions for parton type @xmath26 . 
 we have assumed here that these are recovered by integration of the corresponding tmd distribution functions over all partonic transverse momentum , and we disregard the renormalization properties of the operators defining these distributions and the scale dependence introduced by renormalization . 
 however , all these effects can be systematically included accordingly . 
 the factors @xmath27 in eq . 
 ( [ jeteq ] ) are the customary hard - scattering cross sections @xmath28 for the partonic processes @xmath29 ( for a compilation , see , for example , ref . 
 they are functions of the partonic mandelstam variables , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , with obvious notation of the parton momenta . in terms of the hadronic center - of - mass energy @xmath33 and the jet transverse momenta and pseudo - rapidities 
 , one has @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where the partonic momentum fractions are fixed by @xmath37 , @xmath38 . 
 next we turn to the single - transverse - spin dependent differential cross section @xmath39 in eq . 
 ( [ sigma ] ) , which can be further simplified by taking a moment in @xmath40 where @xmath41 measures how far the two jets are away from the back - to - back configuration . within our approximations 
 , the weight @xmath42 corresponds to a weight in @xmath2 . 
 one finds  @xcite : @xmath43 & = & \vert \vec s_\perp\vert   \sum_{ab } x_a\,\frac{-1}{m_p}\,gt_{f\,a}(x_a)\,x_bf_b(x_b ) \,h_{ab\to cd}^{\rm sivers}(\hat{s},\hat{t},\hat{u})\ , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the proton mass , @xmath45 is the strong coupling constant and the @xmath46 are the qiu - sterman matrix elements or quark - gluon correlation functions @xcite , defined as @xmath47 with the quark fields @xmath48 ( for flavor @xmath49 ) and the gluon field strength tensor @xmath50 . 
 the @xmath46 matrix elements enter because they are related to the @xmath9-moment of the ( sidis ) sivers function for quark flavor @xmath49 @xcite , that is , @xmath51 . 
 we note that there could also be contributions by purely gluonic `` @xmath52 '' correlation functions . 
 these will be ignored for now , so that the label @xmath49 in eq . 
 ( [ qtmp ] ) runs only over quarks and anti - quarks . 
 furthermore , there is actually a second contribution to the single - transverse - spin dependent cross section , which involves the scattering of transversely polarized quarks from both the polarized proton ( transversity distribution , @xmath53 or @xmath54 ) and from the unpolarized proton ( boer - mulders function @xmath55  @xcite ) . 
 the latter functions are also effects of initial- and final - state interactions and appear in a matrix element for unpolarized protons similar to eq .  . 
 like the sivers - type `` @xmath52 '' correlation functions , we will also ignore the contributions associated with the boer - mulders functions in the present study , even though a future more detailed analysis of forthcoming experimental data may well require to take all of these into account . 
 we now use the above formulas to obtain some predictions for the ssa in dijet - production at rhic . 
 a ssa for our @xmath59-moment ( i.e. @xmath60-moment ) can be defined as ( from now on we choose @xmath61 ) @xmath62 the quark - gluon correlation functions @xmath63 have recently been fitted  @xcite to data  @xcite for the ssa in single - inclusive hadron production in hadronic collisions . 
 two sets of @xmath63 were presented in  @xcite . for definiteness , 
 we choose set  i , which is a two - flavor fit with valence @xmath64 and @xmath65-quark @xmath66 distributions only . 
 for these the following parameterizations were obtained in  @xcite : @xmath67 where the @xmath68 are the corresponding unpolarized valence quark distributions . for the latter , as for all other unpolarized parton distributions we need , 
 we choose the cteq5l parameterizations @xcite . 
 we plot the resulting weighted asymmetry in fig . 
 the kinematics are chosen to correspond to current measurements at star : both jets have transverse momenta @xmath69 and pseudo - rapidities @xmath70 . 
 the asymmetry is plotted as a function of the sum of the two jet pseudo - rapidities . 
 we have chosen the hard scale @xmath71 in the strong coupling constant and the unpolarized parton distributions .    for comparison , we also show in fig . 
 [ fig1 ] the asymmetries that one would have expected if the sivers functions relevant for dijet production were identical to the ones in sidis or the drell - yan process . in the framework of our present calculation , 
 the corresponding partonic hard - scattering functions would in this case be identical to the spin - averaged functions @xmath72 , or to their negatives . 
 the dotted - dashed lines in the right panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] represent these cases . 
 they essentially correspond to the earlier predictions of  @xcite and  @xcite that were made when the process - dependence of the sivers functions had not yet been worked out for the dijet case . 
 one can see that when the correct process - dependence is incorporated , the asymmetry overall becomes smaller by about a factor two , which can be traced back to the color factors for the dominant subprocess @xmath73 . 
 the sign is identical to the case when the sivers functions for dijet production are assumed to be `` dis - like '' , implying that in a sense final - state interactions dominate over initial - state ones .    in principle 
 , one might verify experimentally the process - dependence of the sivers functions by discriminating between the various curves in fig . 
 [ fig1 ] and confirming the qcd - predicted result shown by the solid line . in practice 
 , this may require good knowledge of the @xmath66 distributions , and an understanding of issues like scale evolution and higher - order corrections . 
 a closer analysis reveals that the asymmetry in fig . 
 [ fig1 ] is the result of rather significant cancellations between contributions of opposite signs by @xmath64 and @xmath65 quarks . to show this 
 , we display their individual contributions separately in the left panel of fig . 
 [ fig1 ] .    -0.4 
 cm    we finally also briefly discuss a related type of ssa in dijet production at rhic . in @xcite , 
 a differently weighted ssa was considered , defined in the following way : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the sign function . 
 this asymmetry has the property that the weight only depends on the azimuthal separation of the two jets , but not on their transverse momenta . 
 this may be an advantage for experimental measurements when the jet energy scale is not precisely known . when applied to the tmd factorized expression for the spin - dependent cross section , the moment defined in eq . 
 ( [ sign ] ) leads to an expression different from  ( [ qtmp ] ) . 
 one finds in fact that in general the transverse - momentum dependences of the various functions do not completely decouple anymore , so that the final result can in general no longer be expressed in terms of only functions of light - cone momentum fractions . 
 if one assumes for simplicity  @xcite , however , that the only relevant dependence on transverse momentum resides in the sivers functions , the resulting expression again resembles a collinearly - factorized one : @xmath76 where the @xmath77 are the so - called `` @xmath78-moments '' of the sivers functions for sidis and are defined as @xmath79 in the above equations , we have used the notation `` @xmath80 '' for the sivers function for quark flavor @xmath49 ; its definition is identical to that in @xcite : @xmath81 . in  @xcite 
 , the hard - scattering functions were chosen to be the same as the spin - averaged ones , with opposite sign . in light of the above discussions , 
 one now would like to update the predictions for the asymmetry in  ( [ eqan ] ) . 
 we will use the @xmath56 given in eqs . 
 ( [ hsivers ] ) . 
 we note that it remains to be established that the same @xmath56 do contribute in this case . 
 this is not a priori clear , because the general gauge link structure is very complex in the general tmd case , and it has so far only been demonstrated that the @xmath56 apply when the @xmath6 moment is taken . for 
 now , we just conjecture that use of the @xmath56 of  @xcite is justified in this case ; a closer discussion of this issue is left for future work  @xcite . 
 the 1/2-moments of the quark sivers functions were determined in  @xcite by a fit to the hermes data  @xcite for the sivers - type single - spin asymmetry : @xmath82 these results correspond to set  ii presented in  @xcite . in fig . 
 [ fig2 ] , we show predictions for the asymmetry for the dijet - correlation defined in  ( [ eqan ] ) at rhic , based on this parameterization . we find that the asymmetry shares many features with the one shown for the @xmath59-moment in fig . 
 we note that first preliminary experimental data for this asymmetry have now been presented by star  @xcite , which are so far consistent with a vanishing asymmetry .    -0.4 
 in summary , we have studied single - transverse spin asymmetries in dijet - correlations at rhic , making use of the recently derived partonic hard - scattering cross sections that properly incorporate the initial- and final - state interactions , and of distribution functions fitted to existing data for single - spin asymmetries . 
 we have found that the initial- and final - state interactions tend to decrease the magnitude of the asymmetry at rhic with respect to earlier estimates that assumed the sivers functions for this observable to be identical to the sivers functions in sidis or the drell - yan process . 
 overall , the resulting asymmetries turn out to be more dominated by the final - state interactions , and hence more `` dis - like '' .    with experimental data on dijet single - spin asymmetries now forthcoming , it will be interesting to perform detailed comparisons with the theoretical expectations . 
 other observables , such as the ssas in dihadron production @xmath83 or in photon - plus - jet production @xmath84 , will also be extremely interesting 
 . it will be important to further develop the theoretical framework for all these observables , by addressing issues like tmd factorization , higher orders , soft factors , and sudakov suppression , in particular .

8,"kingman s coalescent is a random tree introduced by @xcite as the genealogy arising in large population genetic models . 
 it has infinitely many leaves and is usually constructed from leaves to the root as follows : given that there are @xmath7 lines in the tree , after some exponential time with rate @xmath8 , two lines are chosen uniformly and merged to one line , leaving the tree with @xmath9 lines . due to the quadratic rate @xmath10 the tree immediately comes down from infinitely to finitely many leaves @xcite . since the seminal paper by @xcite this random tree has been generalized to other infinite trees arising in population genetics models .    for the kingman 
 coalescent some laws of large numbers and central limit theorems have been proved . 
 they are nicely summarized in @xcite , chapter  4.2 ; see also proposition  [ p:11 ] below . for @xmath11 
 let @xmath12 denote the number of lines time @xmath13 in the past . 
 then , since the kingman coalescent immediately comes down from infinity , @xmath12 is finite . 
 furthermore it is approximately @xmath14 . 
 equivalently , the time @xmath0 it takes the coalescent to go from infinitely many lines to @xmath1 lines is approximately @xmath15 for large @xmath1 . 
 going to the fine structure , at time @xmath0 the infinite population is decomposed in @xmath1 families ( whose joint distribution is exchangeable ) and every leaf in the tree belongs to exactly one of the @xmath1 families whose frequencies are denoted by @xmath16 . 
 it is known that for large @xmath1 a randomly chosen @xmath3 is approximately exponentially distributed with mean @xmath17 . 
 this translates into several laws of large numbers ; see e.g.  ( 35 ) in @xcite . 
 in particular the probability of picking ( from the initial infinite population ) two leaves that belong to the same family , given by @xmath18 , is approximately @xmath15 .    the main goal of the present paper is to study the corresponding large deviations results . to the best of our knowledge , except for @xcite , cf . 
 remark  [ rem : angel ] , results in this direction are not present in the literature . 
 we formulate our results in the next section . 
 theorem  [ t1 ] gives a full large deviation principle for the distributions of @xmath19 . 
 the proof , given in section  [ sec : proofs1 ] , is an application of the grtner - ellis theorem . as a byproduct 
 , we derive a large deviation principle for the distributions of @xmath20 in corollary  [ cor : tnt ] . 
 large deviations of @xmath21 are considered in theorem  [ t2 ] and exact rate functions for downwards and upwards deviations are given . the proof is given in section  [ sec : proof - theorem - reft2 ] . for the upward deviations we use a variant of cramr s theorem for heavy - tailed random variables 
 ; see e.g.  @xcite . for the downward deviations we use a connection to self - normalized large deviations ; see @xcite . 
 this connection was pointed out to us by alain rouault and nina gantert . 
 since the rate function for downward deviations is hard to treat analytically we provide in theorem  [ t3 ] a simple lower bound . 
 the proof of that bound is given in section  [ sec : proof - theorem3 ] . 
 the kingman coalescent can be seen as a discrete graph , more precisely a discrete tree with infinitely many leaves . 
 let @xmath22 be independent exponentially distributed variables with mean @xmath23 . 
 then the kingman coalescent tree can be constructed from the root to the leaves as follows .    1 . 
 start the tree with two lines from the root . 
 2 .   for @xmath24 
 the tree stays with @xmath7 lines for the amount of time @xmath25 . 
 after that time one of the @xmath7 lines is randomly chosen . 
 this line splits in two so that the number of lines jumps from @xmath7 to @xmath26 . 
 3 .   stop upon reaching infinitely many lines , which happens after ( the almost surely finite ) time @xmath27 . 
 the random variable @xmath28 is the total tree height . 
 alternatively , @xmath28 is the time to the most recent common ancestor ( mrca ) of the infinite population ( of leaves ) . counted from the top of the tree at time @xmath29 a random number @xmath12 of active lines in the kingman tree is present , i.e.@xmath30 at time @xmath0 every leaf belongs to one of @xmath1 disjoint families and all members of each such family stem from the same line at time @xmath0 . 
 let us denote the frequencies of these families ( which exist due to exchangeability by definetti s theorem ) by @xmath16 . 
 the following results are well known ( see @xcite for   and and @xcite for ; proofs can also be found in @xcite . )     + let [ p:11 ] @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 be as above . 
 then @xmath34    we [ rem : interllnfe ] note that the left hand side of has the interpretation of a _ 
 homozygosity by descent _ in the following sense : when picking two leaves from the tree at time @xmath35 , the probability that both share a common ancestor at time @xmath0 is @xmath36 . 
 then , the law of large number states that the homozygosity by descent at time @xmath0 is approximately @xmath15 for large @xmath1 .    in the present paper 
 we are interested in large deviations results corresponding to the statements of proposition  [ p:11 ] . 
 we start with large deviations connected with . 
 first we introduce some notation . for @xmath37 let @xmath38 denote the distribution of @xmath19 , 
 i.e.  @xmath39 . 
 furthermore we denote by @xmath40 the borel @xmath41-algebra on @xmath42 and for @xmath43 we denote by @xmath44 the _ interior _ and by @xmath45 the _ closure _ of @xmath46 . for @xmath47 , 
 let @xmath48 be the unique solution of the equation @xmath49 , where the continuous and increasing function @xmath50 is defined by ( see figure  [ fig : t1 ] for a plot ) @xmath51      2 & : \ ; t=0 , \\[2ex ]      \displaystyle\frac{2}{\sqrt{|t|}}\arctan\sqrt{|t| } & : \ ; t < 0 . 
 \end{cases}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the proof of the following theorem is given in section  [ sec : proof - theorem - reft1 ] .    the sequence [ t1 ] @xmath52 satisfies a large deviation principle with scale @xmath1 and good rate function @xmath53 given by @xmath54        \infty & : \ 
 ; x\leq 0 . 
 \end{cases }    \end{aligned}\ ] ] in other words , for any @xmath55 we have @xmath56     and @xmath53 from and , respectively.,title=""fig:"",width=226 ]   and @xmath53 from and , respectively.,title=""fig:"",width=226 ]    both , the function @xmath57 from and @xmath53 from are plotted in figure  [ fig : t1 ] . 
 the minimum of the rate function is attained at @xmath58 . 
 this fact is clear from the law of large numbers , . 
 in addition , @xmath59 for @xmath60 because @xmath61 almost surely . 
 let us now have a closer look at the behaviour of @xmath62 for @xmath63 near @xmath35 and for large @xmath63 . 
 since @xmath64 , we have that @xmath65 , and hence , @xmath66 . in this case , @xmath67 where the last equality follows from @xmath68 . 
 to understand the behaviour for large @xmath63 , note that since @xmath69 for @xmath70 we have @xmath71 and in particular @xmath72 . 
 it follows @xmath73    note that and are equivalent . 
 indeed , @xmath74 ( this also holds with @xmath75 replaced by @xmath76 ) by construction , and @xmath77 as @xmath78 and @xmath79 as @xmath80 . 
 hence , theorem  [ t1 ] translates into a large deviation principle for @xmath20 . in the following 
 we denote by @xmath81 the distribution of @xmath82 , i.e.  @xmath83 . 
 the proof of the next result is given in section  [ sec : proof - coroll - refc ] ; see figure  [ fig : cor1 ] for a plot of the rate function @xmath84 .    for @xmath85 
 the family @xmath86 [ cor : tnt ] satisfies a large deviation principle with scale @xmath87 and good rate function @xmath84 given by @xmath88 \displaystyle        \frac{\pi^2}{2 } & : \ ,   x=0 , \\[1.5ex ]        \infty & : \ , x<0 ,      \end{cases }    \end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath53 from  . 
 in particular , for @xmath89 we have @xmath90     from corollary  [ cor : tnt ] . 
 the figure on the right is a comparison of @xmath84 with the lower bound obtained from @xcite.,title=""fig:"",width=226 ]   from corollary  [ cor : tnt ] . 
 the figure on the right is a comparison of @xmath84 with the lower bound obtained from @xcite.,title=""fig:"",width=226 ]    the distributions @xmath91 ( as well as @xmath92 ) have been described explicitely in the literature . 
 @xcite , section 6 , gives @xmath93 in principle , this formula must also give the large deviations for the measures @xmath81 , but this does not seem straight - forward .    although [ rem : angel ] the main goal of  @xcite was the analysis of spatial @xmath94-coalescents , they also provide some large deviations bounds on kingman s coalescent . 
 these bounds are mainly based on markov inequality . 
 precisely , in lemma 2.2 in @xcite it is shown that for @xmath95 @xmath96 and therefore @xmath97 in the neighbourhood of @xmath98 the last inequality translates easily into a bound for the rate function @xmath84 from ; see figure  [ fig : cor1 ] . 
 namely , for @xmath99 we have @xmath100    next , we state some large deviations results connected to  . for @xmath101 we know from   that @xmath102 holds almost surely . 
 the proof of this result is based on the well - known fact ( see e.g.  section  5 in @xcite ) that the distribution of @xmath103 can be derived using uniform order statistics : let @xmath104 be independent and uniformly distributed on @xmath105 $ ] , and @xmath106 be their order statistics . 
 additionally , let @xmath107 be independent exponentially distributed random variables with mean @xmath23 . then , @xmath108 here the second equality in distribution is one of the well known representations of uniform spacings ; see e.g.  section  4.1 in @xcite . 
 it follows @xmath109 we will use this representation to obtain large deviations results for @xmath103 . in particular 
 we show that upwards large deviations of @xmath103 are on the scale @xmath6 while downwards large deviations are on the scale @xmath1 . the proof is given in section  [ sec : proof - theorem - reft2 ] .    for [ t2 ] 
 each @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 furthermore @xmath112 and for each @xmath113 , we have @xmath114 the function @xmath115 is positive for @xmath116 and is given by @xmath117 here @xmath118 is a function of the form @xmath119 with @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the distribution function of the one dimensional standard gaussian distribution . 
 though the rate function in   is exact it is hard to treat analytically . for this reason we provide in theorem  [ t3 ] a much simpler lower bound for downwards large deviations of @xmath103 . for the proof we use the following lemma which provides another representation of @xmath103 in terms of exponential random variables ( see section  [ sec : proofs2 ] for proofs ) . 
 let [ l : wn ] @xmath122 be independent exponentially distributed random variables with mean @xmath23 . 
 then , @xmath123    for [ t3 ] @xmath124 we have @xmath125    the main point in the proof of lemma  [ l : wn ] is that @xmath103 does not depend on the order of the @xmath126 and hence we can as well order them according to their size . 
 let us briefly explain how we will use in the proof of in . since @xmath103 is minimal if @xmath127 ( whence @xmath128 ) , we have to look for possibilities that all @xmath126 s are of about the same size in order to obtain a large deviations result for @xmath103 . 
 let @xmath129 denote the above exponential random variables ordered in increasing order , i.e.  @xmath130 is the @xmath4th smallest value . 
 using `` competing exponential clocks '' arguments ( see also the proof of the lemma ) one can see that @xmath131 is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath132 . hence , one way of obtaining similar values for all @xmath126 s arises if @xmath133 is particularly large , which then leads to a large deviations result for @xmath103 .     from in theorem  [ t2 ] and the lower bound from in theorem  [ t3].,width=226 ]    \1 . 
 let us give some heuristics about the rates arising in theorem  [ t2 ] . for , we have to ask ourselves about the easiest way @xmath103 
 becomes too large . from 
 , we see that this is the case if one of the @xmath126 s is too large , making this kind of deviations a local property in the sense that only a single of the @xmath126 s has to show some untypical behavior . 
 this is different when looking at , i.e.  too small values of @xmath103 . 
 first , observe that @xmath103 is small only if all ( or many ) families have about equal sizes ( extreme case @xmath134 gives the minimal value @xmath128 ) . 
 hence , such downward deviations require to study a global property of the random variable @xmath103 , which is significantly harder . 
 for the proof of we will interpret @xmath103 as a self - normalised sum and use from @xcite a result on large deviations result for such sums .    \2 . from 
 , we see that in fact @xmath103 is a function of uniform order statistics , which , for instance , have been studied in detail ( although no large deviations results were given ) in @xcite . 
 hence , theorem  [ t2 ] may as well be interpreted as a large deviations result for uniform order statistics .    \3 . 
 as stated in remark  [ rem : interllnfe ] , @xmath135 can be interpreted as homozygosity at time @xmath0 . using a poisson process along the tree with intensity @xmath136 , we can ask for the probability of picking two leaves from the tree which are not separated by a poisson mark , denoted by _ homozygosity in state _ , abbreviated by @xmath137 . this quantity is closely related to the poisson - dirichlet distribution and some large deviations ( in the limit of large @xmath138 ) 
 were derived in @xcite . 
 it is shown there in theorem  5.1 that @xmath139 and that @xmath140 for @xmath141 . however , a large deviation principle for the quantity @xmath142 ( noting that @xmath143 ) , which corresponds to the results from theorem  [ t2 ] , could not be obtained by @xcite . at least , it was shown that its scale can not be larger than @xmath144 . 
 the proof of theorem  [ t1 ] is an application of the grtner - ellis theorem ; see for instance section  2.3 in @xcite . 
 let @xmath145 $ ] and @xmath146 . to show that the sequence @xmath147 satisfies a large deviation principle with scale @xmath1 and a good rate function we need to check the following three conditions .    1 
 .   @xmath148 exists for all @xmath149 as a limit in @xmath150 . 
 furthermore @xmath151 is lower - semicontinuous , @xmath152 , where @xmath153 . 
 @xmath94 is differentiable on @xmath154 . 
 3 .   @xmath94 is _ steep _ , i.e.  @xmath155 whenever @xmath156 and @xmath157 .    then the good rate function is given by @xmath158    we proceed in three steps . 
 first , we compute @xmath159 . 
 second , we check the further assumptions of the grtner - ellis theorem and obtain @xmath53 as the fenchel - legendre transform of @xmath94 . in the third step , for the rate function @xmath53 from 
 we obtain its simplified form given in theorem  [ t1 ] . 
 the limit of @xmath160 : * we will show that @xmath161 for this , recall from that @xmath162 where @xmath163 is exponentially distributed with rate @xmath164 as well as independent of @xmath165 for all @xmath166 . 
 furthermore recall that the moment generating function of an exponentially distributed random variable @xmath167 with rate @xmath168 is given by @xmath169 =    \begin{cases }      \frac{\lambda}{\lambda - t } , & \text{if $ t<\lambda$},\\ \infty ,      & \text{if $ t\geq \lambda$. }    \end{cases}\end{aligned}\ ] ] hence , for each @xmath170 and @xmath171 we obtain by the monotone convergence theorem @xmath172    = \mathbf{e}\left[e^{t n^2 \sum_{k = n+1}^\infty s_k/\binom k2}\right ]    = \prod_{k = n+1}^\infty \mathbf{e}\left[e^{tn^2 s_k/\binom k 2}\right].\ ] ] we have to consider two cases @xmath173 and @xmath174 separately . 
 first suppose that @xmath175 . then there exists @xmath176 so that for all @xmath177 we have @xmath178 consequently , using , we obtain @xmath179 = \infty$ ] for each @xmath177 . 
 hence , @xmath180 and @xmath181 for @xmath1 large enough . 
 thus , we have @xmath182 now suppose that @xmath183 . for @xmath184 and @xmath185 
 we have @xmath186 . furthermore using and 
 we can write @xmath187 using this we can rewrite @xmath188 for @xmath189 as @xmath190 and by the dominated convergence theorem we obtain @xmath191 hence , ge1 is shown with @xmath94 as in . 
 moreover , we have @xmath192 $ ] , @xmath193 and @xmath94 is lower - semi - continuous .    * step 2 . 
 further assumptions of the grtner - ellis theorem : * we proceed by checking the assumptions ge2 and ge3 . for differentiability of @xmath94 for @xmath194 
 consider for @xmath195 the function @xmath196 we have @xmath197 for @xmath198 and the derivative @xmath199 exists for each @xmath200 and is continuous in @xmath149 . 
 hence , we can interchange differentiation and integration and obtain @xmath201 furthermore , for a sequence @xmath202 with @xmath203 we obtain @xmath204 i.e.  condition ge3 is also satisfied .    * step 3 . 
 properties of @xmath205 : * applying the grtner - ellis theorem reveals that the sequence of distributions of @xmath206 satisfies a large deviation principle with good rate function @xmath207= \sup_{t \leq      1 } \left [ \frac t2 x + \int_1^\infty      \log\left(1-\frac{t}{y^2}\right ) \,\emph dy \right].\end{aligned}\ ] ] in order to compute that supremum , we write for @xmath208 @xmath209 & = x -    2\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{y^2 - t}dy \\ & = x +    \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{y+\sqrt{t } } -    \frac{1}{y-\sqrt{t } } dy \\ & = x - \frac{1}{\sqrt{t } } \log    \frac{1+\sqrt{t}}{1-\sqrt{t}}\end{aligned}\ ] ] while for @xmath210 @xmath209 & = x -    2\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{y^2 + |t|}dy \\ & = x -    \frac{2}{\sqrt{|t|}}\arctan\sqrt{|t|}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] it is easy to see that the second derivative is negative throughout , such that the supremum is attained at @xmath211 given by the solution of @xmath212 for @xmath57 as in  . 
 finally we note that for @xmath213 the range of @xmath214 is @xmath215 and for @xmath216 $ ] the range of @xmath217 is @xmath218 $ ] . 
 hence , the scale function @xmath53 is of the form given in  .      the proof is based on the fact that @xmath219 . 
 thus , for @xmath220 we have @xmath221 and for @xmath222 @xmath223 the value @xmath224 follows from  . since the rate function @xmath53 attains its minimum at @xmath58 , is decreasing below and increasing above @xmath98 , the result follows . 
 when looking at , note that @xmath103 does not depend on the order of the @xmath126 s . 
 therefore , it is possible to order them according to their size . precisely , let @xmath225 be their order statistics . 
 then it is well - known that @xmath226 indeed , the smallest of @xmath1 independent exponentially distributed mean @xmath23 random variables is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath227 ( as does @xmath228 ) , and the second smallest then has the same distribution as @xmath229 etc . 
 now , we obtain as follows @xmath230      we start by proving  . 
 let @xmath110 and let @xmath231 be independent exponential random variables with mean @xmath23 . in what follows we set @xmath232 according to , it suffices to show that @xmath233 to this end we will show that for all @xmath234 , @xmath235 as well as @xmath236 and obtain by letting @xmath237 . 
 for   we have @xmath238 we consider the two terms on the right hand side of the last display separately and start with the first one . 
 observe that @xmath239 = \infty$ ] for @xmath168 , @xmath240 = 2 $ ] and @xmath241 for @xmath242 . 
 we use a variant of cramr s theorem for heavy - tailed random variables from @xcite . 
 in particular , we refer to the statement around equation ( 1.2 ) there ( the assumption there is fulfilled with @xmath243 replaced by @xmath244 and @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 ) . 
 we obtain @xmath248 for the second term on the right hand side of by the ( classical ) cramr theorem we obtain @xmath249 where @xmath250 is the fenchel - legendre transform of the function @xmath251 $ ] . now , using , and we obtain @xmath252 which shows . for the proof of 
 we write @xmath253 again we consider both terms in the last line separately . for the first term , as in 
 we obtain @xmath254 for the second term , we use the same argument as for and get @xmath255 combining   and   with   now gives   which proves  .    since the minimum of @xmath103 is @xmath23 ( when @xmath256 for all @xmath7 ) the assertion @xmath257 is clear . 
 it remains to prove , show that the rate function is of the form   and justify the positivity of @xmath115 for @xmath258 .    for @xmath259 
 using we obtain @xmath260 furthermore , for @xmath258 we have @xmath261/\sqrt{\mathbf e[r_1 ^ 2]}$ ] .

9,"rapid progress in the design and manufacture of optical fiber systems is a result of worldwide demand for ultra - high bit - rate optical communications . 
 this explains the growing interest of the soliton community in soliton - based optical fiber communication systems . 
 this area of research was considerably advanced in recent years  @xcite . 
 the most remarkable results include the application of the concept of the dispersion management to _ temporal optical solitons _ and soliton - based optical transmission systems , and the discovery of the so - called _ dispersion managed soliton_. high - speed optical communications require effective components such as high - performance broadband computer networks that can be developed by employing the concept of the bit - parallel - wavelength ( bpw ) pulse transmission that offers many of the advantages of both parallel fiber ribbon cable and conventional wavelength - division - multiplexing ( wdm ) systems  @xcite . 
 expanding development in the study of the soliton fiber systems has been observed in parallel with impressive research on their spatial counterparts , optical self - trapped beams or _ 
 spatial optical solitons_. one of the key concepts in this field came from the theory of multi - frequency wave mixing and cascaded nonlinearities where a nonlinear phase shift is produced as a result of the parametric wave interaction  @xcite . 
 in all such systems , the nonlinear interaction between the waves of two ( or more ) frequencies is the major physical effect that can support coupled - mode multi - frequency solitary waves . 
 the examples of temporal and spatial solitons mentioned above have one common feature : they involve the study of solitary waves in multi - component nonlinear models . 
 the main purpose of this paper is to overview several different physical examples of multi - mode and/or multi - frequency solitary waves that occur for the pulse or beam propagation in nonlinear optical fibers and waveguides . for these purposes , we select three different cases : multi - wavelength solitary waves in bit - parallel - wavelength optical fiber links , multi - colour spatial solitons due to multistep cascading in optical waveguides with quadratic nonlinearities , and quasiperiodic solitons in the fibonacci superlattices . 
 we believe these examples display both the diversity and richness of the multi - mode soliton systems , and they will allow further progress to be made in the study of nonlinear waves in multi - component nonintegrable physical models . 
 because the phenomenon of the long - distance propagation of _ temporal optical solitons _ in optical fibers  @xcite is known to a much broader community of researchers in optics and nonlinear physics , first we emphasize _ the difference between temporal and spatial solitary waves_. indeed , for a long time stationary beam propagation in planar waveguides has been considered somewhat similar to the pulse propagation in fibers . 
 this approach is based on the so - called _ spatio - temporal analogy _ in wave propagation , meaning that the propagation coordinate @xmath0 is treated as the evolution variable and the spatial beam profile along the transverse direction in waveguides , is similar to the temporal pulse profile in fibers . 
 this analogy is based on a simple notion that both beam evolution and pulse propagation can be described by the cubic nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation . 
 however , contrary to the widely accepted opinion , there is a crucial difference between temporal and spatial solitons . indeed , in the case of the nonstationary pulse propagation in fibers , the operation wavelength is usually selected near the zero point of the group - velocity dispersion . 
 this means that the absolute value of the fiber dispersion is small enough to be compensated by a weak nonlinearity such as that produced by the ( very weak ) kerr effect in optical fibers which leads to a relative nonlinearity - induced change in the refractive index . 
 therefore , nonlinearity in such systems is always weak and it should be well modeled by a cubic nls equation which is known to be integrable by means of the inverse - scattering technique . however , for very short ( e.g. , fs ) pulses the cubic nls equation describing the long - distance propagation of pulses should be corrected to include additional terms that would account for such effects as higher - order dispersion , raman scattering , etc . 
 all such corrections can be taken into account with the help of the perturbation theory  @xcite . 
 thus , in fibers nonlinear effects are weak and they become important only when dispersion is small ( near the zero - dispersion point ) affecting the pulse propagation over large distances ( of order of hundreds of meters or even kilometers ) . 
 the situation changes dramatically when we consider the propagation of multi - wavelength pulses with almost equal group velocities . 
 the corresponding model is described by a nonintegrable and rather complicated system of coupled nls equations , which we briefly discuss below .    in contrary to the pulse propagation in optical fibers , 
 the physics underlying the stationary beam propagation in planar waveguides and bulk media is different . in this case 
 an optical beam is generated by a continuous wave ( cw ) source and it is time independent . 
 however , when the beam evolves with the propagation distance @xmath0 , it diffracts in the transverse spatial directions . 
 then , a nonlinear change in the refractive index should compensate for the beam spreading caused by diffraction _ which is not a small effect_. that is why to observe spatial solitons as self - trapped optical beams , much larger nonlinearities are usually required , and very often such nonlinearities are not of the kerr type ( e.g. they saturate at higher intensities ) . 
 this leads to the models of generalized nonlinearities with the properties of solitary waves different from those described by the integrable cubic nls equation . 
 propagation distances involved in the phenomenon of the beam self - focusing and spatial soliton propagation are of the order of millimeters or centimeters . 
 to achieve such large nonlinearities , one needs to use the optical materials with large nonlinearity - induced refractive index . 
 one of the possible way to overcome this difficulty is to use the so - called _ cascaded nonlinearities _ of noncentrosymmetric optical materials where nonlinear effects are accumulated due to parametric wave interaction under the condition of the wave phase matching . 
 such parametric wave - mixing effects generate novel classes of spatial optical solitons where resonant parametric coupling between the envelopes of two ( or more ) beams of different frequencies supports stable spatially localised waves even in a bulk medium ( see details in ref . 
 it is this kind of multi - component solitary waves that we discuss below . 
 a growing demand for high - speed computer communications requires an effective and inexpensive computer interconnection . 
 one attractive alternative to the conventional wdm systems is bpw single - mode fiber optics links for very high bandwidth computer communications  @xcite . 
 they differ from the wdm schemes in that no parallel to serial conversion is necessary , and parallel pulses are launched simultaneously on different wavelengths . 
 when the pulses of different wavelengths are transmitted simultaneously , the cross - phase modulation can produce an interesting _ pulse shepherding effect _ 
 @xcite , when a strong ( `` shepherd '' ) pulse enables the manipulation and control of pulses co - propagating on different wavelengths in a multi - channel optical fiber link .    to describe the simultaneous transmission of @xmath1 different wavelengths in a nonlinear optical fiber , we follow the standard derivation  @xcite and obtain a system of @xmath1 coupled nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations @xmath2 ) : @xmath3 { \displaystyle \qquad      + \chi_j \left ( |a_j|^2 + 2 \sum_{m \neq j } |a_m|^2 
 \right ) a_j      = 0 ,    } \end{array}\ ] ] where , for the @xmath4th wave , @xmath5 is the slowly varying envelope , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the group velocity and group - velocity dispersion , respectively , and the nonlinear coefficients @xmath8 characterize the kerr effect 
 . equations  ( [ eq : nls_dim ] ) do not include the fiber loss , since the fiber lengths involved in bit - parallel links are only a small fraction of the attenuation length . 
 we measure the variables in the units of the central wavelength channel ( say , @xmath9 ) , and obtain the following normalized system of the @xmath1 coupled nls equations , @xmath10 { \displaystyle \qquad      + \gamma_j \left(|u_j|^2 + 2 \sum_{m\neq j } |u_m|^2\right ) u_j      = 0 ,    } \end{array}\ ] ] where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the incident optical power in the central channel , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 . for the operating wavelengths spaced @xmath16 nm apart within the band @xmath17 nm , the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 are different but close to @xmath20 . initially , in eq . 
 ( [ eq : nls ] ) , we omit the mode walk - off effect described by the parameters @xmath21 ( so that @xmath22 ) . 
 this effect will be analysed later in this section .    to analyze the nonlinear modes , i.e. localized states of the bpw model ( [ eq : nls ] ) 
 , we look for stationary solutions in the form , @xmath23 and therefore obtain the system of equations for the normalized mode amplitudes , @xmath24 { \displaystyle     \frac{1}{2 } \alpha_n \frac{d^2u_n}{dt^2 }      + \gamma_n \left ( |u_n|^2      + 2\sum_{m \neq n } |u_m|^2 \right ) u_n      = \lambda_n u_n ,   } \end{array}\ ] ] where @xmath25 , the amplitudes and time are measured in the units of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , and @xmath28 .    system ( [ eq : nls_nn ] ) has _ exact analytical solutions _ for @xmath1 coupled components , the so - called _ 
 bpw solitons_. indeed , looking for solutions in the form @xmath29 , @xmath30 , we obtain the constraint @xmath31 , and a system of @xmath1 coupled algebraic equations for the wave amplitudes , @xmath32 in a special symmetric case , we take @xmath33 , and the solution of those equations is simple  @xcite : + @xmath34^{-1/2}$ ] . 
 analytical solutions can also be obtained in the _ linear limit _ 
 , when the central frequency pulse ( at @xmath35 ) is large . then , linearizing eqs . 
 ( [ eq : nls_nn ] ) for small @xmath36 , we obtain a decoupled nonlinear equation for @xmath37 and @xmath38 decoupled linear equations for @xmath39 . each of the latter possess a localized solution provided @xmath40 , where @xmath41 ^ 2 $ ] . in this limit 
 the central soliton pulse @xmath37 ( `` shepherd pulse '' ) can be considered as inducing an effective waveguide that supports a fundamental mode @xmath39 with the corresponding cutoff @xmath42 . 
 since , by definition , the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 are close to @xmath20 , we can verify that the soliton - induced waveguide supports maximum of two modes ( fundamental and the first excited one ) . 
 this is an important physical result that explains the effective robustness of the pulse guidance by the shepherding pulse .    to demonstrate a number of unique properties of the multi - channel bpw solitons , we consider the case @xmath45 in more details . 
 a comprehensive discussion of the case @xmath46 can be found in the preprint  @xcite . 
 we select the following set of the normalized parameters : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . 
 solitary waves of this four - wavelength bpw system can be found numerically as localized solutions of eqs . 
 ( [ eq : nls_nn ] ) . figure  [ fig : bpw1 ] presents the lowest - order families of such localized solutions . in general 
 , they are characterized by @xmath38 parameters , but we can capture the characteristic features by presenting power dependencies along the line @xmath50 in the parameter space @xmath51 . 
 the power of the central - wavelength component ( @xmath35 ) does not depend on @xmath52 ( straight line @xmath53 ) . 
 thin dashed , dotted , and dash - dotted curves correspond to the three separate single - mode solitons of the multi - channel bpw system , ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) , respectively , shown with the corresponding branches of ( 0 + 1 ) , ( 0 + 2 ) , and ( 0 + 3 ) two - mode solitons . 
 the latter curves start off from the bifurcation points on the @xmath37 branch at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , respectively . 
 close separation of those curves is the result of closeness of the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath57 . 
 thick solid curves in fig . 
 [ fig : bpw1 ] correspond to the two- ( 1 + 2 ) and three - mode ( 0 + 1 + 2 ) localized solutions . 
 the latter solutions bifurcate and give birth to four - wavelength solitons ( 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 ) ( branch a - b ) . 
 two examples of such four - wave composite solitons are shown in fig . 
 [ fig : bpw1 ] ( bottom row ) . 
 the solution b is close to an exact sech - type solution at @xmath58 ( described above ) for @xmath45 , whereas the solution a is close to that approximately described in the linear limit in the vicinity of a bifurcation point . 
 importantly , for different values of the parameters @xmath59 , the uppermost bifurcation point for this branch ( open circle in fig . [ 
 fig : bpw1 ] ) is not predicted by a simple linear theory and , due to the nonlinear mode coupling , it gets shifted from the branch of the central - wavelength soliton ( straight line ) to a two - mode branch ( 0 + 1 + 2 ) ( thick solid curve ) .    as a result , if we start on the right end of the horizontal branch and follow the lowest branches of the total power @xmath60 in fig . 
 [ fig : bpw1 ] , we pass the following sequence of the soliton families and bifurcation points : @xmath61 . if the modal parameters are selected closer to each other , the first two links of _ the bifurcation cascade _ disappear ( i.e. the corresponding bifurcation points merge ) , and the four - mode soliton bifurcates directly from the central - wavelength pulse , as predicted by the linear theory . 
 note however that the sequence and location of the bifurcation points is a function of the cross - section of the parameter space @xmath51 , and the results presented above correspond to the choice @xmath62 .    the qualitative picture of the cascading bifurcations preserves for other values of @xmath1 . 
 in particular , near the bifurcation point a mixed - mode soliton corresponds to the localized modes guided by the central - wavelength soliton ( shepherd ) pulse . 
 the existence of such soliton solutions is a key concept of bpw transmission when the data are launched in parallel carrying a desirable set of bits of information , all guided by the shepherd pulse at a selected wavelength . 
 effects of the walk - off on the multi - channel bpw solitons seems to be most dangerous for the pulse alignment in the parallel links . for nearly equal soliton components , 
 it was shown long time ago @xcite that nonlinearity can provide an effective trapping mechanism to keep the pulses together . for the shepherding effect , the corresponding numerical simulations are presented in figs . 
 [ fig : bpw2](a - d ) for the four - channel bpw system . 
 initially , we launch a composite four - mode soliton as an unperturbed solution a [ see fig .  [ 
 fig : bpw1 ] ] of eqs . 
 ( [ eq : nls ] ) , without walk - off and centered at @xmath63 . 
 when this solution evolves along the propagation direction @xmath0 in the presence of small to moderate relative walk - off ( @xmath64 for @xmath65 ) , its components remain strongly localized and mutually trapped [ fig . 
 [ fig : bpw2](a , b ) ] , whereas it loses some energy into radiation for much larger values of the relative mode walk - off [ fig . 
 [ fig : bpw2](c , d ) ] . 
 recent progress in the study of cascading effects in optical materials with quadratic ( second - order or @xmath66 ) nonlinear response has offered new opportunities for all - optical processing , optical communications , and optical solitons  @xcite . 
 most of the studies of cascading effects employ parametric wave mixing processes with a single phase - matching and , as a result , two - step cascading  @xcite . 
 for example , the two - step cascading associated with type i second - harmonic generation ( shg ) includes the generation of the second harmonic ( @xmath67 ) followed by reconstruction of the fundamental wave through the down - conversion frequency mixing ( dfm ) process ( @xmath68 ) . 
 these two processes are governed by one phase - matched interaction and they differ only in the direction of power conversion .    the idea to explore more than one simultaneous nearly phase - matched process , or _ 
 double - phase - matched ( dpm ) wave interaction _ , became attractive only recently  @xcite , for the purposes of all - optical transistors , enhanced nonlinearity - induced phase shifts , and polarization switching . 
 in particular , it was shown  @xcite that multistep cascading can be achieved by two second - order nonlinear cascading processes , shg and sum - frequency mixing ( sfm ) , and these two processes can also support a novel class of multi - colour parametric solitons  @xcite , briefly discussed below .      to introduce the simplest model of multistep cascading , 
 we consider the fundamental beam with frequency @xmath69 entering a noncentrosymmetric nonlinear medium with a quadratic response . as a first step , 
 the second - harmonic wave with frequency @xmath70 is generated via the shg process . 
 as a second step , we expect the generation of higher order harmonics due to sfm , for example , a third harmonic ( @xmath71 ) or even fourth harmonic ( @xmath72 )  @xcite . 
 when both such processes are nearly phase matched , they can lead , via down - conversion , to a large nonlinear phase shift of the fundamental wave  @xcite . 
 additionally , the multistep cascading can support _ a novel type of three - wave spatial solitary waves _ in a diffractive @xmath66 nonlinear medium , _ multistep cascading solitons_.    we start our analysis with the reduced amplitude equations derived in the slowly varying envelope approximation with the assumption of zero absorption of all interacting waves ( see , e.g. , ref . 
 @xcite ) . introducing the effect of diffraction in a slab waveguide geometry 
 , we obtain @xmath73 { \displaystyle   \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad      + \chi_{2}a_{2 } a_{1}^{\ast}e^{-i\delta k_{2}z } = 0 ,     } \\*[9pt ] { \displaystyle       4

 ( [ physeqns ] ) , @xmath81,@xmath82 and @xmath83 are the complex electric field envelopes of the fundamental harmonic ( fh ) , second harmonic ( sh ) , and third harmonic ( th ) , respectively , @xmath84 is the wavevector mismatch for the shg process , and @xmath85 is the wavevector mismatch for the sfm process . 
 the subscripts ` 1 ' denote the fh wave , the subscripts ` 2 ' denote the sh wave , and the subscripts ` 3 ' , the th wave . 
 following the technique earlier employed in refs . 
 @xcite , we look for stationary solutions of eq . 
 ( [ physeqns ] ) and introduce the normalised envelope @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 according to the relations , @xmath89 { \displaystyle       a_{2 } = \frac{2 \beta k_{1}}{\chi_{2}}e^{2i\beta z + i\delta k_{2 } z } v ,     } \\*[9pt ] { \displaystyle       a_{3 } = \frac{\sqrt{2\chi_{2}}\beta      k_{1}}{\chi_{1}\sqrt{\chi_{5}}}e^{3i\beta z + i\delta k z } u ,    } \end{array}\ ] ] where @xmath90 . renormalising the variables as @xmath91 and @xmath92 , we finally obtain a system of coupled equations , @xmath93 { \displaystyle 2i \frac{\partial v}{\partial z } + \frac{\partial^{2 } v}{\partial x^{2 } } - \alpha v + \frac{1}{2 } w^{2 } + w^{\ast}u = 0 , } \\*[9pt ] { \displaystyle 3i\frac{\partial u}{\partial z } + \frac{\partial^{2 } u}{\partial x^{2 } } - \alpha_{1}u + \chi vw = 0 , } \\*[9pt ] \end{array}\ ] ] where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are two dimensionless parameters that characterise the nonlinear phase matching between the parametrically interacting waves . 
 dimensionless material parameter @xmath96 depends on the type of phase matching , and it can take different values of order of one . 
 for example , when both shg and sfm are due to quasi - phase matching ( qpm ) , we have @xmath97 $ ] , where @xmath98 . 
 then , for the first - order @xmath99 qpm processes ( see , e.g. , ref . 
 @xcite ) , we have @xmath100 , and therefore @xmath101 . when sfm is due to the third - order qpm process ( see , e.g. , ref . 
 @xcite ) , we should take @xmath102 , and therefore @xmath103 . at 
 last , when sfm is the fifth - order qpm process , we have @xmath104 and @xmath105 . 
 dimensionless equations ( [ normal ] ) present a fundamental model for three - wave multistep cascading solitons in the absence of walk - off . additionally to the type 
 i shg solitons ( see , e.g. , refs  @xcite ) , the multistep cascading solitons involve the phase - matched sfm interaction ( @xmath106 ) that generates a third harmonic wave . 
 two - parameter family of localised solutions consists of three mutually coupled waves . 
 it is interesting to note that , similar to the case of nondegenerate three - wave mixing  @xcite , eqs . 
 ( [ normal ] ) possess an exact solution . to find it , we make a substitution @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and obtain unknown parameters from the following algebraic equations @xmath110 valid for @xmath111 and @xmath112 . 
 equations ( [ exactsol ] ) have two solutions corresponding to _ positive _ and _ negative _ values of the amplitude ( @xmath113 ) . 
 this indicates a possibility of multi - valued solutions , even within the class of exact solutions .    in general , three - wave solitons of eqs . 
 ( [ normal ] ) can be found only numerically . 
 figures [ fig : tr1](a ) and [ fig : tr1](b ) present two examples of solitary waves for different sets of the mismatch parameters @xmath114 and @xmath115 . 
 when @xmath116 [ see fig . 
 [ fig : tr1](a ) ] , which corresponds to an unmatched sfm process , the amplitude of the third harmonic is small , and it vanishes for @xmath117 .    to summarise different types of three - wave solitary waves , in fig . 
 [ fig : tr2 ] we plot the dependence of the total soliton power defined as @xmath118 . 
 it is clearly seen that for some values of @xmath119 ( including the exact solution at @xmath120 shown by two filled circles ) , there exist _ two different branches _ of three - wave solitary waves , and only one of those branches approaches , for large values of @xmath119 , a family of two - wave solitons of the cascading limit ( fig .  [ fig : tr2 ] , dashed ) . the slope of the branches changes from negative ( for small @xmath119 ) to positive ( for large @xmath119 ) , indicating a possible change of the soliton stability . 
 however , the detailed analysis of the soliton stability is beyond the scope of this paper ( see , e.g. , refs . 
 @xcite ) . 
 another type of multistep cascading parametric processes which involve only two frequencies , i.e. _ two - colour multistep cascading _ 
 , can occur due to the vectorial interaction of waves with different polarization . 
 we denote two orthogonal polarization components of the fundamental harmonic ( fh ) wave ( @xmath121 ) as a and b , and two orthogonal polarizations of the second harmonic ( sh ) wave ( @xmath122 ) , as s and t. then , a simple multistep cascading process consists of the following steps . 
 first , the fh wave a generates the sh wave s via type i shg process . 
 then , by down - conversion 
 sa - b , the orthogonal fh wave b is generated . 
 at last , the initial fh wave a is reconstructed by the processes sb - a or ab - s , sa - a . 
 two principal second - order processes aa - s and ab - s correspond to _ two different components _ of the @xmath66 susceptibility tensor , thus introducing additional degrees of freedom into the parametric interaction . 
 different cases of such type of multistep cascading processes are summarized in table  [ tab : dpm ] .    to demonstrate some of the unique properties of the multistep cascading 
 , we discuss here how it can be employed for soliton - induced waveguiding effects in quadratic media . for this purpose 
 , we consider a model of two - frequency multistep cascading described by the principal dpm process ( c ) ( see table  [ tab : dpm ] above ) in the planar slab - waveguide geometry . 
 using the slowly varying envelope approximation with the assumption of zero absorption of all interacting waves , we obtain @xmath123 { \displaystyle       2 i k_{1}\frac{\partial b}{\partial z } + \frac{\partial^{2 } b }       { \partial x^{2 } } + \chi_2 s b^{\ast}e^{-i\delta k_2 z } = 0 ,    } \\*[9pt ] { \displaystyle       4 i k_{1 } \frac{\partial s}{\partial z }       + \frac{\partial^{2 } s}{\partial x^{2 } }       + 2 \chi_1 a^2 e^{i\delta k_1 z }       + 2 \chi_2 b^2 e^{i\delta k_2 z }       = 0 ,    } \end{array}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath74 , the nonlinear coupling coefficients @xmath77 are proportional to the elements of the second - order susceptibility tensor , and @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the corresponding wave - vector mismatch parameters .    to simplify the system ( [ eq_1 ] ) , we look for its stationary solutions and introduce the normalized envelopes @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 according to the following relations , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 , where @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , and the longitudinal and transverse coordinates are measured in the units of @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively . 
 then , we obtain a system of normalized equations , @xmath137    { \displaystyle      i \frac{\partial v}{\partial z } +       \frac{\partial^{2 } v}{\partial x^{2 } } - \alpha_1 v + \chi v^{\ast}w= 0 , }                        \\*[9pt ]    { \displaystyle      2i \frac{\partial w}{\partial z } +       \frac{\partial^{2}w}{\partial x^{2 } } - \alpha w+\frac{1}{2}(u^2+v^2)= 0 , }    \end{array}\ ] ] where @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 . 
 first of all , we notice that for @xmath141 ( or , similarly , @xmath142 ) , the dimensionless eqs . 
 ( [ eq_n ] ) reduce to the corresponding model for the two - step cascading due to type i shg discussed earlier @xcite , and its stationary solutions are defined by the equations for real @xmath126 and @xmath128 , @xmath143    { \displaystyle     \frac{d^2 w}{d x^{2 } } - \alpha w + \frac{1}{2 } u^2 = 0 , }    \end{array}\ ] ] that possess a one - parameter family of two - wave localized solutions @xmath144 found earlier numerically for any @xmath145 , and also known analytically for @xmath146 , @xmath147 ( see ref . 
 @xcite ) . 
 then , in the small - amplitude approximation , the equation for real orthogonally polarized fh wave @xmath127 can be treated as an eigenvalue problem for an effective waveguide created by the sh field @xmath148 , @xmath149 v = 0.\ ] ] therefore , an additional parametric process allows to propagate a probe beam of one polarization in _ an effective waveguide _ created by a two - wave spatial soliton in a quadratic medium with fh component of another polarization . 
 however , this type of waveguide is different from what has been studied for kerr - like solitons because it is _ coupled parametrically _ to the guided modes and , as a result , the physical picture of the guided modes is valid , rigorously speaking , only in the case of stationary phase - matched beams . as a result , the stability of the corresponding waveguide and localized modes of the orthogonal polarization it guides is a key issue . in particular , the waveguide itself ( i.e. _ two - wave parametric soliton _ ) becomes unstable for @xmath150  @xcite .    in order to find the guided modes of the parametric waveguide created by a two - wave quadratic soliton 
 , we have to solve eq . 
 ( [ eq_eigen ] ) where the exact solution @xmath148 is to be found numerically . 
 then , to address this problem analytically , approximate solutions can be used , such as those found with the help of the variational method  @xcite . 
 however , the different types of the variational ansatz used do not provide a very good approximation for the soliton profile at all @xmath114 . 
 for our eigenvalue problem ( [ eq_eigen ] ) , the function @xmath148 defines parameters of the guided modes and , in order to obtain accurate results , it should be calculated as close as possible to the exact solutions found numerically . to resolve this difficulty , below we suggest a novel `` almost exact '' solution that _ would allow to solve analytically many of the problems involving quadratic solitons _ 
 , including the eigenvalue problem  ( [ eq_eigen ] ) . 
 first , we notice that from the exact solution at @xmath146 and the asymptotic result for large @xmath114 , @xmath151 , it follows that the sh component @xmath148 of eqs . 
 ( [ eq_2 ] ) remains almost self - similar for @xmath152 . 
 thus , we look for the sh field in the form @xmath153 , where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are to be defined . 
 the solution for @xmath156 should be consistent with this choice of the shape for sh , and it is defined by the first ( linear for @xmath126 ) equation of the system ( [ eq_2 ] ) . 
 therefore , we can take @xmath126 in the form of the lowest guided mode , @xmath157 , that corresponds to an effective waveguide @xmath148 . by matching the asymptotics of these trial functions with those defined directly from eqs . 
 ( [ eq_2 ] ) at small and large @xmath158 , we obtain the following solution , @xmath159 @xmath160 here , the third relation allows us to find @xmath154 for arbitrary @xmath114 as a solution of a cubic equation , and then to find all other parameters as functions of @xmath114 . for mismatches in the interval @xmath161 
 , the parameter values change monotonically in the regions : @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 . 
 it is really amazing that the analytical solution  ( [ eq_s]),([eq_p ] ) provides _ an excellent approximation _ for the profiles of the two - wave parametric solitons found numerically , with the relative errors not exceeding 1%3% for stable solitons 
 ( e.g. when @xmath165 ) . as a matter of fact 
 , we can treat eqs . 
 ( [ eq_s ] ) and  ( [ eq_p ] ) as an _ 
 approximate scaling transformation _ of the family of two - wave bright solitons . 
 moreover , this solution allows us to capture some remarkable internal similarities and distinctions between the solitons existing in different types of nonlinear media . 
 in particular , as follows from eqs . 
 ( [ eq_s ] ) and  ( [ eq_p ] ) , the fh component and the self - consistent effective waveguide ( created by the sh field ) have approximately the same stationary transverse profiles as for one - component solitons in a kerr - like medium with power - law nonlinear response  @xcite . for @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) and @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) 
 our general expressions reduce to the known analytical solutions , and the fh profile is exactly the same as that for solitons in quadratic and cubic kerr media , respectively . 
 on the other hand , the strength of self - action for quadratic solitons depends on the normalized phase mismatch @xmath114 and , in general , the beam dynamics for parametric wave mixing can be very different from that observed in kerr - type media . 
 now , the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq_eigen ] ) can be readily solved analytically . 
 the eigenmode cutoff values are defined by the parameter @xmath119 that takes one of the discrete values , @xmath170 , where @xmath171^{1/2}$ ] . 
 number @xmath172 stands for the mode order @xmath173 , and the localized solutions are possible provided @xmath174 . 
 the profiles of the corresponding guided modes are @xmath175 where @xmath176 , @xmath177 is the hypergeometric function , and @xmath178 is the mode s amplitude which can not be determined within the framework of the linear analysis .    according to these results , a two - wave parametric soliton creates , a multi - mode waveguide and larger number of the guided modes can be observed for smaller @xmath114 . 
 figures  [ fig : al1](a , b ) show the dependence of the mode cutoff values @xmath179 for a fixed @xmath180 , and @xmath181 for a fixed @xmath114 , respectively . for the case 
 @xmath103 , the dependence has a simple form : @xmath182 ^ 2 $ ] . 
 because a two - wave soliton creates an induced waveguide parametrically coupled to its guided modes of the orthogonal polarization , the dynamics of the guided modes _ may differ drastically _ from that of conventional waveguides based on the kerr - type nonlinearities . 
 figures   show two examples of the evolution of guided modes . in the first example 
 [ see fig . 
 [ fig : wave_w](a - c ) ] , a weak fundamental mode is amplified via parametric interaction with a soliton waveguide , and the mode experiences a strong power exchange with the orthogonally polarized fh component through the sh field . 
 this process is accompanied by only a weak deformation of the induced waveguide [ see fig .  [ 
 fig : wave_w](a )  dotted curve ] . 
 the resulting effect can be interpreted as a power exchange between two guided modes of orthogonal polarizations in a waveguide created by the sh field . in the second example , the propagation is stable [ see fig .  [ 
 fig : wave_w](d ) ] .    when all the fields in eq . 
 ( [ eq_n ] ) are not small , i.e. the small - amplitude approximation is no longer valid , the profiles of the three - component solitons should be found numerically . however , some of the lowest - order states can be calculated approximately using the approach of the `` almost exact '' solution ( [ eq_s]),([eq_p ] ) described above , which is presented in detail elsewhere  @xcite . 
 moreover , a number of the solutions and their families can be obtained in _ 
 an explicit analytical form_. for example , for @xmath183 , there exist two _ families of three - component solitary waves _ for any @xmath152 , that describe soliton branches starting at the bifurcation points @xmath184 at : ( i )  the soliton with a zero - order guided mode for @xmath185 : @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and ( ii )  the soliton with a first - order guided mode for @xmath103 : @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath188 , where @xmath191 and @xmath192 .    for a practical realization of 
 the dpm processes and the soliton waveguiding effects described above , we can suggest two general methods . 
 the first method is based on the use of _ two commensurable periods _ of the quasi - phase - matched ( qpm ) periodic grating . indeed , to achieve dpm 
 , we can employ the first - order qpm for one parametric process , and the third - order qpm , for the other parametric process . 
 taking , as an example , the parameters for linbo@xmath193 and aa - s @xmath194 and bb - s @xmath195 processes @xcite , we find two points for dpm at about 0.89 @xmath196 m and 1.25 @xmath196 m . 
 this means that a single qpm grating can provide simultaneous phase - matching for two parametric processes . 
 for such a configuration , we obtain @xmath197 or , interchanging the polarization components , @xmath198 . the second method to achieve the conditions of dpm processes 
 is based on the idea of _ quasi - periodic qpm grating _ 
 specifically , fibonacci optical superlattices provide an effective way to achieve phase - matching at _ several incommensurable periods _ allowing multi - frequency harmonic generation in a single structure . 
 we describe the properties of such structures in the next section . 
 for many years , solitary waves have been considered as _ coherent localized modes _ of nonlinear systems , with particle - like dynamics quite dissimilar to the irregular and stochastic behavior observed for chaotic systems  @xcite . however , about 20 years ago akira hasegawa , while developing a statistical description of the dynamics of an ensemble of plane waves in nonlinear strongly dispersive plasmas , suggested the concept of a localized envelope of random phase waves  @xcite . because of the relatively high powers required for generating self - localized random waves , this notion remained a theoretical curiosity until recently , when the possibility to generate spatial optical solitons by a partially incoherent source was discovered in a photorefractive medium  @xcite . 
 the concept of incoherent solitons can be compared with a different problem : the propagation of a soliton through a spatially disordered medium . indeed , due to random scattering on defects , the phases of the individual components forming a soliton experience random fluctuations , and the soliton itself becomes _ partially incoherent _ in space and time . for a low - amplitude wave ( linear regime ) 
 spatial incoherence is known to lead to a fast decay . as a result 
 , the transmission coefficient vanishes exponentially with the length of the system , the phenomenon known as anderson localization  @xcite . 
 however , for large amplitudes ( nonlinear regime ) , when the nonlinearity length is much smaller than the anderson localization length , a soliton can propagate almost unchanged through a disordered medium as predicted theoretically in 1990 @xcite and recently verified experimentally  @xcite .    these two important physical concepts , spatial self - trapping of light generated by an incoherent source in a homogeneous medium , and suppression of anderson localization for large - amplitude waves in spatially disordered media , both result from the effect of strong nonlinearity . 
 when the nonlinearity is sufficiently strong it acts as _ an effective phase - locking mechanism _ by producing a large frequency shift of the different random - phase components , and thereby introducing _ an effective order _ into an incoherent wave packet , thus enabling the formation of localized structures . in other words , 
 both phenomena correspond to the limit when the ratio of the nonlinearity length to the characteristic length of ( spatial or temporal ) fluctuations is small . in the opposite limit , when this ratio is large , the wave propagation is practically linear .    below we show that , at least for aperiodic inhomogeneous structures , solitary waves can exist in the intermediate regime in the form of _ quasiperiodic nonlinear localized modes_. as an example , we consider shg and nonlinear beam propagation in _ fibonacci optical superlattices _ , and demonstrate numerically the possibility of spatial self - trapping of quasiperiodic waves whose envelope amplitude varies quasiperiodically , while still maintaining a stable , well - defined spatially localized structure , _ a quasiperiodic envelope soliton_.      we consider the interaction of a fundamental wave with the frequency @xmath69 ( fh ) and its sh in a slab waveguide with quadratic ( or @xmath66 ) nonlinearity . assuming the @xmath66 susceptibility to be modulated and the nonlinearity to be of the same order as diffraction , we write the dynamical equations in the form @xmath199     { \displaystyle i\frac{\partial w}{\partial z } + \frac{1}{4 }     \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2 } + d(z ) u^2 e^{i\beta z } =   0 , }    \end{array}\ ] ] where @xmath200 and @xmath201 are the slowly varying envelopes of the fh and sh , respectively . 
 the parameter @xmath202 is proportional to the phase mismatch @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 being the wave numbers at the two frequencies . 
 the transverse coordinate @xmath158 is measured in units of the input beam width @xmath206 , and the propagation distance @xmath0 in units of the diffraction length @xmath207 . 
 the spatial modulation of the @xmath66 susceptibility is described by the quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) grating function @xmath208 . in the context of shg 
 , the qpm technique is an effective way to achieve phase matching , and it has been studied intensively  @xcite .    here 
 we consider a qpm grating produced by a quasiperiodic nonlinear optical superlattice . 
 quasiperiodic optical superlattices , one - dimensional analogs of quasicrystals  @xcite , are usually designed to study the effect of anderson localization in the linear regime of light propagation . 
 for example , gellermann _ et al . 
 _ measured the optical transmission properties of quasiperiodic dielectric multilayer stacks of sio@xmath209 and tio@xmath209 thin films and observed a strong suppression of the transmission  @xcite . for qpm gratings , a nonlinear quasiperiodic superlattice of litao@xmath193 , in which two antiparallel ferro - electric domains are arranged in a fibonacci sequence , 
 was recently fabricated by zhu _ 
 et al . _ 
 @xcite , who measured multi - colour shg with energy conversion efficiencies of @xmath210 . 
 this quasiperiodic optical superlattice in litao@xmath193 can also be used for efficient direct third harmonic generation @xcite . 
 the quasiperiodic qpm gratings have two building blocks a and b of the length @xmath211 and @xmath212 , respectively , which are ordered in a fibonacci sequence [ fig . 
 [ fig : d_z](a ) ] . 
 each block has a domain of length @xmath213=l ( @xmath214=l ) with @xmath215=@xmath216 ( shaded ) and a domain of length @xmath217=@xmath218 [ @xmath219=@xmath220 with @xmath215=@xmath221 ( white ) . in the case of @xmath66 
 nonlinear qpm superlattices this corresponds to positive and negative ferro - electric domains , respectively . 
 the specific details of this type of fibonacci optical superlattices can be found elsewhere  @xcite . for our simulations presented below 
 we have chosen @xmath222= @xmath223= 0.34 , where @xmath224= @xmath225 is the so - called _ 
 golden ratio_. this means that the ratio of length scales is also the golden ratio , @xmath226= @xmath224 . 
 furthermore , we have chosen @xmath227=0.1 . 
 the grating function @xmath208 , which varies between @xmath216 and @xmath221 according to the fibonacci sequence , can be expanded in a fourier series @xmath228 where @xmath229=@xmath230=0.52 for the chosen parameter values . 
 hence the spectrum is composed of sums and differences of the basic wavenumbers @xmath231=@xmath232 and @xmath233=@xmath234 . 
 these components fill the whole fourier space densely , since @xmath231 and @xmath233 are incommensurate . 
 figure  [ fig : d_z](b ) shows the numerically calculated fourier spectrum @xmath235 . 
 the lowest - order `` fibonacci modes '' are clearly the most intense .      to analyze the beam propagation and shg in a quasiperiodic qpm grating one 
 could simply average eqs . 
 ( [ dynam ] ) . 
 to lowest order this approach always yields a system of equations with constant mean - value coefficients , which does not allow to describe oscillations of the beam amplitude and phase . 
 however , here we wish to go beyond the averaged equations and consider the rapid large - amplitude variations of the envelope functions . 
 this can be done analytically for periodic qpm gratings  @xcite . however , for the quasiperiodic gratings we have to resolve to numerical simulations . 
 thus we have solved eqs . 
 ( [ dynam ] ) numerically with a second - order split - step routine . at the input of the crystal 
 we excite the fundamental beam ( corresponding to unseeded shg ) with a gaussian profile , @xmath236 we consider the quasiperiodic qpm grating with matching to the peak at @xmath237 , i.e. , @xmath238=@xmath237=82.25 . 
 first , we study the small - amplitude limit when a weak fh is injected with a low amplitude . 
 figures  [ fig : soliton](a , b ) show an example of the evolution of fh and sh in this effectively linear regime . as is clearly seem from fig . 
 [ fig : soliton](b ) the sh wave is excited , but both beams eventually diffract . 
 when the amplitude of the input beam exceeds a certain threshold , self - focusing and localization should be observed for both harmonics . 
 figures  [ fig : soliton](c , d ) show an example of the evolution of a strong input fh beam , and its corresponding sh . again 
 the sh is generated , but now the nonlinearity is so strong that it leads to self - focusing and mutual self - trapping of the two fields , resulting in a spatially localized two - component soliton , despite the continuous scattering of the quasiperiodic qpm grating . 
 it is important to notice that the two - component localized beam created due to the self - trapping effect is quasiperiodic by itself . as a matter of fact , after an initial transient its amplitude oscillates in phase with the quasiperiodic qpm modulation @xmath208 . 
 this is illustrated in fig . 
 [ fig : oscillations ] , where we show in more detail the peak intensities in the asymptotic regime of the evolution . the oscillations shown in fig .  [ 
 fig : oscillations ] are in phase with the oscillations of the qpm grating @xmath208 , and we indeed found that their spectra are similar . 
 our numerical results show that the quasiperiodic envelope solitons can be generated for a broad range of the phase - mismatch @xmath238 . 
 the amplitude and width of the solitons depend on the effective mismatch , which is the separation between @xmath238 and the nearest strong peak @xmath235 in the fibonacci qpm grating spectrum [ see fig .  [ 
 fig : d_z](b ) ] . 
 thus , low - amplitude broad solitons are excited for @xmath238-values in between peaks , whereas high - amplitude narrow solitons are excited when @xmath238 is close to a strong peak , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : soliton](c , d ) . 
 to analyse in more detail the transition between the linear ( diffraction ) and nonlinear ( self - trapping ) regimes , we have made a series of careful numerical simulations  @xcite . in fig . 
 [ fig : transmission ] we show the transmission coefficients and the beam widths at the output of the crystal versus the intensity of the fh input beam , for a variety of @xmath238-values . 
 these dependencies clearly illustrate the universality of the generation of localised modes for varying strength of nonlinearity , i.e. a quasiperiodic soliton is generated only for sufficiently high amplitudes . 
 this is of course a general phenomenon also observed in many nonlinear isotropic media . 
 however , here the self - trapping occurs for quasiperiodic waves , with the quasiperiodicity being preserved in the variation of the amplitude of both components of the soliton . 
 we have overviewed several important physical examples of the multi - component solitary waves which appear due to multi - mode and/or multi - frequency coupling in nonlinear optical fibers and waveguides . 
 we have described several types of such multi - component solitary waves , including : ( i )  multi - wavelength solitary waves in multi - channel bit - parallel - wavelength fiber transmission systems , ( ii )  multi - colour parametric spatial solitary waves due to multistep cascading in quadratic materials , and ( iii )  quasiperiodic envelope solitons in fibonacci optical superlattices . 
 these examples reveal some general features and properties of multi - component solitary waves in nonintegrable nonlinear models , also serving as a stepping stone for approaching other problems of the multi - mode soliton coupling and interaction .

10,"entanglement @xcite in a composite system refers to certain implicit correlation between the subsystems arising from their interaction . 
 it is the key resource of quantum computation and quantum information processing @xcite . 
 due to recent advances in this field , entanglement has generated renewed interest . 
 there have been different approaches to understand and to quantify entanglement @xcite . 
 but so far the entanglement , only in a bipartite pure state has been investigated very extensively . 
 the von neumann entropy @xcite of either of the subsystems provides a good measure of entanglement in this case @xcite . 
 this is the quantum partner of the shannon s entropy @xcite in classical information theory and is defined as @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 . here , @xmath3 is the reduced density operator of the subsystem @xmath4 and is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the density operator of the composite system under consideration and @xmath7 , @xmath8 . 
 in general , the quantities @xmath9 satisfy the following inequality ( due to araki and lieb ) @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the joint entropy of the composite system comprising @xmath12 and @xmath13 . 
 the second part of the above inequality is known as subadditivity inequality @xcite . for a pure state , @xmath14 and thus @xmath15 . 
 the equality sign in the above relation holds good if and only if the composite density matrix @xmath6 can be written as a tensor product of its two reduced density matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 , i.e. , for a disentangled state . 
 one can define the index of correlation @xmath18 given by the expression @xmath19 @xcite , which can also be interpreted as information entropy in quantum information point of view . 
 we note that kim _ 
 et al . _ have calculated the entropies of different kinds of pure states including two - mode fock states and squeezed states @xcite . 
 further , the above relation for entropy has been studied in the context of entangled gaussian states @xcite . 
 so far we have discussed about the measurement of entanglement in a bipartite pure state . 
 if the composite system is in a mixed state ( defined by the density operator @xmath20 ) , the entanglement of formation @xmath21 can be defined in terms of the average von neumann entropies of the pure states of the decompositions @xcite . 
 wootters has shown the quantity @xmath21 to be an explicit function of @xmath20 @xcite . 
 he has introduced the notion of concurrence in this context . 
 we further notice that from the schmidt decomposition of a pure bipartite state , one can properly identify the entanglement present in the state @xcite . 
 this is also very useful to study bipartite continuous systems @xcite . on the other hand , for a mixed state @xmath20 , the separability criterion has been proposed @xcite to study entanglement . 
 this is based on positive partial transpose mapping of @xmath20 . 
 thus the negativity ( entanglement monotone ) of the eigenvalues of the partial transpose of @xmath20 could be a measure of entanglement in a mixed bipartite system @xcite . 
 the concept of negativity as an entanglement measure has been used in context of interaction of atoms with thermal field @xcite . 
 the separability criterion has been extended to continuous systems @xcite also .    despite many approaches to define entanglement for a bipartite system , 
 there have been only a few approaches to quantify entanglement in the composite systems of three or more particles @xcite . 
 we note that a generalization of schmidt decomposition in multipartite systems in pure states has been introduced @xcite . 
 @xcite proposed a measurement of entanglement in a tripartite system in terms of concurrences of the pairs of subsystems . 
 this measure is invariant under permutations of the subsystems . 
 an average entanglement in a four - partite entangled state has been defined in terms of von neumann entropies of the pairs of subsystems @xcite . 
 very recently , yukalov has addressed the question more generally and quantified multipartite entanglement @xcite in terms of the ratio of norms of an entangling operator and of a disentangling operator in the relevant disentangled hilbert space .    in this paper 
 , we put forward a possible measurement of entanglement of a four - particle system by studying the entropy of the reduced three - particle system . 
 as mentioned above , the von neumann entropy is a good measure for entanglement in a bipartite system . for a tripartite composite state , 
 this entropy satisfies a strong subadditivity inequality ( ssi ) @xcite , which has many important implications in the subject of quantum information theory . in this paper 
 , we study the properties of a four - particle entangled state through the three - particle entropy and the ssi . 
 the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec . 
 ii , we provide a brief discussion on strong subadditivity inequality from the quantum information point of view . in sec . 
 iii , we describe a physical model and show the preparation of a four - particle entangled state . in sec . 
 iv , we study the validity of the ssi in the present context and provide a physical explanation of the results . 
 we conclude this paper by proposing a measurement of the corresponding four - particle entanglement . 
 we have already mentioned that for a bipartite composite system of two particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the joint entropy @xmath11 satisfies the subadditivity inequality ( [ ineq ] ) . for a composite system of three particles a , b , and c , this inequality can be extended to the following form @xcite : @xmath22 this inequality is known as strong subadditivity inequality . the most obvious situation that the equality sign holds in ( [ lieb ] ) is when 
 the composite density matrix @xmath23 can be written as the tensor product of its three reduced density matrices as @xmath24 , i.e. , when the system is in a disentangled state . 
 however , the more stringent condition for this reads as @xcite @xmath25    there have been numerous implications of the above inequality ( [ lieb ] ) in quantum information theory @xcite . 
 firstly , it refers to the fact that the conditioning on the subsystem always reduces the entropy , i.e. , @xmath26 , where , @xmath27 is the entropy of a conditional on knowing the state of b. secondly , the above inequality implies that discarding a quantum system never increases mutual information , i.e. , @xmath28 , where , @xmath29 is the mutual information of the subsystems a and b. thirdly , quantum operations never increase mutual information of two subsystems . 
 this means that if the mutual information of the two subsystems a and b becomes @xmath30 after trace - preserving operation on b , then @xmath31 . 
 further , this inequality ( [ lieb ] ) implies that the conditional entropy of the subsystems a , b , and c is also subadditive , i.e. , @xmath32 .    to verify ssi 
 , one needs to calculate the entropies like @xmath33 which clearly requires a three - particle mixed state which we can produce using a pure four - particle entangled state @xcite . in the next section , 
 we discuss how one can prepare a pure four - particle entangled state so that we can study ssi for the first time for a system realizable using cavity qed methods . 
 we consider two three - level atoms ( a and b ) with relevant energy levels in @xmath0-configuration ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) interacting with a two - mode high quality optical cavity . 
 the specified annihilation operators for the cavity modes are @xmath34 and @xmath35 . 
 the atoms are interacting with the cavity mode @xmath34 in @xmath36 transition and with the mode @xmath35 in @xmath37 transition . 
 the hamiltonian for the system under rotating wave approximation can be written as    @xmath38\;,\ ] ]    where , @xmath39 is the atomic transition frequency between the levels @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath43 is the respective frequency of the cavity modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath44 @xmath43 provides the atom - cavity coupling . 
 we assume @xmath44 s to be real and function of time . 
 we start with the initial state @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the initial numbers of photons in the cavity modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively and the two atoms are in @xmath48 state . 
 the state of the system can be expanded in terms of the relevant basis states in the following way : @xmath49 from the schrdinger equation we find the following equations of the corresponding probability amplitudes : @xmath50\;,\\ \dot{d}_6&=&-i(\sqrt{\mu + 2}g_{2a}d_4+\sqrt{\mu + 2}g_{2b}d_7)\;,\nonumber\\ \dot{d}_7&=&-i(\sqrt{\mu + 1}g_{2a}d_5+\sqrt{\mu + 2}g_{2b}d_6+\delta d_7+\sqrt{n-1}g_{1b}d _ 8)\;,\nonumber\\ \dot{d}_8&=&-i(\sqrt{n-1}g_{1b}d_7+\sqrt{\mu + 1}g_{2a}d_9)\;,\nonumber\\ \dot{d}_9&=&-i(\sqrt{n}g_{1a}d_1+\sqrt{n-1}g_{1b}d_5+\sqrt{\mu + 1}g_{2a}d_8+\delta d_9)\;,\nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] where , we have used the following transformations : @xmath51 where , @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the one - photon detuning of the cavity modes for the @xmath54-th atom . 
 here we have assumed that the cavity modes are in two - photon resonance and @xmath55 .    writing these equations ( [ doteq ] ) in the matrix form @xmath56=-i[m][d_i]$ ] , we find that one of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath57 $ ] is zero . 
 the corresponding eigenstate is @xmath58\ ; , \label{dark}\ ] ]    where @xmath59 clearly , this state is an entangled state of four particles , namely , the atoms a and b , and the two modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 . using appropriate time - dependence of the pulses , 
 the four - particle system can be prepared in this state , as discussed in the next section . 
 recently , there have a few experimental demonstrations of preparation of four - particle entangled state @xcite and performance of a c - not gate @xcite . 
 interestingly , the state @xmath60 is a two - atom two - mode multipartite coherent population trapping ( cpt ) state which is a counterpart of the well - known cpt state for a single atom interacting with two coherent fields @xcite . 
 we next discuss how the state @xmath60 can be prepared by using raman adiabatic passage technique . 
 we assume that both the atoms are initially in @xmath48 state . 
 we further assume the time - dependence of the rabi frequencies @xmath44 of the two modes as @xmath61 here , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) is the amplitude of the respective pulse , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the width and time - separation respectively , of the two pulses . 
 note that the pulses are applied in counterintuitive sequence . under this condition 
 , the atom - cavity system follows the evolution of the state @xmath60 adiabatically . 
 this state is a zero eigenvalue eigenstate ( adiabatic state ) of the hamiltonian ( [ hamil1 ] ) . during this process , known as stimulated raman adiabatic technique ( stirap ) @xcite , 
 the atom - cavity system remains in this state for all times . in the present case , at the end of the evolution , 
 the population of both the atoms are simultaneously transferred to the state @xmath66 . however , if the atoms are not in one - photon resonance , i.e. , if @xmath67 
 , then this transfer process is not complete . 
 this happens because the system does not remain confined in the null adiabatic state @xmath60 for @xmath67 @xcite . 
 we now investigate the validity of ssi for any trio of quantum systems in the present process . 
 we can express this inequality for any three particles , namely , atom a , atom b , and cavity mode @xmath34 with number @xmath46 of photons out of the four - particle system under consideration as @xmath68 here , @xmath69 defines the joint von neumann entropy of the relevant subsystems [ see eq . 
 ( [ entropy ] ) ] . this can be calculated from the state ( [ wavefunc ] ) by tracing over the other subsystems , e.g. , @xmath70 where , @xmath6 is the reduced density matrix of the atoms a and b and is given by @xmath71 we show the time variation of @xmath72 in fig . 
 clearly , @xmath73 never becomes negative during the evolution and thus the ssi ( [ ssi ] ) holds for all times .    from fig . 
 [ fig2 ] , one clearly sees that for @xmath74 , in long time limit , @xmath72 becomes zero . 
 this means that the subsystems ( a , b , and the mode @xmath34 with photon number @xmath46 ) become disentangled . 
 this happens because of complete adiabatic transfer of population to the level @xmath66 of both the atoms at long time limit . 
 the entire process can be written as @xmath75 we have shown the time - variation of the coefficients @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 [ see eq .  ( [ norm ] ) ] in fig .  [ fig3 ] . 
 this figure reveals the above evolution according to the state @xmath60 under the action of the pulses ( [ pulse ] ) . 
 but for @xmath80 , since complete population transfer does not occur , the system remains entangled in the state @xmath81 at long time limit . 
 this is clear from the dashed curve of fig . 
 [ fig2 ] , as the equality @xmath82 no longer holds at this time limit . 
 thus we can recognize the expression @xmath72 [ see eq . 
 ( [ ssi ] ) ] as a measure of four - particle entanglement in the present process . 
 precisely , @xmath83 , where the equality sign holds good for the disentangled states . 
 an increase in value of @xmath72 refers to increase in entanglement . 
 thus , during the evolution , the system gets more entangled for @xmath74 than for @xmath80 . 
 however , at the end of the evolution , the entanglement persists for nonzero @xmath84 . 
 we must emphasize here that , the present definition of entanglement measurement satisfies all the relevant criteria , namely , ( a ) it is semipositive , i.e. , @xmath83 , ( b ) @xmath82 for an disentangled state , and ( c ) the function @xmath73 is continuous in time domain . 
 using our four - particle entanglement , we can also study the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) involving the entropies of two particles , say , atoms a and b. they remain strongly correlated during the evolution , as @xmath18 remains much larger than zero . at the end of the evolution , @xmath18 becomes zero for @xmath85 which means that the subsystems become uncorrelated . 
 in other words , the entanglement between them vanishes . 
 we note in passing that for a four - particle ghz state defined by @xmath86 of four qubits a , b , c , and d , one is led to a three - particle mixed state @xmath23 defined by @xmath87 in this case , @xmath88 . 
 therefore , the parameter @xmath72 in this case becomes zero , as from eq . 
 ( [ ssi ] ) . 
 so we have a counter - example , in which the equality sign in ( [ lieb ] ) holds for an entangled state , too . 
 however , we note that the above state ( [ mix ] ) satisfies the condition ( [ must ] ) and thus the said equality . 
 in conclusion , we have shown for the first time the role of strong subadditivity inequality for entropies in a four - particle composite system . 
 the stimulated raman adiabatic technique has been used to prepare the four - particle entangled state using two three - level atoms initially in their ground states in a two - mode cavity . 
 we further show that the parameter @xmath72 could serve as a possible measurement of entanglement in the four - particle entangled state under consideration .              c. h. bennett , g. brassard , s. popescu , b. schumacher , j. a. smolin , and w. k. wootters , phys .

11,"slowly pulsating b - type supergiants ( spbsg ) have emerged as a new class of pulsating variables after saio et al . 
 ( 2006 ) have detected pulsational frequencies in the most satellite data of the blue supergiant hd 163899 ( b2 ib / ii , klare & neckel 1977 , schmidt & carruthers 1996 ) . 
 saio et al . 
 ( 2006 ) identified 48 frequency peaks in the most light curve and attributed them to g- and p - mode pulsations . because so far only one object of this type is found , the spbsg class is not yet well defined as for the range of effective temperature and luminosity . 
 also the evolutionary status of these pulsators remains unrevealed ; they may be either in the shell hydrogen burning phase as well as after core helium ignition . 
 the finding of saio et al . 
 ( 2006 ) has prompted a few groups ( godart et al . 
 2009 , daszyska - daszkiewicz , ostrowski , pamyatnykh . 2013 ; hereafter d2013 ) to reanalyse pulsation stability in models of b - type stars after the terminal age main sequence ( tams ) and to further studies of spbsg variables . 
 the presence of g - mode pulsations in b - type post - main sequence stars has been explained by a partial reflection of some modes at an intermediate convective zone ( icz ) related to the hydrogen - burning shell or at a chemical gradient zone surrounding the radiative core . 
 however , all studies of these objects published so far are based on the assumption that hd 163899 has not reached the phase of core helium ignition , i.e. , it is in the phase of shell hydrogen burning . 
 this assumption might not necessary be fulfilled , because the blue loop can reach temperatures of early b spectral types . in this paper 
 we calculate models which undergo core helium burning on the blue loop and compare them with models in the hydrogen shell burning phase . 
 the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 
 [ domains ] , we present the new instability domains which include pulsational instability on the blue loops . 
 the effects of opacity , metallicity , overshooting , element diffusion and mass loss on the pulsational instability areas are studied . 
 propagation diagrams and properties of instability parameter and kinetic energy of modes for representative models are described in section [ models ] . in section [ identification ] 
 we construct photometric diagnostic diagrams for the b - type supergiant models and discuss a prospect for mode identification . an attempt to interpret the oscillation spectrum of hd 163899 
 is presented in section [ hd163899 ] . 
 the last section contains conclusions . 
 the evolutionary models were calculated with mesa evolution code ( modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics , paxton et al . 
 2011 , paxton et al . 2013 ) . 
 mesa allows to follow the evolution of massive stars to the pre - supernova phase . our previous calculations ( d2013 ) 
 were limited to the phase before core helium ignition due to the lack of helium burning in warsaw - new jersey evolution code we used . 
 we considered the mass range of 13@xmath318 @xmath0 . 
 all computed models have an initial hydrogen abundance of @xmath4 and agss09 metal mixture ( asplund et al . 
 the initial metal abundance varies from @xmath5 to @xmath6 . 
 opal ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) and op opacity tables ( seaton 2005 ) were used . 
 all effects of rotation were neglected . 
 non - adiabatic pulsation analysis was performed using the code of dziembowski ( 1977 ) . in fig.[fig1 ] we present evolutionary tracks including various effects : opacity , metallicity , overshooting , mass loss and element diffusion . 
 they will be discussed in detail in the following subsections . 
 the convective zones are determined by the ledoux criterion . 
 it seems to be more justified than the schwarzschild criterion because of a direct sensitivity of the chemical gradient to evolution . 
 lebreton et al . 
 ( 2009 ) argued that the use of the ledoux criterion leads to a narrower icz and hence to the smaller number of unstable modes . in case of our models 
 , mesa produces the wide icz with both criterions and this effect is not significant . for the envelope , we adopted the parameter of the mixing length theory ( mlt ) of @xmath7 which is the higher value than usually used for massive stars . during the main sequence ( ms ) and 
 hydrogen - shell burning phases , the value of @xmath8 has a negligible effect on structure of massive stars but on the red giant branch ( rgb ) a higher efficiency of convection is needed and hence we opted for the higher value of @xmath8 . 
 we took into account convective overshooting from the hydrogen and helium core and inward overshooting from non - burning convective zones , using the exponential formula ( herwig 2000 ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the diffusion coefficient derived from mlt at a user - defined location near the boundary of a convective zone , @xmath11 is the pressure scale height at that location , @xmath12 is the distance in the radiative layer away from that location , and @xmath13 is an adjustable parameter , which we set to @xmath14 for most of calculated models . 
 this value of @xmath13 mimics the behaviour of step overshooting with @xmath15 .    in our models 
 the core helium ignition commences on the way towards the rgb but at this stage the energy produced from the helium burning is much lower than the energy produced from the hydrogen shell burning . 
 the shell dominates the evolution up to the tip of rgb . at this point 
 the energy produced in a helium core becomes comparable to the energy from the shell and the luminosity of a star drops . 
 a star might eventually move towards higher effective temperatures and form a blue loop . 
 the behaviour of the blue loops is still very poorly known and it is difficult to predict the effect of different parameters on their properties . 
 we found that the convective overshooting has the most visible effect on their emergence , especially the inward overshooting from the non - burning zone . without that overshooting it is impossible to obtain blue loops in our models independently of metallicity , opacity , diffusion , etc . 
 this effect is shown in fig.[fig2 ] , where we depicted two evolutionary tracks for the mass of 15 @xmath0 calculated with and without inward overshooting from the non - burning zone . 
 the blue loop emerges if the @xmath16-gradient left by the evolution during ms is erased by the outer convective zone on the rgb . 
 the range of this convective zone is increased by the inward overshooting . on the other hand 
 , the overshooting from the hydrogen core generally acts against emerging of the blue loops . 
 we show the effect of different values of the overshooting parameter on the evolutionary tracks in the central - left panel ( @xmath17 ) and in the bottom - left panel ( @xmath18 ) of fig.[fig1 ] . in both cases 
 the blue loops are present but for the lower value of @xmath13 they have a larger extension . 
 if we increase the overshooting only from the hydrogen core to @xmath18 and we leave @xmath17 for the helium core overshooting and the inward overshooting from non - burning zone , the blue loops still emerge but their extension is lower . 
 this is caused mainly by the reduced overshooting from the helium core which decreases the amount of helium available to burn and hence leads to smaller extension of the blue loop .     with ( solid line ) and without ( dashed line ) 
 inward overshooting from the non - burning convective zone . 
 opal opacity tables and metallicity @xmath19 were used.,width=325 ]    the presented examples show that properties of mixing , especially the convective overshooting , have a huge impact on the behaviour of the blue loops . 
 it is difficult to discriminate between different effects but generally it seems that the inward overshooting from the outer convective zone on the rgb is indispensable to obtain blue loops for the models in the studied range of masses . 
 the overshooting from the hydrogen core suspends the emerging of the blue loops and the overshooting from the helium core has a slight effect on their extension .      for the models considered in section2.1 
 , we computed pulsational instability for modes with the degrees @xmath20 . 
 they are shown as thick lines in in fig.[fig1 ] . 
 the top panels show models calculated with @xmath21 and opal ( the top - left panel ) and op opacity tables ( the top - right panel ) . 
 the central panels depicts models calculated for @xmath22 and opal tables without and with mass loss ( the central - left and central - right panels , respectively ) . 
 the bottom - left panel shows the models calculated with @xmath22 , opal tables and convective overshooting parameter @xmath18 . 
 the bottom - right panel depicts models calculated with element diffusion . 
 details of the used mass - loss models and implementation of diffusion are described later in this section . similarly to our previous results ( d2013 ) there is the p- and g - mode instability beyond tams for the models that undergo hydrogen shell burning . 
 most of the unstable modes are non - radial , but the radial fundamental mode is also unstable in hotter models beyond main sequence . 
 the main difference between our current and all previous calculations is the presence of unstable non - radial modes on the blue loops for more massive models ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) . 
 the radial modes are stable in this evolutionary stage in all calculated models . 
 the existence of pulsation instability on the blue loop , as well as the blue loops themselves , depend critically on the metallicity , @xmath25 . with lowering the metallicity 
 the blue loops reach the higher effective temperatures which has a huge impact on pulsation instability . in models with the lower value of @xmath26 
 the driving layer related to the metal opacity bump is located too deep in the star to be effective . on the other hand , the lower value of metallicity the lower the @xmath25 opacity bump . 
 this crucially weakens instability for the ms and h - shell burning models but it seems to have a negligible effect on the instability on the blue loops , especially when compared to the effect of the effective temperature . in models with @xmath27 the instability in the phase before core helium ignition is entirely quenched whereas there are still a lot of unstable modes in the models with very well developed blue loop . 
 the pulsational instability on the blue loops vanishes at @xmath28 . 
 the reason for that is a difference in the internal structure resulting from a presence of an inward overshooting from the nonburning zone in the blue - loop models . 
 the main effect of this overshooting is visible during the evolution on the rgb , but there is also a thin zone of overshooting below the icz . 
 that leads to enrichment of hydrogen in layers just below the icz , which causes a steep increase of the @xmath16-gradient in a thin zone . as a consequence the brunt - visl frequency , @xmath29 , increases as well , what makes trapping of pulsation modes more effective and some of them can be driven by the @xmath1-mechanism operating in the z - bump despite low metallicity . 
 the opposite situation occurs for models with higher metallicities . 
 for example with @xmath6 there is a large instability area beyond ms but there are no unstable modes in the blue loop models , because of too low temperature the blue loops reach . 
 the exceptions are the highest considered masses - @xmath30 for opal opacities and @xmath31 for op opacity tables . for those masses 
 there are a few models on the hottest part of the blue loops that have unstable modes .    for every calculated mass and independently of metallicity or opacity tables we obtained unstable radial modes in the cooler models on the red giant branch or its vicinity . 
 this result is similar to the one from saio et al . 
 ( 2013 ) and it was expected because in this area of hr diagram a classical instability strip is located . 
 those models are high - mass classical cepheids , in which the pulsations are driven in a region of the second ionization of helium . 
 it is important to note that there are two effects that make the pulsational code we use unsuitable for such stars : the linear approximation and the lack of convection - pulsation interaction . 
 we use the convective flux freezing approximation which is not adequate in large outer convective zones . we do not study properties of these stars to any further extent in this paper . 
 ( solid lines ) and and the lamb frequencies , @xmath32 , for @xmath33 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath34 ( dotted lines ) , as a function of @xmath35 , for model1 ( top panel ) and model2 ( bottom panel ) . 
 the scales of @xmath26 are different to represent the actual temperature profiles of the models.,title=""fig:"",width=332 ]   ( solid lines ) and and the lamb frequencies , @xmath32 , for @xmath33 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath34 ( dotted lines ) , as a function of @xmath35 , for model1 ( top panel ) and model2 ( bottom panel ) . 
 the scales of @xmath26 are different to represent the actual temperature profiles of the models.,title=""fig:"",width=332 ]    as depicted in fig.[fig1 ] , for @xmath21 and @xmath36 there is a large instability strip that covers models both before and after core helium ignition . 
 a comparison of the top- and central - left panels gives the effect of metallicity . 
 for @xmath21 ( top - left panel ) , the range of effective temperatures that covers unstable models on the blue loop is a little wider than for @xmath22 ( central - left panel ) . 
 this is a consequence of a larger extension of the loops towards the higher effective temperatures for lower metallicieties . 
 as expected , an increase in @xmath25 results in wider instability area on ms and beyond tams . 
 the upper panels show an effect of opacity tables on instability domains for @xmath21 , but the main conclusions are the same for every tested metallicity . 
 there are significant differences on the ms phase , due to a long - known fact that for op tables instability starts earlier than for opal tables . during the hydrogen shell burning phase and on the blue loop 
 the differences are very subtle . 
 the loops and instability areas have slightly different shapes but generally they are similar for both sources of the opacity data .    in the central panels we compare instability domains for models with @xmath22 calculated without ( the central - left panel ) and with mass loss ( the central - right panel ) . 
 for @xmath37 we used the wind s scheme of vink et al . 
 ( 2001 ) whereas for @xmath38 a recipe of de jager et al . 
 ( 1988 ) was adopted . 
 we do not study very massive models and hence the amount of mass which is lost during the evolution is rather modest . 
 for instance , a star with initial mass of @xmath39 loses only about @xmath40 during the evolution from zams to the point when helium is depleted in its core . 
 the maximum value of the mass - loss rate is reached on the tip of the red giant branch and for the @xmath39 star it has the value of @xmath41 . 
 mass loss seems to have a negligible effect on instability of models immediately beyond tams , whereas this effect on the instability on the blue loops is much more pronounced . with the reduced mass a star reaches lower luminosity during helium burning phase and 
 also a blue loop reaches lower effective temperature than for models calculated without mass loss . 
 both of these effects lead to smaller instability range during this phase of evolution . the description of wind which we used for lower effective temperatures ( de jager et al . 
 ( 1988 ) ) gives relatively low values of mass loss when compared to other models we checked ( nieuwenhuijzen & de jager 1990 , van loon et al . 
 2005 , reimers 1975 ) . 
 it means that the instability areas on the blue loops calculated with other mass - loss models would be even smaller or entirely vanished . 
 also with sufficiently high mass loss the blue loops do not emerge at all . 
 we will not discuss effects of mass loss anymore in this paper because they do not change any qualitative results presented here . despite this 
 it has to be remembered that it is a common phenomenon and it should be enabled during construction of detailed asteroseismic models . 
 the bottom - left panel depicts the instability areas calculated for higher value of convective overshooting , @xmath18 . 
 the most important difference when compared to models with @xmath17 ( central - left panel ) is smaller extension of the blue loops and hence there are no unstable models present during this evolutionary phase .    in the bottom - right panel of fig.[fig1 ] we present models calculated with @xmath22 , opal opacity tables and element diffusion . 
 mesa calculates element diffusion by solving burgler s equations using the method and diffusion coefficients of thoul et al . 
 the effect of diffusion on the shape of evolution tracks and instability areas is negligible , both for models before and after core helium ignition . 
 the small changes of abundances of chemical elements in the central regions of the star do not modify significantly a behaviour of pulsation modes . 
 the minor differences of frequencies might be important during a comparison to the observations but they do not influence the qualitative results presented here . 
 here , we compare pulsation properties of two representative models with similar positions in the h - r diagram but in two different evolutionary stages , one during the shell hydrogen burning phase ( @xmath39 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , hereafter model1 ) and the second during core helium burning ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , hereafter model2 ) . they are calculated with opal opacity tables , agss09 metal mixture and @xmath19 . 
 propagation of pulsational modes in the radial direction is confined to the regions determined by the two characteristic frequencies ( e.g. , unno et al . 
 1989 ) , i.e. , the lamb ( acoustic ) frequency ( @xmath47 ) and brunt - visl ( buoyancy ) frequency ( @xmath48 ) . 
 the values of @xmath47 depend mostly on the mode degree , @xmath49 , whereas the brunt - visl frequency is very sensitive to the structure of a star ( e.g. , a presence of convective zones or chemical gradients ) .    in fig.[fig3 ] 
 , we present propagation diagrams , i.e. , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , for models 1 and 2 ( the top and bottom panels , respectively ) . the main difference between these models is the presence of a convective core ( @xmath52 ) in the model on the blue loop , whereas the model that undergoes shell hydrogen burning has a radiative core . beyond the core , 
 the propagation diagrams of these two models are qualitatively similar ; in particular , both have a fully developed intermediate convective zone . 
 the two spikes in the run of brunt - visl frequency that occur in the vicinity of convective zones in model2 have different origin . 
 the one at the border of the convective core is both a consequence of the very steep @xmath16-gradient in this region of star ( the main reason ) and also a numerical effect related to the extreme difficulties with precise determination of the border of helium core by evolution codes . due to a very high sensitivity of triple - alpha process to a change of temperature , the location of border changes slightly with every step of evolution . 
 that results in an artificial increase of the @xmath16-gradient , which is clearly visible in behaviour of @xmath29 . 
 the second spike , at the innermost border of icz is related to the presence of inward overshooting from this convective zone . 
 that leads to a steep change of @xmath16 and a peak in the propagation diagram .    in fig.[fig4 ] , we present the instability parameter , @xmath53 , for modes with the harmonic spherical degrees @xmath54 , as a function of frequency for models 1 and 2 ( the top and bottom panels respectively ) . 
 instability parameter measures the net energy gained by a mode during one pulsational cycle and is defined as ( stellingwerf 1978 ) :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the global work integral . 
 this definition gives normalization @xmath57 $ ] . if @xmath58 a pulsation mode is unstable and if @xmath59 it is stable . 
 there are two global maxima of @xmath53 in model1 , which is similar to the behaviour during the ms evolution ( d2013 ) . the first one , at low frequencies , 
 is related to the very high - order g - modes , while the second one , at higher frequencies , is related to the low - order p- and g - modes . all non - radial modes in the second group are mixed modes and they behave like p - modes only in the outer envelope of the star . in the frequency range presented in fig.[fig4 ] , 
 i.e. , from 0.04 to 3.5 d@xmath60 , the values of the radial order , @xmath61 , are in ranges of about @xmath62 for the @xmath33 modes and @xmath63 for the @xmath34 modes . in model1 the fundamental radial mode and the first overtone are unstable with the ratio of periods @xmath64 . 
 the most interesting behaviour of @xmath53 is visible in the vicinity of the first maximum . 
 there is a clearly visible pattern of consecutive local minima and maxima , which does not occur in ms models . 
 this phenomenon is related to the partial trapping of pulsation modes in the radiative core and the envelope . 
 the detailed description of this phenomenon can be found in our previous paper ( d2013 ) .    in model2 , which burns helium in its core 
 , a situation is different . 
 there are only a few very high - order low - frequency g - modes which are unstable . 
 these maximum values of @xmath53 are shifted towards lower frequencies when compared to model1 . 
 there is no pattern of local minima and maxima and the calculated frequency spectrum is much sparser than for model1 . 
 this is typical for every blue - loop that a number of unstable modes is very low . 
 model2 has one unstable dipole mode with frequencies of @xmath65 c / d and two unstable quadruple modes with frequencies @xmath66 c / d . 
 radial modes are always stable in models during core helium burning phase , regardless of metallicity , opacity tables , etc . 
 however , the ratio of periods between the first overtone and the fundamental mode is visibly lower than in model1 and has a value @xmath67 . in model2 , 
 the radial orders of pulsation modes are much larger , in particular for the quadruple mode . 
 for the considered range of @xmath68 , cf . 
 fig.[fig4 ] , the values of @xmath61 are : @xmath69 for @xmath33 and @xmath70 for @xmath34 .    in fig.[fig5 ] 
 , we compare the kinetic energy densities , @xmath71 ( top panels ) , and differential work integrals , @xmath72 ( bottom panels ) , for unstable and stable modes of the degree @xmath34 with very close frequencies . the left group of panels is for model1 ( before core helium ignition ) and the left group of panels for model2 ( after core helium ignition ) . 
 the behaviour of presented modes is typical and representative for all unstable and stable modes during shell hydrogen burning and on the blue loops . 
 the properties of pulsational modes in the shell hydrogen burning model have been already presented in d2013 but for comparative purposes we repeat them here .    in model1 , both unstable ( @xmath73 c / d , @xmath74 ) and stable ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) modes exhibit a very strong damping in the radiative helium core , which is visible in the behaviour of @xmath72 in the bottom panels of the left group . 
 as shown in the upper panels of this group , most of the kinetic energy of the modes is confined in the central region . 
 the most notable difference between the presented modes is that the unstable one has some energy deposited also in the radiative envelope , whereas the stable one has almost no energy in this region . 
 this is due to the fact that the unstable mode has been partially reflected at the icz and is trapped in two cavities : the core and the outer layers . 
 that energy , although its amount is small when compared to the amount trapped in the core , is sufficient for the @xmath1 mechanism , operating in the @xmath2bump , to efficiently drive the pulsations . 
 this is visible in the behaviour of differential work integral - there is a maximum around @xmath77 and it dominates over the damping in the core . on the contrary , 
 the stable mode has not been reflected at icz because it does not have a node of eigenfunction there . 
 that means that it penetrates the core with high amplitude and is effectively damped there . 
 the above behaviour of @xmath71 explains the pattern of local maxima and minima of @xmath53 described earlier on .    for model2 
 we also compare two very close modes : the unstable one with @xmath78 c / d and @xmath79 and the stable one with @xmath80 c / d and @xmath81 . their kinetic energy densities and differential work integrals are shown in the right group of panels in fig.[fig5 ] . 
 the behavior of @xmath71 is different for these modes than for the modes from the model1 . 
 the entire energy of the stable mode is confined to the radiative zone in - between the convective core and the icz ( there is strong damping in this region of the star ) , whereas the unstable mode has almost all of its energy trapped in the outer radiative zone . 
 that means that the unstable modes of the blue loop models have to be almost entirely reflected at the icz . 
 this fact might be the explanation why we do have far fewer unstable modes from models burning helium in its core than from models before core helium ignition and also the lack of the structure of @xmath53 observed in model1 . 
 the behaviour of kinetic energy density depicted in fig.[fig5 ] is typical for all unstable and stable modes both during hydrogen shell burning and on the blue loops . 
 in our previous paper ( d2013 ) , we have shown that one should not expect regular patterns in the oscillation spectra of blue supergiants which the asymptotic theory predicts for g - mode pulsations . however , it turned out that there is a prospect for identification of the degree , @xmath49 , for modes excited in the blue supergiant models before core helium ignition from photometric diagnostic diagrams ( d2013 ) . here 
 , we will check whether the photometric amplitudes and phases of pulsations in models after core helium ignition have similar properties . 
 the expression for the complex amplitudes of the light variations in a given passband within the linear and zero - rotation approximation can be found , e.g. , in daszyska - daszkiewicz et al . 
 ( 2002 ) , and need not be repeated here . to compute the values of these observables 
 , we used the nonadiabatic pulsational code of dziembowski ( 1977 ) and tables of the fluxes in photometric passbands and nonlinear limb - darkening coefficients computed by daszyska - daszkiewicz & szewczuk ( 2011 ) on the basis of the nlte atmosphere models of lanz & hubeny ( 2007 ) .    in fig.[fig6 ] , we show positions of unstable modes with the degree @xmath82 excited in the supergiant models in the photometric diagnostic diagrams employing the @xmath83 and @xmath84 johnson filters . 
 these passbands are similar to those used on the bright - star target explorer constellation ( brite ) which is already operating . 
 we used the opal data for the agss09 mixture and @xmath22 . in the left panel we marked positions of all unstable modes in models with masses @xmath85 whereas in the right panel we chose modes excited in models with @xmath86 and @xmath87 . 
 these temperature range is a typical maximum error and larger than the error for hd 163899 ( saio et al . 
 2006 ) . with different symbols we discriminate between different values of @xmath49 and evolutionary stages . 
 their meanings are described in the legend of the plots .    in the diagram for 
 all studied masses , there is a perfect separation between radial and non - radial modes and fairly good separation between dipoles and quadruples . 
 a discrimination between models undergoing shell hydrogen burning and models on the blue loops is not obvious . 
 modes excited in models on these evolution stages tend to group in slightly different locations but in a plot including such a range of masses their distinction would be uncertain given observational errors in the photometric amplitudes and phases . 
 the situation improves slightly when we are able to constrain the mass and effective temperature . after fixing the range of @xmath26 in the right panel of fig.[fig6 ] , 
 the separation between phases before and after core helium ignition can be noticeable . 
 fig.[fig7 ] presents how the photometric observables depend on the mode frequency considering again the br johnson passbands and the same models as in the right panel of fig.[fig6 ] . from this plot 
 we can conclude that much better separation between modes of different values of @xmath49 , from both the amplitude ratios and phase differences , occurs for higher frequency modes which are unstable only in model1 . 
 and @xmath88 , respectively . 
 the models have been calculated with @xmath21 and opal opacity tables . 
 the grey area depicts the error of @xmath26 for hd 163899 ( saio et al . 
 2006).,width=332 ]    the greatest uncertainty concerning spbsg stars is their evolutionary status . 
 although the basic parameters ( @xmath26 , @xmath89 , @xmath25 , @xmath90 , etc . ) of hd 163899 are very poorly determined or unknown , our calculations still can give some insights about the star . in fig.[fig8 
 ] , we present a comparison of evolution times in the pulsational unstable region of hr diagram during shell hydrogen burning phase and on the blue loop , for models with masses @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , and @xmath21 . 
 the star spends only a very short time ( about 8 000 years ) in the instability strip during the shell - hydrogen burning phase compared to the time spent on the unstable region of the blue loop ( about 800 000 years ) . 
 there should be much more stars in the region of hr diagram occupied by blue supergiants that undergo core helium burning than stars that moves towards red giant branch ( rgb ) . 
 on the one hand , this is the main and only argument why spbsg stars should be on the blue loop . on the other hand , hd 163899 
 is the only know star of this type and we might be very lucky to catch it during the very short phase of pulsational instability before core helium ignition 
 . other arguments also prefer this evolutionary stage . 
 the instability area during a crossing towards rgb is wider in @xmath93 than on the blue loop . 
 this is especially important when we take into account the effect of mass loss which is ubiquitous effect for massive stars . in such a case 
 the instability area on the blue loops become very small . 
 the most important argument is a number of excited modes ; there is much more unstable modes in models during the shell - hydrogen burning phase than in models on the blue loop . 
 the last argument against the evolution on the blue loop is a complete lack of unstable high - frequency modes in this phase . 
 such modes are present in the spectrum of hd 163899 and they are present in our models before core helium ignition .    in fig.[fig9 ] , we compare the oscillation spectrum of hd 163899 ( top panel ) and the theoretical one computed for a model in the shell - hydrogen burning phase ( @xmath53 vs. @xmath68 , bottom panel ) . 
 pulsational modes with the degree up to @xmath94 were considered . 
 this is one of models in which the larger number of pulsation modes are excited . 
 the observed spectrum consists of 48 frequencies between @xmath95 to @xmath96 c / d ( c.f . 
 table 1 in saio et al . 
 this range covers both g - modes ( high - order ) and p - modes in post - ms models . 
 there are also frequencies between those two groups which do not occur in pulsation calculations . 
 we do not know @xmath90 for the star and hence we do not include rotation in our calculations . 
 this is left for the future work . 
 the estimated critical velocity for model1 , which has the stellar radius @xmath97 , is @xmath98 km / s which corresponds to the critical rotation frequency of about @xmath99 c / d . 
 it is very unlikely that a supergiant would rotate at such a high rate , but even with lower rotation rate the very low dominant frequency , @xmath100 c / d , could be explained by retrograde modes . 
 the rotational splitting could also solve the biggest problem of our pulsation models which is too low number of unstable g - modes . 
 as for the observed range of frequencies which occur between the theoretical g- and p - mode maxima , it could be filled in with the high @xmath49 modes of various azimuthal orders , @xmath101 . 
 our goal was to study pulsational properties of b - type supergiants with masses @xmath102 , especially to check the possibility whether spbsg stars can undergo core helium burning . 
 in addition to previously known spbsg instability strip ( saio et al . 
 2006 , d2013 ) which covers the stars that move towards rgb after departure from ms , we found the instability strip for the blue - loop models for the temperatures of b spectral types . 
 its width depends on the extension and shape of the blue loops and hence it varies with many parameters , especially with metallicity , overshooting and mass loss . 
 one of the most important results of our paper is the fact that an inward overshooting from the outer convective zone on the rgb phase is indispensable for the emergence of blue loops at all . 
 the lower values of metallicity in the main sequence and shell hydrogen burning models acts towards decreasing pulsational instability whereas in the case of the blue loops models the most important factor is the effective temperature . for lower values of @xmath25 
 the blue loops have larger extension and the driving layer is located at the proper place for pulsation to be excited . 
 we found unstable modes in the blue loop models with metallicity as low as @xmath103 . 
 there is a difference in behaviour of instability parameter , @xmath53 , between models before and after core helium ignition . as we previously shown ( d2013 ) , in models during shell - hydrogen burning phase 
 there are two groups of unstable mods ; one related to the very high - order g - modes and the second related to the p - mode behaviour . on the contrary , in models on the blue loops 
 only the very high - order g - modes are unstable and the number of unstable modes is much lower than in models that departed from tams and move towards rgb . 
 that might be explained by the difference in the kinetic energy density distribution between those two evolutionary phases . in models that undergo shell hydrogen burning , 
 only a partial reflection of pulsation mode at the icz is sufficient to efficiently drive the mode , whereas on the blue loop the mode has to be almost entirely reflected in order to be unstable .    comparing the properties of models before and after core helium ignition and frequencies detected in the light curve of hd 163899 
 , we drew a conclusion that spbsg stars should rather undergo shell hydrogen burning and not core helium burning on the blue loop . 
 however , to fully support this statement a better determination of basic parameters of hd 163899 is needed and , in the next step , seismic model of the stars should be constructed taking into account the effects of rotation . 
 we found also that mode identification from multicolour photometry is applicable to spbsg stars and hence multi - colour photometry for hd 163899 would be desirable . 
 the analysis of such data could finally lead to constraining the evolutionary status of the star and help to understand pulsations of spbsg stars .

 we address two important questions . the first one deals with one of the most unresolved problems in astrophysics , i.e. , the existence of a blue loop after core helium ignition ; the so called `` to loop or not to loop '' problem .

 we address two important questions . the first one deals with one of the most unresolved problems in astrophysics , i.e. , the existence of a blue loop after core helium ignition ; the so called `` to loop or not to loop '' problem .

 [ firstpage ]    stars : early - type  stars : supergiants  stars : oscillations",we took into account convective overshooting from the hydrogen and helium core and inward overshooting from non burning convective zones using the exponential formula herwig 2000 where is the diffusion coefficient derived from mlt at a user defined location near the boundary of a convective zone is the pressure scale height at that location is the distance in the radiative layer away from that location and is an adjustable parameter which we set to for most of calculated models.  2006 apj 650 1111 saio h georgy c meynet g 2013 mnras 433 1246 schmidt e g carruthers g r 1996 apjs 104 101 seaton m j 2005 mnras 362 l1 stellingwerf r f 1978 aj 83 1184 thoul a a bahcall j n loeb a 1994 apj 421 828 unno w osaki y ando h saio h shibahashi h 1989 nonradial oscillations of stars tokyo university of tokyo press vink j s de koter a lamers h j g l m 2001 a a 369 574. the entire energy of the stable mode is confined to the radiative zone in between the convective core and the icz there is strong damping in this region of the star whereas the unstable mode has almost all of its energy trapped in the outer radiative zone. the lower values of metallicity in the main sequence and shell hydrogen burning models acts towards decreasing pulsational instability whereas in the case of the blue loops models the most important factor is the effective temperature. comparing the properties of models before and after core helium ignition and frequencies detected in the light curve of hd 163899 we drew a conclusion that spbsg stars should rather undergo shell hydrogen burning and not core helium burning on the blue loop. the one at the border of the convective core is both a consequence of the very steep in this region of star the main reason and also a numerical effect related to the extreme difficulties with precise determination of the border of helium core by evolution codes. the presence of g mode pulsations in b type post main sequence stars has been explained by a partial reflection of some modes at an intermediate convective zone icz related to the hydrogen burning shell or at a chemical gradient zone surrounding the radiative core. on the contrary in models on the blue loops only the very high order g modes are unstable and the number of unstable modes is much lower than in models that departed from tams and move towards rgb. in models that undergo shell hydrogen burning only a partial reflection of pulsation mode at the icz is sufficient to efficiently drive the mode whereas on the blue loop the mode has to be almost entirely reflected in order to be unstable.  lebreton y 2009 mnras 396 1833 herwig f 2000 a a 360 952 iglesias c a rogers f j 1996 apj 464 943 de jager c nieuwenhuijzen h van der hucht k a 1988 a as 72 259 klare g neckel t 1977 a as 27 215 lanz t hubeny i 2007 apjs 169 83 lebreton y montalbn j godart m et al,0.33519553072625696,0.12605042016806725,0.15642458100558657
12,"binary systems , whose behavior crucially depends on the underlying condition of immiscibility or miscibility @xcite , play a fundamentally important role in many areas of physics . in the case of immiscibility , a major effect is the formation of domain walls ( dws ) between regions occupied by immiscible components . commonly known are dws in media featuring a vectorial order parameter , such as ferromagnets @xcite , ferroelectrics @xcite , and liquid crystals @xcite . in self - defocusing optical media , 
 dws separate regions occupied by electromagnetic waves with orthogonal circular polarizations of light haelt , me . 
 similar interface patterns were predicted in arrays of nonlinear optical waveguides , modeled by discrete nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nlses ) @xcite . 
 dws are known in superfluids too , where they are formed by immiscible binary bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , as predicted theoretically @xcite and demonstrated in experiments @xcite . in the mean - field approximation @xcite , 
 such settings are modeled by systems of nonlinearly coupled gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) with the cubic self - repulsive nonlinearity , which are similar to coupled nlses describing the above - mentioned optical dws @xcite . in their stationary form , these equations coincide with coupled cubic ginzburg - landau equations modeling dws in dissipative patterns , such as interfaces between rolls with different orientations in large - area rayleigh - benard convection @xcite .    the analysis of the dws in bec was extended for broader settings , including linear interconversion between the immiscible components  ( this is possible when they represent two different hyperfine states of the same atom coupled by a resonant radiofrequency wave ) @xcite , dipolar @xcite and spinor ( three - component ) condensates @xcite , as well as the bec discretized by trapping in a deep optical - lattice ( ol ) potentials mering . 
 furthermore , the study of the dws was recently extended for immiscible binary becs  with three - particle collisions @xcite , in the case when the related losses may be neglected , the respective coupled gpes featuring the cubic - quintic repulsive nonlinearity @xcite .    in the 
 effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) setting , ultracold bosonic gases with strong inter - atomic repulsion may be cast in the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) state , which emulates the gas of non - interacting fermions @xcite , provided that the energy of the repulsive interaction between bosons exceeds their kinetic energy , while the opposite situation corresponds to the becphase in the bosonic gas ( a review of the tg model was given in ref . 
 the tg gas of hard - core bosons has been realized experimentally , using tight transverse confinement @xcite . 
 in particular , a longitudinal ol potential was used to increase the effective mass in the trapped state , thus making the kinetic energy small enough @xcite . 
 it is commonly known that gpes furnish very accurate description of the bec in atomic gases . a similar macroscopic model of the tg gas 
 is offered by the nlse with the quintic self - repulsion term @xcite . in a rigorous form , the relevance of the corresponding sextic term in the free - energy density of the three - dimensional bosonic gas in its ground state , which reduces to the quasi-1d tg phase , was demonstrated in ref . 
 @xcite , under condition @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are , respectively , the inter - atomic repulsion strength , system s length , and the total number o atoms . 
 the quintic model was used in various contexts , including shock waves @xcite , dark @xcite and gap - mode @xcite solitons , as well as bright solitons supported by dipole - dipole interactions @xcite , and , recently , dws in immiscible binary tg gases @xcite . 
 further , oscillation frequencies derived from fermionic hydrodynamic equations , which apply to the hard - core tg gas , were found to be close to their counterparts predicted by the quintic nlse hydro . 
 coupled quintic nlses also arise in works aimed at constructing the ground state of a binary tg mixture in the harmonic - oscillator potential by means of the density - functional method @xcite . on the other hand , this approach may not apply to tg gases beyond the framework of static configurations and hydrodynamic regimes . in particular 
 , it fails for strongly non - equilibrium problems , such as merger of distinct gas clouds @xcite . 
 as concerns the mixtures , it may be interesting to consider binary systems including the tg gas and another quantum - gas component . 
 in particular , exact solutions  were found for the ground state of tg - fermi mixtures minguzzi . 
 the binary gas of impenetrable bosons is solvable too ctg - ba . 
 the objective of the present work is to introduce basic nonlinear complexes , such as dws , bubble - drop ( bd ) modes ( bound pairs of two dws ) , and dark - bright solitons ( dbss ) , in an immiscible system of tg and bec gases . in the experiment , the system may be realized , in particular , as a bosonic gas composed of two atomic species under tight transverse confinement , with a longitudinal ol potential acing on ( being relatively close to a resonance with ) one species only . 
 then , as the experimental setting presented in ref . 
 @xcite suggests , a large effective mass of the near - resonant component will bring it into the tg state , while the other component may stay in the bec phase .    as a model for this system , in section ii we adopt the cubic gpe for the self - repulsive bec component coupled by the cubic ( collisional ) repulsive term to the quintic nlse for the tg species . 
 the use of the latter equation is appropriate , as we study only static configurations of the system . 
 the same model may find a realization in optics as a model of colloidal waveguides . 
 it has been recently demonstrated that , selecting the size of metallic nanoparticles in the colloid and their concentration , one can engineer desirable coefficients of the corresponding cubic and quintic nonlinearity @xcite . in particular , it is possible to design a waveguide which features a nearly pure quintic nonlinearity at a particular wavelength , while the cubic response dominates at a different wavelength . 
 the copropagation of optical signals carried by these wavelengths will then emulate the tg - bec system . 
 dws separating the bec and tg phases are addressed in section iii . 
 we derive the respective immiscibility condition ( see eq . ( [ g < ] ) below ) , and then generate dw states in a systematic way , using both numerical solutions and the analytical thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) . 
 the latter method makes it possible to obtain some dws in an explicit analytical form , as given below by eqs . 
 ( [ exact ] ) - ( [ wtfa ] ) . 
 db and dbs complexes are considered in sections iv and v , respectively , again using a combination of analytical and numerical methods . 
 the analysis predicts that the db states exist solely in the form of the tg drop embedded into the bec background ( bubble ) , but not in the opposite case ; on the other hand , the dbs are predicted in either case of the bright tg soliton embedded into the bec dark soliton , or vice versa . 
 these predictions are fully corroborated by numerical results . 
 the paper is concluded by section vi . 
 the system of coupled nlses with the cubic and quintic nonlinear terms for the bec and tg components , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with respective scaled masses @xmath6 and @xmath7(i.e . 
 , @xmath8 is the relative effective mass of tg components which , as said above , may be made larger than the actual atomic mass @xcite ) is @xmath9where real parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are strengths of the self - repulsion of the bec component , and repulsion between the bec and tg ones , respectively , while @xmath12 and the coefficient of the effective quintic self - repulsion of the tg component are scaled to be @xmath13 ( in the notation of ref . 
 @xcite , the natural value of the latter coefficient is @xmath14 ) . 
 substitution @xmath15makes it possible to further fix @xmath16 and @xmath17 , thus simplifying eq . 
 ( [ first ] ) to a system with two free coefficients , @xmath8 and @xmath18:@xmath19    for the above - mentioned spatial - domain optical model ( with @xmath20 replaced by the propagation distance , @xmath21 , and transverse coordinate @xmath22 ) , the scaled propagation equations are derived , using the standard procedure @xcite , as@xmath23here @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent amplitudes of the copropagating electromagnetic waves with relative wavenumber and frequency @xmath26 and @xmath27 , cf . 
 ( [ mmm ] ) . 
 further , @xmath28 in eq . 
 ( [ omega ] ) are the cubic and quintic spm coefficients for the two waves , while the cubic xpm coefficient is normalized to be @xmath13 
 . additional rescaling,@xmath29transforms eq . 
 ( [ omega ] ) into the system of equations ( [ bec ] ) and ( [ tg ] ) , with @xmath30 . 
 the hamiltonian corresponding to eqs . 
 ( [ bec ] ) and ( [ tg ] ) is @xmath31 in addition to @xmath32 , the system preserves the norms ( scaled numbers of atoms in the ultracold gas , or total powers of the two waves , in terms of the optical model ) , @xmath33of the two components , and , for dynamical solutions , also the total momentum , @xmath34 , although , as mentioned above , the use of the quintic nls equation for the description of dynamics of the tg gas may be impugnable . 
 stationary solutions to eqs . 
 ( [ bec ] ) and ( [ tg ] ) with positive chemical potentials @xmath35 are looked for as @xmath36with real functions @xmath37 satisfying equations @xmath38(in the optical model , @xmath39 represent the propagation constants of the two waves ) . 
 equations ( [ phi1 ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) , if considered as equations of the evolution along @xmath40 , conserve the formal hamiltonian,@xmath41cf . 
 ( [ h ] ) .    normalizing the stationary wave functions as@xmath42one may fix @xmath43 , which implies that the density of the uniform tg component is also fixed to be @xmath13 , see eq . 
 ( [ bc ] ) below . 
 numerical results for dws are presented in the following section chiefly for this case , while in sections iv and v  other normalizations are used for bd and dbs states . 
 solutions of stationary equations ( [ phi1 ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) for the domain wall ( dw ) separating semi - infinite domains occupied by the bec and tg components ( or the spatial domains occupied by the copropagating waves in the above - mentioned optics model ) are specified by the following boundary conditions ( b.c . ) , which include the respective asymptotic densities , @xmath44 and @xmath45 : @xmath46the condition that formal hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) must take the same values at @xmath47 and @xmath48 across the solution imposes a restriction on b.c . ( 
 [ bc ] ) , which relates the two chemical potentials:@xmath49 in terms of the asymptotic densities , condition ( [ bc ] ) takes the form of@xmath50which actually implies the balance of the pressure applied to the dw from the two sides . 
 naturally , the mass ratio ( @xmath8 ) does not appear in eqs . 
 ( mumu ) and ( [ nn ] ) . 
 note that , if condition ( [ nn ] ) between the densities does not hold initially , the dw in a finite system , which corresponds to real experimental settings , will move to a position at which the condition holds for the accordingly modified densities . 
 further , the _ immiscibility condition _ for the bec  and tg , which is necessary for the existence of the dw separating the two quantum gases , is that the demixed configuration must provide a _ 
 smaller _ energy density ( defined as per eq . 
 ( [ h ] ) ) than a uniformly mixed state with densities which are equal to half of asymptotic densities ( [ bc]):@xmath51the uniform state corresponds to values of the chemical potentials different from @xmath52 and @xmath53 , namely , @xmath54 , @xmath55 . 
 then , the comparison of the average energy densities of the demixed and uniform states gives rise to the immiscibility condition in the following form : @xmath56further , the substitution of relation ( [ mumu ] ) in eq . 
 ( [ < ] ) transforms it into an inequality for the self - repulsion strength of the bec component , @xmath18 : @xmath57 in particular , for @xmath43 ( as said above , this value will be fixed by rescaling ) , eq . 
 ( [ g < ] ) yields @xmath58 . 
 the dw may be characterized by an effective width of its core , which may be naturally defined by the following integral expression : @xmath59the analysis should produce @xmath60 as a function of parameters @xmath8 and @xmath18 , once the tg asymptotic density is fixed by setting @xmath43 , see fig . 
 [ fig : wvsm ] below . 
 close to the existence boundary of the dw , i.e. , at @xmath61 , the dw becomes very wide . in this limit 
 , the dependence between the width and proximity to the threshold may be estimated as follows : the density of the gradient energy in eq . 
 ( [ h ] ) scales as @xmath62 , hence the full gradient energy scales as @xmath63 , and the respective effective force may be estimated as @xmath64 @xmath65 . 
 it must be balanced by the effective bulk force vanishing at @xmath66 , which scales as @xmath67 . 
 thus , the equilibrium condition predicts that the dw s width diverges at @xmath68 as@xmath69    accurate analytical results for the dw can be obtained in the limit case corresponding to @xmath70 , or to @xmath71 , when the derivative term in eq . 
 ( [ phi1 ] ) may be neglected ( which actually implies the use of the tfa book ) , yielding@xmath72strictly speaking , the assumption of @xmath71 may contradict the experimentally relevant way of the realization of the tg gas , based on making the respective effective mass large @xcite . 
 nevertheless , the other option justifying the applicability of the tfa , @xmath70 , is quite relevant .    the substitution of expressions ( [ 1/g ] ) and ( [ mumu ] ) in eq . 
 ( phi2 ) leads to the single stationary equation for @xmath73 , with the cubic - quintic nonlinearity:@xmath74(eq . 
 ( [ mumu ] ) was used here to eliminate @xmath52 ) . 
 then , using a known particular exact solution for the dw solution of eq . 
 ( [ single ] ) @xcite , we obtain a solution at the following values of the chemical potentials:@xmath75i.e . , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , in the form of@xmath78note that @xmath79 satisfies condition ( g < ) , and rescaling ( [ tilde ] ) transforms values ( [ exact ] ) into @xmath80 . the width of this solution , defined according to eq . 
 ( [ w ] ) , is@xmath81comparison of analytical solution ( [ dw ] ) with its numerical counterpart is displayed below in fig . 
 [ fig : exact ] .    an analytical approach can also be developed in the opposite limit of @xmath82 ( very heavy tg atoms ) , when the tfa may be applied to eq . 
 ( [ phi2 ] ) ( i.e. , the derivative term may be dropped in this equation ) , reducing it to@xmath83 in this case , eq . 
 ( [ phi1 ] ) takes the form of@xmath84cf . 
 ( [ 1/g ] ) and ( [ single ] ) derived above in the opposite limit of @xmath85 . in the particular case of @xmath86 ( no intrinsic interaction in the bec component ) , eq . 
 ( [ phi1nophi2 ] ) coincides with the equation considered in ref . 
 @xcite , in the context of a completely different physical model , for a resonantly absorbing bragg reflector in optics . the formal hamiltonian for eq . 
 ( [ phi1nophi2 ] ) is @xmath87cf . 
 ( [ h ] ) . 
 the dw solution corresponds to a solution of eq . 
 ( phi1nophi2 ) with the b.c . produced by eq . 
 ( [ bc ] ) : @xmath88 , and , simultaneously , @xmath89 , the latter relation following from eq . 
 ( [ phi2phi1 ] . 
 obviously , this b.c . 
 set is self - consistent solely for @xmath90 . in the combination with this relation , equating values of @xmath91 corresponding to @xmath92 and @xmath93 , as per eq . 
 ( [ phi1h ] ) , yields @xmath94 , which is impossible , as @xmath18 can not be negative . 
 thus , the dw solution does not exist in this approximation . 
 nevertheless , it readily produces analytical solutions for complexes of other types , bd and dbs , as shown below . 
 generic dw structures obtained from numerical solutions of eqs . ( [ bec ] ) and ( [ tg ] ) are displayed in fig . 
 [ fig : dw ] . 
 stationary solutions have been obtained by means of the imaginary - time - propagation method . the validity and stability of the solutions 
 was then checked by simulations in real time . 
 the simulations in both imaginary and real time were run by means of the split - step crank - nicholson method @xcite . 
 stable solutions have been found in a wide range of values of @xmath8 at @xmath95 , and no solutions could be obtained at @xmath96 , which is readily explained by eq . 
 ( [ g < ] ) ( recall we set @xmath43 ) . actual numerical results for the dws have been obtained for @xmath97 . in other words , 
 a natural conclusion is that the dw exists if the bec - tg repulsion is stronger than the intrinsic repulsion of the bec component . in the remaining interval of @xmath98 
 ( [ g < ] ) ) , it is difficult to generate dws numerically , as the initial guess for finding the solution by means of the imaginary - time propagation should be very close to the true one , in case the solution is sought for close to its existence boundary . unlike @xmath18 , the dependence of the dw solutions on @xmath8 is very weak , as seen in fig . 
 fig : dw which displays examples for @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( the comparison of the results obtained for large and small values of @xmath8 , presented here and below , is appropriate even if very small values of @xmath8 may be experimentally irrelevant , as mentioned above ) .    ) , ( [ tg ] ) , and subsequently verified by the real - time propagation , for @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and two values of the relative mass , @xmath99 and @xmath104 . in terms of the optics model , 
 the bec and tg densities correspond to power densities of the waves subject to the action of the cubic and quintic self - defocusing nonlinearity , respectively ( in captions to the following figures , they are referred to as  cubic "" and  quintic "" components , respectively).,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    \(a ) ( b )    in addition , fig . 
 [ fig : exact ] displays the comparison of the analytical approximation ( tfa ) based on eqs . 
 ( [ 1/g ] ) , ( [ exact ] ) , and ( [ dw ] ) with the numerical solution obtained for the same values of parameters . 
 it is observed that the analytically predicted density profiles are virtually identical to their numerical counterparts .    ) and ( [ tg ] ) , and its comparison with the analytical prediction ( tfa ) , given by eqs . ( 1/g ) , ( [ exact ] ) and ( [ dw ] ) , for large @xmath18 ( and/or small @xmath8 ) , _ viz_. , @xmath105 , @xmath106.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to characterize the entire family of the dw solutions , their width defined as per eq . 
 ( [ w ] ) has been numerically evaluated , as shown in fig . 
 fig : wvsm(a ) , vs. the mass ratio , @xmath8 , in the interval of @xmath107 . 
 it is seen that the dependence of the width on @xmath8 is rather weak , in agreement with examples displayed in fig . 
 [ fig : dw ] . 
 further , the dependence of the dw s width on the bec self - repulsion constant , @xmath18 , is shown in fig . [ 
 fig : wvsm](b ) . 
 the range of values of @xmath18 displayed in the figure is bounded by existence limits of the dw solutions , as given by eq . 
 ( [ g < ] ) . 
 the increase of the width with @xmath18 is a natural property of the system , as stronger self - repulsion stretches the transient layer [ in the analytical form , this is clearly shown by eq . 
 ( [ broad ] ) and solution ( [ dw ] ) . ] 
 \(a ) ( b ) 
 bubble - drop ( bd ) solutions are even ones , with @xmath108 , singled out by b.c . 
 @xmath109(a bec drop embedded into the tg background ) , or @xmath110(a tg drop embedded into the bec background ) , cf . 
 ( [ bc ] ) . 
 in fact , the bds may be considered as bound pairs of the dws , with the layer bec or tg trapped between the two semi - infinite tg or bec domains , respectively . 
 the existence and stability of these solutions has been numerically checked by fixing the chemical potential of the background to unity , and varying the norm of the drop , or more precisely :    * setting @xmath43 for the tg background , see eq . 
 ( [ db2 ] ) , and selecting several fixed values of @xmath111 for the bec drop , see eq . 
 ( [ n ] ) ; * setting @xmath112 for the bec background , see eq . 
 ( [ db1 ] ) , and selecting several fixed values of @xmath113 for the tg drop , see eq . 
 ( [ n ] ) . 
 it is relevant to stress that , unlike the dws , the chemical potentials of the bubble and drop components are not related by any condition similar to eq . 
 ( [ mumu ] ) . in this 
 setting , the remaining free parameters are relative mass @xmath8 and bec self - repulsion coefficient @xmath18 . 
 analytical results for the bd structures are available in the limit case of @xmath82 ( heavy tg atoms ) , which corresponds to eqs . 
 ( phi2phi1 ) and ( [ phi1nophi2 ] ) . indeed , in this approximation the bd solutions , defined by b.c . 
 ( [ db2 ] ) or ( [ db1 ] ) correspond , respectively , to bright solitons or bubbles produced by eq . 
 ( [ phi1nophi2 ] ) (  bubbles "" are solutions of nlses in the form of a local drop of the density supported by the flat background , without zero crossing , and without a phase shift at @xmath114 , unlike dark solitons barash ) . 
 further , the analysis of the corresponding hamiltonian ( phi1h ) demonstrates that eq . 
 ( [ phi1nophi2 ] ) can not generate bright solitons , but it readily gives rise to bubbles , i.e. , the bd patterns in the form of the tg drop embedded into the bec background . 
 the fact that the bds exist in the form of the tg drop embedded into the bec bubble , but do not exist in the reverse form , is confirmed by numerical results presented below 
 .    analytical results for the bd structures are also available in the limit case of @xmath115 or @xmath85 , when the derivative term may be neglected in eq . 
 ( [ phi1 ] ) , leading to eq . 
 ( [ 1/g ] ) , as shown above . the substitution of this approximation into eq . 
 ( [ phi2 ] ) leads to the single equation with the cubic - quintic nonlinearity . for @xmath52 
 not linked to @xmath53 by relation ( [ mumu ] ) , which was specific for the dw , but is not relevant in the present case , the cubic - quintic equation takes a form slightly more general than eq . 
 ( [ single ] ) derived above : @xmath116a straightforward consideration demonstrates that eq . 
 ( [ cq ] ) gives rise to bubbles , i.e. , effectively , the bds of type ( [ db2 ] ) , in the case of@xmath117and to bright solitons , i.e. , the bds of type ( [ db1 ] ) , in the range of@xmath118 in fact , the present limit of @xmath115 or @xmath85 implies that interval ( [ bubble ] ) does not exist , while condition ( bright ) may hold . 
 thus , this consideration again predicts that the bd exist solely in the form of a tg  drop ( bright soliton ) embedded into the bec bubble , which is exactly confirmed by numerical results following below .    in terms of the above - mentioned optics model 
 , this conclusion means that a bright soliton driven by the quintic self - defocusing may be embedded into the background filled by the optical wave subject to the cubic self - defocusing , but not vice versa .      for the state defined as per eq . 
 ( [ db2 ] ) ( a bec / cubic drop embedded into the tg / quintic background ) , it was not possible to find solutions in the entire parametric region investigated , which amounts to intervals @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and @xmath121 . in imaginary - time simulations , 
 this configuration , if taken as an input , transforms into a flat one . 
 the nonexistence of this bd species is readily explained by the analytical results presented above . 
 on the other hand , also in agreement with the above analysis , in the same parameter region ( with @xmath111 replaced by @xmath113 ) stable solutions have been readily found for the bd state defined by eq . 
 ( [ db1 ] ) ( a tg / quintic drop embedded into the bec / cubic background ) , see a typical example in fig . 
 the bd may be characterized by the _ missing mass _ of the bubble void , i.e. , @xmath122 ^{-1}\int_{-\infty } ^{+\infty } \left [ \left ( n_{1}\right ) _ 
 { \mathrm{asympt}% } -\phi _ { 1}^{2}(x)\right ] dx .   \label{mvoid}\]]computations demonstrate that , for the family of the bd states , @xmath123 very weakly depends on relative mass @xmath8 . 
 figure fig : missing_mass displays the missing mass of the bec component as a function of @xmath18 . the dependence observed in fig . [ fig : missing_mass ] may be approximated by relation @xmath124 , which is easy to understand : according to eq . 
 ( [ phi1 ] ) , the tg component with density @xmath125 replaces the missing bec field with effective density @xmath126 . 
 this argument also explains an approximately linear increase of @xmath127 with the growth of the norm of the tg / quintic drop , @xmath113 , as clearly seen in fig . 
 [ fig : missing_mass ] .    , immersed into the bec ( cubic ) background , as produced by the numerical solution of eqs .

 the bec chemical potential is @xmath133 , and the tg / bec mass ratio is @xmath130.,scaledwidth=35.0% ] 
 bright - dark - soliton ( dbs ) solutions represent complexes with one even localized ( bright ) component , and the other delocalized spatially odd zero - crossing one ( the dark soliton ) , the difference from the bd structure being that in the latter case both components were patterned as even ones , without zero crossing in the bubble structure . the corresponding b.c . for the dbs complex 
 are given by@xmath134(a bright bec component embedded into the tg background ) , or @xmath135(a bright tg component embedded into the bec background ) , cf . 
 ( [ db2 ] ) and ( [ db1 ] ) . 
 note that , similar to the case of the bd , the dbs existence condition does not impose any relation on the chemical potentials of its components , unlike eq . 
 ( [ mumu ] ) for the dw . 
 the limit case of @xmath136 ( heavy tg atoms ) , which is represented by eqs . 
 ( [ phi2phi1 ] ) and ( [ phi1nophi2 ] ) , makes it possible to produce analytical results for the dbs defined by b.c . 
 ( dbs1 ) , which corresponds to a dark soliton of eq . 
 ( [ phi1nophi2 ] ) . 
 the analysis of the hamiltonian ( [ phi1h ] ) demonstrates that eq . 
 ( phi1nophi2 ) indeed gives rise to dark solitons , i.e. , the dbs patterns in the form of the bright tg soliton embedded into the dark bec soliton . 
 the consideration of the dbs is also possible in the opposite limit of @xmath137 or @xmath85 , which amounts to the consideration of eq . 
 ( [ cq ] ) . 
 dark solitons of that equation correspond to the dbs defined by b.c . 
 ( [ dbs2 ] ) , and it is easy to see that eq . 
 ( cq ) gives rise to the dark solitons in the range of @xmath138 . 
 obviously , this condition holds in the present limit of @xmath115 or @xmath85 . 
 thus , the analysis of the limit cases readily predicts the existence of both species of the dbss , which correspond to b.c . 
 ( [ dbs2 ] ) and ( [ dbs1 ] ) . 
 this prediction is confirmed by the following numerical results . 
 both types of the dbs have been produced by the numerical computations , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : bds_profile ] . 
 \(a ) ( b )    the dbs complexes have their existence boundaries . 
 they cease to exist when the self - repulsion bec coefficient , @xmath18 , becomes too large . 
 this is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : bds_stability ] , that displays the boundaries in the plane of @xmath139 . 
 it is seen that a lower chemical potential of the dark component favors the existence of the dbs , as the boundaries move towards higher values of @xmath18 with the decrease of the chemical potential . 
 relative mass @xmath8 plays a different role : the existence area for the dbs complex with the bright bec  ( cubic ) component shrinks with the increase of @xmath8 , while for the case of the bright tg ( quintic ) component the increase of @xmath8 favors the dbs existence . 
 \(a ) ( b )     and @xmath140 , respectively.,scaledwidth=35.0% ] 
 we have introduced a binary system in the form of an immiscible pair of bec and tg quantum gases , in the effectively 1d setting . using the system of the gpe for the bec , nonlinearly coupled to the quintic nlse for the tg component , we have analyzed the possibility of the existence of three types of interfaces in this binary system : dws ( domain walls ) , bds ( bubble - drops ) , and bdss ( bright - dark solitons ) . 
 the same model applies to a bimodal light propagation in a specially designed colloidal medium in optics . 
 the immiscibility condition for the binary system of the present type was obtained in the general form . 
 analytical results were produced by means of the tfas ( thomas - fermi approximations ) , in the combination with the systematic numerical analysis . 
 the dws have been found an explicit analytical form , by means of the tfa , and in the generic form numerically . 
 the analysis and numerical results demonstrate that the bds exist solely in the form of the tg drop immersed into the bec background , while the bds complexes may be built equally well of the tg bright and bec dark components or vice versa . 
 thus , the predicted results suggest new experiments with tightly confined two - species mixtures of ultracold bosonic gases . the analysis can be extended for a chain of bds and/or dbss in a long system , including a circular one , which corresponds to the binary gas loaded into a tight toroidal trap @xcite .

13,"primordial black holes ( pbhs ) can form in the early universe via the collapse of large density perturbations  @xcite . 
 there are tight constraints on the abundance of pbhs formed from their present day gravitational effects and the consequences of their evaporation . 
 these limits can be used to constrain the power spectrum of the primordial density , or curvature , perturbations . 
 the pbh constraints on the curvature power spectrum are fairly weak , being many orders of magnitude larger than the measurements on cosmological scales . 
 they do , however , apply over a very wide range of scales and therefore provide a useful constraint on models of inflation . 
 peiris and easther  @xcite have shown that there are single field inflation models , which are compatible with all cosmological observations , for which the perturbation amplitude on small scales is large enough to produce a significant density of pbhs .    for scales which exit the horizon close to the end of inflation 
 the standard ( stewart - lyth  @xcite ) formulae for the amplitude of perturbations do not hold . leach and liddle  @xcite carried out a numerical calculation of the evolution of perturbations for a quadratic inflationary potential . 
 they found that the perturbations on scales which exit the horizon close to the end of inflation were roughly an order of magnitude larger than predicted by the stewart - lyth formula ( see also ref . 
 @xcite ) . therefore to fully exploit the power of pbh constraints on inflation models , a numerical calculation of the amplitude of perturbations on small scales is required . 
 it has recently been shown  @xcite that pbhs can also form on scales which never leave the horizon . 
 we do not consider this possibility here .    in this paper 
 we use a modified flow analysis to identify inflation models where the perturbations at the end of inflation may be large enough for primordial black holes to be overproduced . for these models 
 we carry out a numerical evolution of the primordial perturbations and use the pbh constraints on the power spectrum to eliminate models which overproduce pbhs . 
 we describe the modified flow analysis in sec . 
 [ flow ] and the evolution of perturbations and the calculation of the power spectrum in sec . 
 we apply the primordial black hole abundance constraints and present our results in sec . 
 [ results ] and conclude with discussion in sec .  [ discuss ] . 
 we consider the hubble slow roll - parameters  @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the planck mass and @xmath2 denotes differentiation with respect to the scalar field , @xmath3 . 
 the flow equations  @xcite encode the variation of the slow - roll parameters in terms of the number of e - foldings from the end of inflation , @xmath4}$ ] and provide a method for stochastically generating inflation models : @xmath5(^l\lambda_h ) + ^{l+1}\lambda_h \ , ,    \\ & & \hspace{50 mm } l\ge 1                \nonumber \label{flowequations}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 . 
 following kinney  @xcite we randomly chose ` initial ' values for the slow - roll parameters and @xmath8 , the number of e - foldings between cosmological scales exiting the horizon and the end of inflation , in the ranges : @xmath9 \ , , \\ 
 \nonumber \epsilon_h&=&[0,0.8 ]   \ , , \\    \nonumber \sigma_h&=&[-0.5,0.5 ] \ , , \\ 
 \nonumber ^2\lambda_h \equiv \xi_h&=&[-0.05,0.05 ]   \,,\\      \nonumber ^3\lambda_h&=&[-0.005,0.005 ]   \ , , \\ 
 \nonumber & ... & \\ ^{m+1}\lambda_h&=&0 \ , , \label{hierarchy}\end{aligned}\ ] ] truncating the hierarchy at @xmath10 . 
 we then evolve the flow equations forward in time ( @xmath11 ) from @xmath12 until either @xmath13 or inflation ends with @xmath14 . in the former case 
 we calculate the cosmological observables , the spectral index , @xmath15 , its running , @xmath16 , and the scalar to tensor ratio , @xmath17 , using the initial values of the slow - roll parameters  @xcite : @xmath18   \ , , \\ 
 r & = & \epsilon_h [ 1-c_1(\sigma_h+2\epsilon_h ) ] \ , ,   \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the latter case 
 we evolve the flow equations backward @xmath8 e - folds and calculate the cosmological observables at this point 
 . in some cases inflation also ends when evolving backwards before @xmath8 e - folds are achieved . 
 these models are incapable of supporting the required amount of inflation and are discarded . 
 our algorithm differs from that originally proposed by kinney  @xcite in how we handle models chosen from the initial hierarchy that are destined to inflate forever , @xmath21 , but do not reach this limit within @xmath8 e - foldings . in the original flow algorithm in this case 
 the cosmological observables are calculated at the late - time fixed point i.e. the model is forced to evolve to its asymptotic limit . in this limit 
 the running of the spectral index is negligible . 
 therefore for models which are compatible with the wmap 7 year measurement of the spectral index , @xmath22  @xcite , the amplitude of the curvature perturbations can not be large on any scale and pbhs are never formed in significant numbers  @xcite . 
 following peiris and easther  @xcite , we do not force these models to evolve to their asymptotic limit but instead terminate them once @xmath8 e - folds of inflation have occurred . at this point 
 it is assumed that another mechanism , for example a second - field such as in hybrid inflation  @xcite , terminates inflation . with this treatment 
 some of these models are consistent with the wmap measurements of the spectral index and its running , but have perturbations on small scales which may be large enough to over - produce pbhs  @xcite . 
 the evolution of inflationary curvature perturbations , @xmath23 , is carried out using the mukhanov variable  @xcite , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 the fourier modes , @xmath26 , evolve according to a klein - gordon equation with a time - varying effective mass : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is conformal time , @xmath29 , and @xmath30   \ , . 
 \label{exactdespite}\end{aligned}\ ] ] at early times , @xmath31 , when a mode @xmath32 is well within the horizon , @xmath33 , the initial condition for @xmath34 , is taken to be the bunch - davies vacuum state , @xmath35 in the superhorizon limit , @xmath36 , eq .  ( [ mukhanoveomtau ] ) has a growing mode solution @xmath37 , so that the curvature perturbation @xmath38 ` freezes out ' and becomes constant . 
 the power - spectrum of the curvature perturbations can thus be calculated as @xmath39 eq . 
 ( [ mukhanoveomtau ] ) can be solved exactly for the special case of power - law inflation . 
 the commonly used stewart - lyth formula is found via a slow - roll expansion around this exact solution  @xcite : @xmath40 ^ 2}{\pi\epsilon_h } \left(\frac{h}{m_{\rm{pl}}}\right)^2_{k = ah } \ , ,        \label{stewartlyth}\ ] ] where @xmath41 . 
 this expression gives the power spectrum in the asymptotic superhorizon limit , @xmath42 , in terms of the hubble parameter and slow - roll parameters evaluated at horizon crossing  @xcite . 
 it is valid provided that the slow - roll approximation holds ( specifically that the slow - roll parameters are slowly varying around horizon crossing ) and the asymptotic limit is reached before inflation ends  @xcite . for modes which exit the horizon close to the end of inflation the asymptotic limit will not be reached , and the slow - roll approximation may also be violated . 
 leach & liddle  @xcite investigated this for a simple quadratic chaotic inflation model . 
 they found that for scales that exit the horizon very close to the end of inflation the power spectrum is roughly an order of magnitude larger than that found using the stewart - lyth expression . 
 in other words , analytic calculations can significantly underestimate the amplitude of perturbations and hence the abundance of pbhs formed . 
 therefore , a numerical calculation of the perturbation evolution is required to accurately compute the primordial power spectrum on the very smallest scales . 
 we use a modified version of the inflation v2 module ( written by lesgourgues & valkenburg )  @xcite to carry out an accurate numerical calculation of the evolution of perturbations . fig . 
 [ numericalenhancement ] shows the power spectrum of curvature perturbations of an example inflation model generated using the modified horizon flow formalism . 
 the power spectrum on large scales is compatible with the wmap 7 year data , while the perturbations on small scales are sufficiently large that pbhs may be over - produced . 
 the stewart - lyth calculation is in good agreement with the numerical calculation until the final few e - folds of inflation . on these small scales , the assumptions that are employed in the stewart - lyth calculation break down , and the numerical calculation finds a significant enhancement of the amplitude of the perturbations 
 , @xmath43 and @xmath17 , for models generated using the modified flow algorithm described in the text .

 [ flow ] to generate a large ensemble ( 250,000 ) of inflation models . in fig . 
 [ stochasticresults ] ( top row ) we plot the cosmological observables for all models which are able to sustain the required number of e - foldings of inflation , @xmath8 . in around @xmath44 of the models inflation ends naturally via @xmath45 and these largely populate the concentrated diagonal feature seen in the left hand plots as well as the @xmath46 line ( c.f . 
 @xcite ) . in the remaining @xmath47 of models , @xmath48 
 and it is assumed , c.f . 
 @xcite , that a secondary mechanism , such as hybrid inflation , acts to end inflation in these cases . 
 large positive running is in principle allowed ( see top right plot ) , however these models may have large amplitude perturbations on small scales and hence overproduce pbhs . 
 to apply the pbh constraints we use the stewart - lyth expression for the power spectrum , eq . 
 ( [ stewartlyth ] ) , to identify inflation models where the amplitude of the perturbations on small scales which exit the horizon close to the end of inflation is large , and may lead to the over - production of pbhs . for these models , we then carry out an accurate numerical evolution of the primordial perturbations , as described in sec . 
 [ pert ] . 
 the pbh abundance constraints have recently been compiled and updated in refs . 
 the resulting constraints on the amplitude of the power spectrum are typically in the range @xmath49 with some scale dependence  @xcite . 
 to be conservative we use the constraint @xmath50 . 
 the bottom row of fig . 
 [ stochasticresults ] shows the cosmological observables for the models which remain once those which over - produce pbhs are excluded . 
 the @xmath44 of the original models for which inflation ends naturally generally have @xmath51 on all scales and so are unaffected by the pbh constraints . of the remaining models , in which inflation continues indefinitely in the absence of a secondary mechanism , @xmath52 are excluded by pbh overproduction 
 . of the models initially generated , only approximately @xmath53 end via a secondary mechanism and do not overproduce pbhs . with an accurate numerical calculation of the perturbations 
 the number of these models decreases by approximately @xmath54 . 
 large positive running is now excluded as expected ( see bottom - right plot ) . 
 cosmological constraints on @xmath43 eliminate a significant fraction of the models generated using flow algorithms  @xcite . 
 a full mcmc analysis of cosmological data is beyond the scope of this work , however a simple application of the observational constraints shows that a significant fraction of cosmologically viable models are excluded by pbh constraints . of the models 
 generated using our modified flow analysis which have cosmological observables within the 3@xmath55 ranges found by wmap7  @xcite @xmath56 are excluded by pbh over - production . 
 this illustrates that in the era of precision cosmological measurements pbh still provide a powerful constraint on inflation models . 
 we have applied constraints on the primordial power spectrum from the overproduction of primordial black holes to inflation models generated by a modified flow algorithm . 
 the amplitude of inflationary perturbations is usually calculated using the stewart - lyth  @xcite expression , however for scales which exit the horizon close to the end of inflation the assumptions underlying this expression are violated . 
 a numerical calculation is therefore required , and the amplitude of the perturbations on small scales can be significantly enhanced  @xcite . 
 the models generated by the modified flow algorithm which end naturally ( roughly @xmath44 of the total ) generally have a red spectrum of perturbations on all scales and so are unaffected by pbh constraints . 
 the remaining @xmath47 of models equations have a late time attractor with @xmath57 and it is assumed that an auxiliary mechanism terminates inflation . 
 the majority of these models are however excluded due to pbh over - production . 
 the number of viable models decreases if the power spectrum is calculated numerically . of the models 
 generated using our modified flow analysis which have cosmological observables within the 3@xmath55 ranges found by wmap7  @xcite @xmath56 are excluded by pbh over - production . 
 we conclude that pbh constraints provide a significant constraint on models of inflation . furthermore to exploit their full power an accurate numerical calculation of the amplitude of primordial perturbations on small scales , which exit the horizon close to the end of inflation , is required .

 we demonstrate that pbhs constrain these types of inflation models and show that a numerical evaluation of the power spectrum decreases the number of otherwise viable models of inflation .",all models which sustain the required number of e foldings of inflation are shown in the top two plots and those remaining once pbh constraints are applied are shown in the bottom plots title fig width 154 and for models generated using the modified flow algorithm described in the text. the flow equations encode the variation of the slow roll parameters in terms of the number of e foldings from the end of inflation and provide a method for stochastically generating inflation models l 1 lambda_h hspace 50 mm l ge 1 nonumber label flowequations end aligned where and. on these small scales the assumptions that are employed in the stewart lyth calculation break down and the numerical calculation finds a significant enhancement of the amplitude of the perturbations and for models generated using the modified flow algorithm described in the text. following kinney we randomly chose initial values for the slow roll parameters and the number of e foldings between cosmological scales exiting the horizon and the end of inflation in the ranges nonumber epsilon_h 0 0 8 nonumber sigma_h 0 5 0 5 nonumber 2 lambda_h equiv xi_h 0 05 0 05 nonumber 3 lambda_h 0 005 0 005 nonumber .  stewartlyth to identify inflation models where the amplitude of the perturbations on small scales which exit the horizon close to the end of inflation is large and may lead to the over production of pbhs. therefore for models which are compatible with the wmap 7 year measurement of the spectral index the amplitude of the curvature perturbations can not be large on any scale and pbhs are never formed in significant numbers. the amplitude of inflationary perturbations is usually calculated using the stewart lyth expression however for scales which exit the horizon close to the end of inflation the assumptions underlying this expression are violated. in the former case we calculate the cosmological observables the spectral index its running and the scalar to tensor ratio using the initial values of the slow roll parameters r epsilon_h 1 c_1 sigma_h 2 epsilon_h end aligned where and. peiris and easther have shown that there are single field inflation models which are compatible with all cosmological observations for which the perturbation amplitude on small scales is large enough to produce a significant density of pbhs. they found that the perturbations on scales which exit the horizon close to the end of inflation were roughly an order of magnitude larger than predicted by the stewart lyth formula see also ref,0.3920265780730897,0.16666666666666666,0.19933554817275748
14,"the flight management infrastructure ( fmi ) product is intended to keep the aircraft from interfering with preplanned observations on the sky . 
 it predicts the ground tracks necessary to execute its mission , and corrects the plan for actual conditions while airborne . to support this , 
 it contains both a planning component that can run on the ground and in the air , and an execution component that runs in the air . 
 the planning component manages a set of ordered observations and optional aircraft repositioning requests . 
 the execution component compares the plan to actual conditions in flight and requests headings ( indirectly ) from the autopilot . 
 sofia mission planning differs from satellite or ground based observatory planning in a few key areas . 
 most importantly , the observatory position is a function of observation target history , which prevents observations from being considered as time - slots alone . 
 assignment of flight dates is also nontrivial  targets can not be localized on the sky or the observatory will always fly in about the same direction ( requiring nearly equivalent dead time to return ) ; this suggests entire flight series should be considered at once , for greater target variety . 
 flight planning and execution differs from conventional as well . 
 all conventional aircraft fly from point to point along specified paths on the ground , and `` drift '' the aircraft to compensate for winds . 
 typical drift angles ( course - heading ) exceed 3@xmath0 , and the worst possible case approaches 30@xmath0 , so sofia can not necessarily observe in this manner . 
 expected winds can be planned for using a weather forecast . 
 correcting course for _ unexpected _ winds can be accomplished by adjusting observation durations , by relocating the aircraft between observations , or by `` observation triage '' as a last resort . 
 this requires an astronomically - aware airborne monitoring function to compare current conditions to plan . 
 aircraft capabilities are a strong function of fuel weight , which argues against simple parametrizing by time , in favor of fuel . 
 in addition to the geometrical and practical constraints described above , the sofia flight planning problem also has a number of external constraints , all of which prevent a truly automated , or even rigorously sequential , flight planning process . for instance , special use airspace ( sua ) incursions may require external approval , and it can not be known ahead of time whether such approval will be forthcoming in all cases . 
 national airspace boundaries require international agreements . over - ocean operations 
 are prohibited for safety reasons for the first flights ; for later flights , fairly complex fuel reserve constraints are required . 
 gross takeoff weight has a hard limit of 700,000 pounds , which limits the duration of sofia missions . 
 some science - driven constraints require interaction with scientists or detailed knowledge of the observations ; especially , trading off water vapor overburden estimates with altitude and duration , and for trading off observations against each other . 
 prior to any particular mission , several iterations of flight planning are performed . 
 this is expected to include fully integrated automated flight planning ( frank , gross , & krkl 2004 ) , routinely . 
 manual choice of observation ( including order ) will occur subsequently . upon execution , replanning might occur if conditions are sufficiently different from assumptions . 
 figure  [ fig : sampleflight ] shows a color - processed screenshot of a simulated flight intended for april , 2008 , from palmdale , ca . 
 actual conditions for the simulation shown differ from planned only by small timing errors of the order of several seconds between segments and at takeoff . 
 as mentioned earlier , it is advantageous to consider entire flight series at once , in order to trade observations between flights . 
 the data structure supporting this is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : flightseries ] . 
 fmi requires substantial input data in order to accurately predict a flight track and its constraints . 
 weather forecast time - series are taken from the national center for environmental prediction global forecasting system , quadrilinearly interpolated . 
 an alternative is required for dates more than several days in the future , since accurate forecasts are not available then ; we use a set of stacked monthly means for 19972001 ( the last years available ) from the european center for medium ranger weather forcasting 40 year reanalysis ( uppala et . 
 al . 2005 ) also quadrilinearly interpolated . 
 aircraft performance is interpolated from tables generated by boeing inflt runs , for cruising , thrust - limited climbs , and descents .    planned flight track intersections with special use airspace ( sua ) boundaries ( including non - us zones , from the us national imagery and mapping agency ) are evaluated using a quadtree - based search on the 8000 + sua boundaries for each flight segment . 
 observation segments are treated as initial value problems in cartesian coordinates , others may be boundary or initial problems , as appropriate . 
 desired headings are calculated during execution from planned ( not actual ) sky coordinates and actual position ; direct steering by the telescope can not be allowed for safety reasons .    in order to test fmi components and integrate other systems , as well as for training purposes 
 , we use a simulation environment . 
 this includes a medium - fidelity aircraft simulator , an automated pilot simulator , a method to set the time arbitrarily , and a telescope simulator ( brggenwirth , gross , nelbach , & shuping 2008 ) .    while airborne , the fmi software components interact with the airborne data acquisition software to acquire the aircraft s position and attitude . while on the ground , the planner portion of fmi interacts with observers planning software and must support multiple simultaneous planning sessions . 
 the airborne configuration is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : dataflow ] ; the ground configuration is similar , except there is no flight executor nor mccs data ( except in testing configurations ) , and there is a connection to the observation planning database . 
 sofia presents a unique flight planning problem due to the nature of astronomical observation . 
 fmi provides a connection between scientific needs of an observatory with the practical constraints of operating an aircraft , without introducing excessive safety considerations or pilot workload , or planner effort .

15,"qcd at finite quark / baryon - number density at zero and at finite temperature describes nuclear matter 
 . nuclear matter at high temperatures ( and possibly densities ) was certainly present in the early universe . 
 neutron stars consist of dense cold nuclear matter . 
 rhic and the cern heavy - ion program promise to produce hot nuclear matter in the laboratory . calculating the properties of high density nuclear matter could predict if and where strange matter could be produced . 
 any method which can be used to determine the properties of nuclear matter could be adapted to nuclear physics calculations . 
 finite quark - number density is best achieved by introducing a chemical potential @xmath0 for quark - number , and using the grand - canonical partition function . 
 unfortunately , this renders the euclidean - time fermion determinant complex , with a real part which can change sign . 
 standard lattice simulations , which rely on importance sampling , fail in this case . attempting to circumvent these problems by using canonical ( fixed quark number ) ensembles fail except at high temperatures @xcite because of sign problems .    until a simulation method is found 
 which avoids these difficulties , it is useful to study models which exhibit _ some _ of the properties of qcd at high @xmath0 . 
 now it is expected that , at zero temperature , nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition at @xmath0 of order one third the mass of the nucleon . 
 it has been proposed that at still higher @xmath0 the ground state is characterised by a diquark condensate @xcite . 
 such a condensate would not only cause spontaneous breaking of baryon number , but would also spontaneously break colour . since colour is a gauge symmetry , such breaking 
 is realized in the higgs mode . 
 thus nuclear matter would become a colour superconductor at high @xmath0 . 
 for this reason we have simulated 2-colour qcd , i.e. su(2 ) yang - mills theory with fermion matter fields ( ` quarks ' ) in the fundamental representation of @xmath4 , and finite @xmath0 . as well as having colour confinement 
 this theory does exhibit diquark condensation as we shall demonstrate in this paper , but for @xmath5 , since the diquark ` baryons ' in the same multiplet as the pions , also have mass @xmath6 . 
 for @xmath7 the phenomenon is describable as a rotation of the condensate from the chiral to the diquark direction as predicted by effective lagrangian analyses @xcite . 
 unlike in true ( 3-colour ) qcd , the diquark condensates are colourless , and the broken symmetry is realized in the goldstone mode , and there is no colour superconductivity , but rather superfluidity , as in liquid @xmath8he . despite this , we shall later argue that this theory is more similar to 2-flavour qcd than one might think ( see section 4 ) . 
 since 2-colour qcd has a non - negative determinant and pfaffian , even at non - zero @xmath0 , standard simulation methods can be used . 
 we use the hybrid molelcular - dynamics method and simulate the theory with 4 flavours of staggered quarks @xcite . 
 pfaffian simulations of a 4-fermion model including a diquark source term have been reported in @xcite . 
 we have run simulations at a moderately large quark mass and an intermediate gauge coupling on @xmath1 and @xmath9 lattices , i.e. at zero temperature . 
 we measured order parameters including the chiral and diquark condensates , the quark - number and energy densities , and the wilson line ( polyakov loop ) . 
 the larger lattice allowed us to observe finite size effects and , more importantly to measure the scalar and pseudoscalar meson and diquark masses , which include all the potential goldstone bosons in the theory . 
 preliminary results from these simulations were reported at lattice2000 , bangalore @xcite . 
 the extension of these calculations to finite temperature was reported in a recent letter @xcite . 
 this work builds on early work with 8 quark flavours which presented far less conclusive results @xcite . 
 previous studies of diquark condensation in this model with various numbers of flavours have either used the approximation where @xmath10 in the updating algorithm @xcite ( as does @xcite ) , or been in the strong gauge - coupling regime @xcite . 
 section 2 introduces the staggered - fermion lattice port of 2-colour qcd . 
 the results of our simulation are presented in section 3 . 
 section 4 gives our conclusions and indicates future avenues of research . 
 because in 2-colour qcd fundamental quarks and antiquarks lie in the same representation of @xmath4 the flavour symmetry group for @xmath11 flavours is enlarged from @xmath12 to @xmath13 . 
 the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking is @xmath14 rather than the usual @xmath15 @xcite . 
 3-colour qcd with 1 staggered quark ( 4 continuum flavours ) has a @xmath16 flavour symmetry . for 2 colours this 
 is enhanced to @xmath17 @xcite . 
 chiral or quark - number symmetry breaking ( the chiral and diquark condensates lie in the same u(2 ) multiplet ) occurs according to the pattern @xmath18 . 
 the quark action for 2-colour qcd with one staggered quark is @xmath19\chi   + \frac{1}{2}\lambda[\chi^t\tau_2\chi + \bar{\chi}\tau_2\bar{\chi}^t]\right\ } \label{eqn : lagrangian}\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the normal staggered covariant finite difference operator with @xmath0 introduced by multiplying the links in the @xmath21 direction by @xmath22 and those in the @xmath23 direction by @xmath24 . 
 the superscript @xmath25 stands for transposition . 
 note that we have introduced a gauge - invariant majorana mass @xmath26 which explicitly breaks quark - number symmetry . 
 such an explicit symmetry breaking term is needed to observe spontaneous symmetry breaking on a finite lattice 
 . we shall be interested in the limit @xmath27 . 
 integrating out these fermion fields yields @xmath28 = \sqrt{{\rm det}({\cal a}^\dagger { \cal a } + \lambda^2 ) } \label{eqn : pfaffian}\ ] ] where @xmath29 we note that @xmath30 is positive definite for finite @xmath26 . hence the pfaffian never vanishes and thus , by continuity arguments never changes sign and can be chosen to be positive . 
 note that @xmath31 has been shown to be positive in @xcite . denoting the @xmath32 matrix in equation  [ eqn : pfaffian ] by @xmath33 
 we have seen that its determinant is the determinant of a positive definite matrix and thus can be used directly in our simulations . 
 to do this we define @xmath34 by @xmath35            { \cal m }     \left[\begin{array}{cc } \tau_2      &       0             \\                                                          0        &       1                                                                \end{array}\right]\ ] ] so that @xmath36\ ] ] and @xmath37.\ ] ] we note that @xmath38 = \det[{\cal a}^\dagger { \cal a } + \lambda^2]$ ] . 
 because we are now dealing with the matrix @xmath39 we can use the hybrid molecular dynamics method with ` noisy ' fermions @xcite to simulate this theory . here , although we generate gaussian noise with both upper and lower components , we keep only the upper components of the pseudo - fermion field to calculate @xmath40 $ ] , which means that we only need to invert @xmath30 at each update . 
 keeping only half the components of the pseudo - fermion field is entirely analogous to keeping only the fermion fields on even sites in normal qcd simulations . 
 the square root of equation  [ eqn : pfaffian ] is obtained by inserting a factor of @xmath41 in front of the fermion term in the stochastic action in the standard manner . 
 we now give a brief discussion of symmetry breaking in this model . 
 this is covered in more detail in @xcite . at @xmath42 , 
 the @xmath17 symmetry will break spontaneously . 
 two directions in which it will choose to break are of particular interest . 
 the first is where it breaks to give a non - zero chiral condensate @xmath43 . 
 there will be 3 goldstone bosons corresponding to the 3 broken generators of @xmath17 . 
 these states and their corresponding @xmath17 generators are @xmath44 @xmath45 remains unbroken . 
 the second is where @xmath17 breaks to give a non - zero diquark condensate @xmath46 . 
 this time the 3 goldstone bosons and corresponding generators are @xmath47 @xmath48 remains unbroken . 
 when @xmath49 only 2 goldstone bosons remain , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . 
 when in addition @xmath52 , only the latter state remains a goldstone boson . 
 a more detailed study of the patterns of symmetry breaking can be performed in terms of an effective lagrangian for the goldstone modes as in @xcite . 
 the only difference is that the effective field , denoted @xmath53 in that work , here belongs to a symmetric @xmath32 tensor representation of @xmath17 rather than to the antisymmetric @xmath54 representation of @xmath13 of the continuum case . 
 one can see the remnant @xmath55 symmetry when @xmath27 by allowing @xmath26 to become complex . 
 the majorana mass term in equation  [ eqn : lagrangian ] then becomes @xmath56 $ ] . 
 @xmath57 is replaced by @xmath58 in the pfaffian . 
 although the 2-flavour theory would be of more interest in the continuum , we have chosen to simulate the 4-flavour theory because this represents a single staggered quark species and thus has well defined symmetries and a well defined spectrum at all lattice spacings . unlike the 8-flavour case simulated in @xcite it probably does have a sensible continuum limit . 
 we have simulated 2-colour qcd with 1 staggered quark species ( 4 continuum flavours ) on @xmath1 and @xmath9 lattices . 
 the simulations reported here are all at @xmath59 which is roughly the @xmath60 for the finite temperature transition on an @xmath61 lattice @xcite . 
 this first set of simulations has been performed with quark mass @xmath62 in lattice units . 
 these simulations are currently being repeated at @xmath63 , where the smaller pion mass will give a richer spectrum of goldstone and pseudo - goldstone bosons and where a larger portion of the relevant phase diagram should be described by effective lagrangians . 
 ( we have also performed some zero temperature simulations at @xmath64 and @xmath65 . 
 this has been reported in our finite temperature / finite @xmath0 letter @xcite . ) 
 since we wished to take the limit @xmath27 , we needed @xmath66 . 
 the values we chose were @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath62 . 
 ( at low @xmath0 s we also ran at @xmath10 . ) 
 the smaller lattice was used to map out the interesting range of @xmath0 values , measuring order parameters including the diquark condensate @xmath69 , the chiral condensate @xmath70 , and the number density @xmath71 . 
 in addition to measuring these quantities on the larger lattice , we also calculated the spectrum of potential goldstone bosons . 
 the length of each ` run ' was 2000 molecular dynamics time units . 
 @xmath72 had to be chosen as low as @xmath73 for @xmath67 and @xmath74 . in figure 
 [ fig : pt2p ] we have plotted the diquark condensate as a function of @xmath0 at each @xmath26 for both lattice sizes . 
 since we are interested in the limit where the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath27 , we have performed a linear extrapolation of the diquark condensate to @xmath10 . 
 note that the effective lagrangian calculations @xcite suggest that linear extrapolations are the correct approach for @xmath26 sufficiently small , except at @xmath75 . 
 the results of these extrapolations are plotted in figure  [ fig : pt2p_0 ] . 
 what we first notice is that for @xmath76 , the extrapolated diquark condensate is small enough that we can believe that it should be zero . 
 for @xmath77 it is clearly non - zero . 
 the points at @xmath78 would appear to show finite size rounding were it not for the fact that the @xmath1 and @xmath9 points are so close together . 
 we think it more likely that @xmath78 is so close to the transition that the linear extrapolation has broken down . 
 we therfore conclude that the system undergoes a phase transition at @xmath79 . 
 if this holds true , the fact that @xmath75 is less than @xmath80 would indicate that the diquark ` baryons ' do not exist as free particles but bind into ` nuclear ' matter . over the range @xmath81 , the condensate increases with a curvature consistent with a critical index @xmath82 ( the tree level effective lagrangian analysis predicts the mean field result @xmath83 ) . since the condensate starts to decrease soon after @xmath84 , the scaling region is narrow and it would require more points to even try to extract this critical index . for @xmath85 , the condensate starts to decrease , approaching zero for large @xmath0 , which would appear to be a saturation effect . 
 in fact figure  [ fig : pt2p_0 ] suggests that the condensate vanishes for @xmath86 , indicating a saturation phase transition . 
 we shall have more to say about this later . 
 note that this decrease in the condensate with @xmath0 is not predicted by the effective lagrangian analysis , which is only expected to be valid for small @xmath0 and @xmath6 . 
 this is not surprising if it is indeed a saturation effect . 
 saturation is a result of the fermi statistics of the quarks , and should not be seen in a model which only considers the system s bosonic excitations . 
 we now turn to a consideration of the chiral condensate , @xmath70 . 
 this is plotted in figure  [ fig : pbp ] for our 2 different lattice sizes .    in the @xmath27 limit , this is expected to be constant at its @xmath87 value for @xmath88 . 
 these plots are consistent with this expectation . above @xmath75 , 
 effective lagrangian studies predict that the condensate merely rotates from the chiral direction to the diquark direction , so that the magnitude of the condensate , i.e. @xmath89 , should remain constant and independent of @xmath26 . 
 since the diquark condensate increases up to @xmath90 , this means that the chiral condensate should fall , as it does . 
 it , however , continues to fall past this point , because of saturation effects , appearing to vanish for @xmath91 . to test the prediction that the principal effect for @xmath92 is merely a rotation , 
 we have tabulated @xmath89 in table  [ tab : condensate ] . 
 .magnitude of the condensate @xmath89 as functions of @xmath0 and @xmath26 on a @xmath9 lattice . 
 errors are not quoted but they are in the next or a subsequent digit after the least significant quoted digit . [ cols=""^,^,^ "" , ]     we see that , for @xmath93 , the magnitude of the condensate is approximately constant and independent of @xmath26 , so that the main effect is a rotation of the condensate from the direction of chiral symmetry breaking to that of quark - number breaking . 
 for @xmath94 , it decreases with increasing @xmath0 approaching zero for large @xmath0 .    in figure  [ 
 fig : j0 ] we plot the quark - number density @xmath71 as a function of @xmath0 for our 2 lattices . 
 @xmath95 is consistent with zero as @xmath27 , for @xmath88 . 
 ( note effective lagrangians predict that it vanishes quadratically with @xmath26 in this region . ) above @xmath75 it increases with increasing @xmath0 approaching the saturation value of 2 ( 1 staggered quark field of each colour / site , the maximum value allowed by fermi statistics ) for large @xmath0 . 
 note that figure [ fig : j0 ] suggests that @xmath96 for @xmath91 with @xmath97 consistent with that predicted from the condensates . 
 this indicates that it is this saturation which causes the condensates to vanish for @xmath91 . 
 it also tells us that this transition is an artifact of the finite lattice spacing and would recede to infinite @xmath0 in the continuum limit .    on the @xmath9 lattice we have measured the propagators for all the potential goldstone bosons , both scalar and pseudoscalar using a single noisy point source for the connected propagators and multiple ( 5 ) noisy point sources for the disconnected propagators . 
 we have measured both diagonal and off - diagonal zero momentum propagators .    in figure  [ 
 fig : goldstone ] we show the masses from fitting the propagator for the diquark state produced by applying the operator @xmath51 to the vacuum , to the form @xmath98 + \exp[-m_g(n_t - t ) ] \right\},\ ] ] valid for large temporal separations @xmath25 . as argued in section  2 , this is the expected goldstone boson for @xmath99 and @xmath10 . 
 the effective lagrangian approach indicates that , in the low @xmath0 phase , this mass should be quadratic in @xmath26 , while in the high @xmath0 phase , it should vanish as @xmath100 . 
 we have performed extrapolations based on this and plotted them in the figure . 
 for the 3 points closest to the transition @xmath101 , we have performed both extrapolations . 
 for @xmath102 and @xmath10 , we expect @xmath103 with @xmath104 . 
 we see that for @xmath105 , the points obtained from quadratic extrapolation lie on this straight line , the point at @xmath106 is close to the line and that for @xmath107 lies above this line . 
 all points for @xmath108 obtained by square root extrapolation are negative . 
 the points at @xmath109 show the most significant negative values ( although both are greater than @xmath110 ) , and should be considered as transitional . 
 the other points are so close to zero that one can easily attribute the difference as being due to a combination of the systematic errors in extracting masses from point source propagators and higher order terms in the extrapolation . 
 thus our results are consistent with a transition to a phase with a massless ( goldstone ) scalar diquark at @xmath111 , as expected . 
 finally the large value of this diquark mass at @xmath112 is further indication that the system has passed through the saturation phase transition . 
 we now turn to consideration of the other potential goldstone bosons of the theory . 
 since at this quark mass , @xmath113 is relatively large , we concentrate on those states which are expected to have masses of order @xmath6 or less over the range of interest . for this reason 
 , we consider the pion itself . for @xmath88 , its mass should remain constant at @xmath6 , and it is created by the operator @xmath114 . for @xmath99 , it is expected to mix with the pseudoscalar diquark state created from the vacuum by the operator @xmath50 . rather than trying to diagonalize the propagator over these 2 states , we have instead calculated the diagonal propagators for each of these states separately . these we fit to the form @xmath115 + \exp[-m_\pi(n_t - t ) ] \right\ }           + b ( -1)^t \left\ { \exp[-m_{b1 } t ] + \exp[-m_{b1}(n_t - t ) ] \right\}\ ] ] or the form with @xmath116 , and a similar form for the diquark state . 
 these masses are plotted in figure  [ fig : pseudo ] . 
 note that these 2 graphs are almost identical . 
 for @xmath99 , this is expected , since the 2 states mix . for @xmath88 
 this is not , a priori , expected since the diquark state should exhibit a linear decrease with @xmath0 for @xmath10 . 
 however , since @xmath117 this gives a small mixing with the pion state , which is then the lowest mass particle contributing to this pseudoscalar diquark propagator in this region . 
 it is precisely because this mixing is so small that the errors are so large . 
 the final indicator that this is the correct interpretation was that the @xmath87 , @xmath10 propagator yielded no sensible mass fit , a sure indicator that the mass was large where there can be no mixing . 
 the pion mass fits in this low @xmath0 domain are consistent with the expectation that the @xmath10 pion mass is independent of @xmath0 in this region . 
 for @xmath99 these masses fall faster than the expected @xmath118 . 
 at least part of the reason for this more rapid falloff is the saturation effect . 
 note that the reason that this mass tends to zero at large @xmath0 ( before the saturation transition ) is because the pseudoscalar diquark would be a goldstone boson if @xmath119 , and as @xmath0 increases the relative importance of @xmath120 diminishes . 
 the fact that the @xmath121 mass becomes more poorly determined for large @xmath0 is because here , the lowest mass state in this channel is predominantly the pseudoscalar diquark .    it is interesting to contrast our findings with those of a study of adjoint quarks in 2-colour qcd @xcite with @xmath26 set to zero , implying strictly no mixing ; in this case @xmath6 was found to rise as @xmath122 for @xmath123 , with the signal becoming appreciably noisier in the high density phase . 
 both behaviours are in accord with the predictions of chiral perturbation theory for a meson formed from quarks with a symmetric combination of quantum numbers under the residual global symmetry , the difference arising due to the distinct dyson indices of each model @xcite . 
 two - colour lattice qcd with one staggered quark species ( 4 continuum flavours ) has been studied at finite chemical potential @xmath0 for quark number . 
 we have shown conclusive evidence that this theory undergoes a phase transition to a phase characterized by a diquark condensate which spontaneously breaks quark - number , at @xmath124 . 
 this transition appears to be second order . 
 the simulations were performed at an intermediate value of the coupling ( close to @xmath60 for the finite temperature transition at @xmath87 on a lattice with @xmath61 ) . because of this , the relevant symmetry was the lattice flavour symmetry @xmath17 rather than the @xmath125 of the continuum 4-flavour theory . 
 we have presented convincing evidence that the scalar diquark is the goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of quark number for @xmath99 . 
 in addition we have measured the lightest mass in the pion channel as a function of @xmath0 . for @xmath7 the chiral condensate and diquark condensate 
 are well described as a single condensate of constant magnitude which rotates from the chiral direction for @xmath88 towards the diquark direction as @xmath0 is increased above @xmath75 . despite the fact that the quark mass @xmath62 was large enough that @xmath6 was not small relative to the 2-colour qcd scale , we saw good qualitative agreement with previous calculations in terms of effective lagrangians ( of the chiral perturbation theory form ) for @xmath7 . 
 this includes the fact that the quark number density increases from zero at @xmath126 . 
 as @xmath0 becomes large , this relationship with effective lagrangians is no longer valid . both chiral and diquark 
 condensates decrease towards zero as @xmath0 becomes large . 
 however , because at least part of this is due to the fact that @xmath95 saturates at 2 fermions / site , a finite lattice spacing artifact , and because we see large finite size effects in the condensates for these @xmath0 values , studies at smaller lattice spacings as well as on larger lattices would be needed to determine how much of this observed high @xmath0 behaviour is real . 
 we are currently extending these calculations to lower quark mass ( @xmath63 ) where we should be able to measure the complete spectrum of goldstone and pseudo - goldstone bosons . 
 for this @xmath120 , the pion mass should be half that at @xmath62 and the assumptions of the effective lagrangian approach should have more validity , allowing a more quantitative analysis . 
 in addition , there is a larger range of @xmath127 between @xmath75 and the turnover point . 
 this means we can hope to measure the critical index @xmath128 for this transition . 
 ( preliminary attempts to extract this index from short runs at relatively strong coupling were reported in our letter on finite @xmath25 and @xmath0 . ) 
 let us now compare 2-colour qcd with 3-colour qcd , at finite @xmath0 . 
 most of this discussion is condensed from the published literature @xcite . since for 2-colour qcd , 
 the diquark condensate is a colour singlet , the spontaneous breaking of quark number is realized in the goldstone mode . 
 this contrasts with true ( 3-colour ) qcd where the condensate is , of necessity , coloured and the symmetry breaking is realized in the higgs mode . to see similarities , we consider the mode of symmetry - breaking for normal qcd with 2 light quark flavours . here 
 the expected condensate is a flavour singlet and a colour anti - triplet , i.e. antisymmetric in both flavour and colour . 
 the pattern of colour breaking is @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 refer to quark number before and after the breaking . 
 the 5 gluons corresponding to symmetries broken by the condensate , gain masses via the higgs mechanism by combining with the 5 would - be goldstone bosons associated with colour / quark - number breaking . 
 with respect to the remnant @xmath132 colour symmetry , the condensate is a flavour _ and _ colour singlet . 
 this is precisely the condensate that would be formed from the 2 quarks which are in a colour doublet with respect to this unbroken @xmath132 ( the third quark is a singlet with respect to this group ) if we ignored the interactions of the gluons which gain masses due to the higgs mechanism . 
 since the gluon masses produced from the goldstone bosons produced in this manner are of order @xmath133 , ignoring such light particle interactions is presumably a rather drastic approximation . 
 however , one might hope that it has at least qualitative validity . 
 ( note that @xmath134 is of the order of @xmath135  mev , @xmath136 , giving gluon masses of the same order of magnitude as previous estimates . ) 
 since this remnant @xmath132 theory is also at finite @xmath0 this condensate spontaneously breaks only 1 symmetry , quark number . 
 as seen above , the goldstone boson associated with this breaking gives mass to one of the gluons via the higgs mechanism . 
 finally , we note that with an appropriate reinterpretation of the fields , 2-colour qcd with a finite chemical potential for quark number can be reinterpreted as 2-colour qcd with a finite chemical potential for isospin . 
 it is clear that one can simulate true 3-colour qcd for 2 flavours with a finite chemical potential for isospin . 
 such a program is underway . 
 the 2-colour theory can be used as a guide to the pattern of symmetry breaking and what to expect .

16,"the dipole - dipole interaction is ubiquitous in physics and for example responsible for the ever present van der waals force . 
 it is also important for envisaged quantum computers based on atoms or ions in traps . 
 considerable interest in the literature has also been aroused by its cooperative effects on the radiative behavior of atoms @xcite . in an as yet unexplained experiment @xcite with two and three ba@xmath0 ions , which exhibit macroscopic light and dark periods , a large fraction of double and triple jumps was reported , i.e. jumps by two or three intensity steps within a short resolution time . 
 this fraction was orders of magnitudes larger than for independent ions . 
 the quantitative explanation of such a large cooperative effect for distances of the order of ten wave lengths of the strong transition has been found difficult @xcite . 
 experiments with other ions showed no observable cooperative effects @xcite , in particular none were seen for hg@xmath0 for a distance of about 15 wave lengths @xcite . 
 more recently , an unexpected high number of simultaneous quantum jumps in a linear chain of trapped ca@xmath0 ions was reported @xcite while no such effects were found in another experiment @xcite using the same ion species and a similar setup 
 .    systems with macroscopic light and dark periods can provide a sensitive test for cooperative effects of the dipole - dipole interaction . 
 these periods can occur for multi - level systems where the electron is essentially shelved for some time in a meta - stable state without photon emission @xcite . for two v systems with macroscopic light and dark periods 
 the effect of the dipole - dipole interaction was investigated numerically in ref . 
 @xcite and analytically in ref . 
 @xcite and shown to be up to 30% in the double jump rate compared to independent systems . 
 monitoring the dipole - dipole interaction of two v systems via quantum jumps of individual atoms was investigated in ref . 
 the experimental systems of refs . 
 @xcite are , however , not in the v configuration so that the results of ref . 
 @xcite do not directly apply . 
 the experiment of ref . 
 @xcite used two hg@xmath0 ions , with the relevant three levels as in fig . 
 [ dsystem ] , which we call a d configuration .    from a theoretical point of view two such systems were studied in ref . 
 @xcite for the special case @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the distance and the wave lengths refer to the respective transitions of fig . 
 [ dsystem ] , and for this case no cooperative effects were found . 
 the general case will be treated explicitly further below . 
 the cooperative effects found here are of similar magnitude as for v systems , and for distances of the above range the result of ref . 
 @xcite is confirmed . 
 our results are also in agreement with the experimentally observed absence of cooperative effects for distances of about 15 wave lengths @xcite .    the levels of ba@xmath0 used in the experiment of refs . 
 @xcite are depicted in fig . 
 [ 5niveau ] ( a ) . 
 the ground state @xmath3 and the two upper states @xmath4 and @xmath5 constitute a strongly driven fluorescing @xmath6 system which provides the light periods . 
 only when the system is in the ground state can the weak incoherent driving of the @xmath3 - @xmath7 transition populate the meta - stable @xmath5 state , with ensuing dark period . 
 therefore the details of the two upper states of the @xmath6 system play no significant role for the transition to a dark period , and therefore these two states are here replaced by an _ effective _ single level . 
 this leads to the four - level configuration of fig . 
 [ 5niveau ] ( b ) . 
 the present paper is , to our knowledge , the first to theoretically investigate possible cooperative effects for two such four - level systems . 
 surprisingly , these effects turn out to be much smaller than for two v systems for distances @xmath8 , and this shows that cooperative effects sensitively depend on how the meta - stable level is populated . 
 our results for two four - level configurations are at odds with the experimental findings of ref . 
 @xcite on the magnitude of double jump rates for two ba@xmath0 ions @xcite . 
 the methods presented in this paper can be carried over to describe the ca@xmath0 experiments of refs . 
 @xcite although this would of course require the use of a different level system . 
 the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ 2dpert ] 
 we treat two dipole - dipole interacting d systems and explicitly calculate the transition rates between the various light and dark periods as well as the double jump rate . 
 this is done by means of bloch equations . in section [ 4level ] 
 the method is carried over to two four - level systems of fig . 
 [ 5niveau ] ( b ) and the transition rates are calculated . in the appendix a direct quantum jump approach @xcite 
 is outlined for two d systems . 
 the d configuration , as displayed in fig . 
 [ dsystem ] , is a model of the level system of @xmath9 used in the experiments of refs . 
 @xcite . the transition @xmath10 is driven by a strong laser . 
 level @xmath11 can also decay via a slow transition to the meta - stable level @xmath12 . 
 for simplicity all transitions are treated as dipole transitions .    in the following 
 we will investigate two dipole - interacting d systems a fixed distance @xmath2 apart and calculate the transition rates between the three types of fluorescence periods . 
 this will be done in this section by means of bloch equations . in the appendix 
 the efficient quantum jump approach will be applied to two d systems , not only confirming the bloch equation result but also giving higher - order terms . for simplicity 
 the laser direction will be taken as perpendicular to the line joining the two systems . 
 rabi frequency and einstein coefficients satisfy @xmath13 it is convenient to use a dicke basis , @xmath14 in fig . 
 [ 2dniveaus ] ( a ) the level configuration for two d systems is displayed in this basis , with the slow decays neglected , while in fig . 
 [ 2dniveaus ] ( b ) only the slow decays are shown . from fig . 
 [ 2dniveaus ] ( a ) it is seen that without slow decays ( i.e. for @xmath15 ) the configuration decouples into three independent subspaces , denoted by @xmath16 , with @xmath17    by means of the conditional hamiltonian , @xmath18 , and the reset operation , @xmath19 , the bloch equations can be written in the form @xcite @xmath20 + \mathcal{r}(\rho)~.\ ] ] for two d systems one finds by the same method as in refs .

 for maximal effect we take @xmath27 in the following . 
 the real part of @xmath23 leads to changes of the decay constants and the imaginary part to a level shift in the dicke basis , as seen from the expression for @xmath28 . 
 the reset operation can be written in the form @xmath29 , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath30 to determine the transition rates we write eq . 
 ( [ bloch ] ) in a liouvillean form as @xmath31 where the super - operator @xmath32 is a perturbation depending on the small parameters , and employ the following important property of the time development . 
 starting with an initial state in one of the subspaces @xmath33 , the system will rapidly  on a time scale of @xmath34 and @xmath35approach one of the quasi - stationary states @xmath36 . 
 thereafter  for times much larger than @xmath34 and @xmath35 , but much smaller than @xmath37 and @xmath38small populations in the other subspaces will build up until eventually , on a time scale of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the true stationary state is approached . 
 hence we consider a time @xmath39 with @xmath40 and calculate @xmath41 for initial @xmath42 . 
 the quasi - invariant states are easily calculated from @xmath43 as @xmath44 \nonumber \\ 
 \mbox{where } \qquad     n & = & ( a_3 ^ 2 + 2\omega_3 ^ 2 + 4\delta_3 ^ 2)^2 \nonumber \\ & & \hspace{-1.5 cm }     { } + ( a_3 ^ 2 + 4\delta_3 ^ 2)(|c_3|^2 +    2a_3\text{re}\,c_3 + 4\delta_3\text{im}\,c_3 ) \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] as in ref . 
 @xcite one has in perturbation theory @xmath45 but , unlike ref . 
 @xcite , @xmath46 is not a superposition of just the eigenstates for nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath47 but also of the @xmath48 s . 
 we therefore decompose @xmath46 into a superposition of all eigenstates ( matrices ) of @xmath47 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 contains the contributions from the eigenstates for nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath47 . for later use 
 we note that these eigenvalues are of the order of @xmath51 and @xmath52 . 
 the coefficients @xmath53 can easily be determined by means of the reciprocal ( or dual ) eigenstates where only those for eigenvalue @xmath54 of @xmath47 are needed . 
 they are denoted by @xmath55 and are defined through @xmath56 @xmath57 the latter means @xmath58 , with the adjoint @xmath59 defined with respect to a scalar product given by @xmath60 
 . then one has @xmath61 the reciprocals @xmath55 are easily determined as follows . since the bloch equations conserve the trace one has @xmath62 for any @xmath63 . 
 thus @xmath64 for any @xmath63 and therefore @xmath65 . 
 now @xmath66 can be written as a sum of terms purely from @xmath67 , and @xmath68 and , since the subspaces are invariant under @xmath47 , these terms must be annihilated by @xmath59 individually . 
 this yields @xmath69 since the sum of the right - hand sides indeed yields @xmath66 and the normalization condition of eq . 
 ( [ norm ] ) is fulfilled . from eq . 
 ( [ alpha ] ) one then obtains the @xmath53 . inserting now @xmath46 into eq . 
 ( [ rhodeltata1 ] ) one obtains    @xmath70    where for the @xmath50 term the upper integration limit can be extended to infinity since @xmath50 belongs to nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath47 and is therefore rapidly damped . 
 now , @xmath71 is of the order of @xmath35 and @xmath34 on @xmath50 , and thus the last term in eq . 
 ( [ rhotdeltata ] ) is of the order of @xmath72 which is much smaller than @xmath73 , by eq . 
 ( [ rela3a1 ] ) . 
 therefore the last term in eq . 
 ( [ rhotdeltata ] ) can be neglected , and this equation then reveals that the @xmath53 s have the meaning of transition rates from subspace @xmath33 to @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath75    the transition rates are now obtained from eqs . 
 ( [ pij ] ) , ( [ alpha ] ) , and ( [ rho0dark])-([rho0outer ] ) as    @xmath76    and    @xmath77}{[a_3 ^ 2 +      2\omega_3 ^ 2 + 4\delta_3 ^ 2]^2 + [ a^2_3 + 4\delta^2_3][|c_3|^2 +      2a_3\text{re}\,c_3 + 4\delta_3\text{im}\,c_3 ] } \nonumber \\    & = & \frac{2a_2\omega_3 ^ 2}{a_3 ^ 2 + 2\omega_3 ^ 2 + 4\delta_3 ^ 2}\left[1      - 2\text{re}\,c_3\frac{a_3(a_3 ^ 2 + 4\delta_3 ^ 2)}{(a_3 ^ 2 +        2\omega_3 ^ 2 + 4\delta_3 ^ 2)^2 } -      4\text{im}\,c_3\frac{\delta_3(a_3 ^ 2 + 4\delta_3 ^ 2)}{(a_3 ^ 2 +        2\omega_3 ^ 2 + 4\delta_3 ^ 2)^2 } \right ] + \mathcal{o}(c_3 ^ 2)~.\end{aligned}\ ] ]    one sees that , for two d systems , only @xmath78 depends on the dipole coupling constants @xmath79 in first order . 
 this contrasts with two v systems where both @xmath78 and @xmath80 depend on @xmath79 . 
 the physical reason for this is that transitions between bright periods for two d systems are due to decays and not due to the laser . 
 hence the transition rates should essentially be governed by the einstein coefficients of these decays on the one hand and by the population of the states in the initial subsystem on the other hand . 
 therefore the parameter @xmath79 enters only through the quasi - stationary state @xmath36 of the initial subsystem . the absence of a linear @xmath81 and @xmath82 dependence 
 can be understood from fig . 
 [ 2dniveaus ] ( b ) as follows . for most slow transitions between two subspaces 
 there are two channels with rates @xmath83 so that @xmath84 cancels . 
 states with a single decay channel lie in @xmath85 and , by symmetry , they appear in pairs with different sign of @xmath84 .    from the transition 
 rates @xmath86 one obtains the double jump rate , @xmath87 , by the formula @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the defining small time interval for a double jump . 
 significant cooperative effects occur only as long as @xmath52 and @xmath22 are at least an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath51 . 
 when compared to non interacting systems , the cooperative effects are up to 30% for distances between one and two wave lengths and 5% around ten wave wave lengths , similar as for two v systems . for longer distances they are practically absent and this is consistent with the experimental results of ref . 
 [ 2dp21nds ] shows @xmath78 and @xmath87 versus the relative distance @xmath90 for typical parameters , where @xmath91 is the wave length of the strong transition . 
 our explicit results for arbitrary @xmath2 confirm the large - distance result of ref . 
 @xcite who argued that for @xmath92 cooperative effects are `` suppressed by the rapid decay on the fast transition '' . 
 in fact , we find in the appendix that these effects are only to first order independent of the coupling parameter @xmath82 ; the second order contributions in @xmath82 are , however , negligible for the experimental values of ref .

 the @xmath94 transition is driven weakly and incoherently by a lamp , while the @xmath95 transition is driven coherently by a strong laser .

 now the procedure is similar as for the d system . 
 the liouvillean @xmath47 possesses three ( quasi- ) stationary states @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 which coincide with those for the d systems in eqs . 
 ( [ rho0dark]-[rho0outer ] ) and which are associated with the dark and the two bright periods . as before , one calculates @xmath41 as in eq . 
 ( [ rhodeltata1 ] ) and decomposes @xmath46 as in eq . 
 ( [ l1rho0 ] ) . 
 now , however , the reciprocals @xmath55 are more difficult to determine since @xmath109 can decay into @xmath110 as well as @xmath12 . 
 an exact solution of @xmath111 is rather elaborate . 
 we therefore decompose @xmath112 and , by maple , have calculated @xmath113 to first order in perturbation theory with respect to @xmath82 and @xmath114 , with the same constraint as in eq . 
 ( [ norm ] ) . 
 the lengthy result will not be given here explicitly . 
 the transition rates are again given by @xmath115 and one obtains for two dipole - interacting four - level systems of fig .

 these results for two four - level systems show great similarity with those for the two d systems of the proceeding section . in both cases 
 only @xmath78 depends to first order on @xmath79 , the coupling parameter associated with the laser - driven transition . 
 however , cooperative effects are significantly smaller for the two four - level systems . for fixed laser detuning , 
 the effect of @xmath79 becomes maximal for @xmath120 . 
 for this value of @xmath52 , fig . 
 [ 24nivp21nds ] shows the transition rate @xmath78 from a double intensity period to a unit - intensity period and the double jump rate @xmath87 over the relative distance @xmath90 , with the other parameters as in the experiment @xcite . despite the optimal choice of the rabi frequency , @xmath52 , the deviations from the value for non - interacting systems are very small . 
 already for a distance of about a wave length @xmath91 , they are not more than @xmath121 for @xmath78 when compared to non interacting systems , while for @xmath87 they are less than 1 . 
 we have investigated the effect of the dipole - dipole interaction for two fluorescing systems with macroscopic light and dark periods , first for three - level d configurations and then for four - level systems . 
 the three - level d configuration models the relevant levels of hg@xmath0 used in the experiments of ref . 
 @xcite , and the four - level configuration is an effective model for ba@xmath0 , used in the experiments of ref .  @xcite . for these systems 
 one has macroscopic light and dark periods , and their statistics can be a sensitive test of the dipole - dipole interaction . 
 we have explicitly calculated the transition rates between the different light and dark periods by employing bloch equations as well as a direct quantum jump approach . from the transition 
 rates the double jump rates are obtained .    for two d systems the effect of the dipole - dipole interaction is of similar magnitude as for two v system investigated earlier @xcite and shown to be up to 30 % for distances of the order of a wave length of the strong transition and about 5% around ten wave lengths , when compared to independent systems . for longer distances 
 they are practically absent and this is in agreement with the experimental results of ref . 
 we have also recovered the special case of ref . 
 @xcite where distances satisfying @xmath1 were considered and where an argument for the non dependence on the dipole coupling constant @xmath82 was given . here 
 we have shown that this holds to first order and that the explicitly determined second order terms are negligibly small . 
 for the effective model of two ba@xmath0 systems our results yield very small and hardly observable cooperative effects for the double jump rate . 
 this is at odds with experimental result in ref . 
 our method also applies to three ba@xmath0 ions , but this is more tedious and requires another paper . 
 also a theoretical investigation of the experiments with ca@xmath0 @xcite is possible with our method . for this 
 the calculations have to be carried over to a level scheme modeling that of ca@xmath0 . 
 a further conclusion of our work is the observation that the magnitude of cooperative effects due to the dipole - dipole interaction sensitively depends on how the meta - stable level is populated . 
 the procedure will first be explained for a single @xmath122 system which has just two types of periods , light and dark ones . from its level configuration in fig . 
 [ dsystem ] it is evident that the onset of a dark period is preceded by a photon from the @xmath123 transition , with frequency @xmath124 . 
 hence , starting at @xmath125 in @xmath110 , the probability density for the next photon to occur at time @xmath126 and to come from the @xmath123 transition is @xmath127 since @xmath28 gives the time development between photon emissions @xcite . 
 then its time integral , @xmath128 is the probability for the next emitted photon to come from the @xmath123 transition . 
 now , let the photon rate in a light period be denoted by @xmath129 . then , after each photon of the light period the system is reset to the ground state and thereafter , with probability @xmath130 , emits a photon from the @xmath131 this can be carried over to two dipole interacting @xmath122 systems as follows . 
 we consider an emission trajectory and assume to be in a particular intensity period , of unit intensity , say . 
 in contrast to a single @xmath122 system , the reset state after a photon emission in this period is not always quite the same , but it is reasonable to start from @xmath107 and to use @xmath132 as an average reset state . 
 the transition to a double - intensity period is marked by a photon from the @xmath133 transition , and therefore the probability density for such a transition , starting from the above reset state , is @xmath134 integration over @xmath126 gives the total transition probability , denoted by @xmath135 . 
 the photon rate in a period of unit intensity is that of two dipole interacting two level systems and is given by @xcite      thus @xmath80 is given by @xmath137 in a similar way one obtains @xmath119 and @xmath78 . 
 the transition rate @xmath118 can be directly read off from the no - photon probability @xmath138 . 
 one obtains the same results as in section [ 2dpert ] when one expands in the small parameters . in the case 
 @xmath92 one can put @xmath139 and one obtains for example @xmath140","the mutual dipole - dipole interaction of atoms in a trap can affect their fluorescence . 
 extremely large effects were reported for double jumps between different intensity periods in experiments with two and three ba@xmath0 ions for distances in the range of about ten wave lengths of the strong transition while no effects were observed for hg@xmath0 at 15 wave lengths . in this theoretical paper 
 we study this question for configurations with three and four levels which model those of hg@xmath0 and ba@xmath0 , respectively . for two systems in the hg@xmath0 configuration 
 we find cooperative effects of up to 30% for distances around one or two wave lengths , about 5% around ten wave lengths , and , for larger distances in agreement with experiments , practically none . 
 this is similar for two v systems .

17,"a cluster category is a certain 2-calabi - yau orbit category of the derived category of a hereditary abelian category . 
 cluster categories were introduced in @xcite in order to give a categorical model for the combinatorics of fomin - zelevinsky cluster algebras @xcite . 
 they are triangulated @xcite and admit ( cluster-)tilting objects , which model the clusters of a corresponding ( acyclic ) cluster algebra @xcite . each cluster in a fixed cluster algebra comes together with a finite quiver , and in the categorical model this quiver is in fact the gabriel quiver of the corresponding tilting object @xcite . 
 a principal ingredient in the construction of a cluster algebra is quiver mutation . 
 it controls the exchange procedure which gives a rule for producing a new cluster variable and hence a new cluster from a given cluster . 
 exchange is modeled by cluster categories in the acyclic case @xcite in terms of a mutation rule for tilting objects , i.e. a rule for replacing an indecomposable direct summand in a tilting object with another indecomposable rigid object , to get a new tilting object . 
 quiver mutation describes the relation between the gabriel quivers of the corresponding tilting objects . 
 analogously to the definition of the cluster category , for a positive integer @xmath0 , it is natural to define a certain @xmath1-calabi - yau orbit category of the derived category of a hereditary abelian category . 
 this is called the _ 
 @xmath0-cluster category_. implicitly , @xmath0-cluster categories was first studied in @xcite , and their ( cluster-)tilting objects have been studied in @xcite . 
 combinatorial descriptions of @xmath0-cluster categories in dynkin type @xmath2 and @xmath3 are given in @xcite .    in cluster categories 
 the mutation rule for tilting objects is described in terms of certain triangles called _ exchange triangles_. by @xcite the existence of exchange triangles generalizes to @xmath0-cluster categories . 
 it was shown in @xcite that there are exactly @xmath1 non - isomorphic complements to an almost complete tilting object , and that they are determined by the @xmath1 exchange triangles defined in @xcite . 
 the aim of this paper is to give a combinatorial description of mutation in @xmath0-cluster categories . _ a priori _ 
 , one might expect to be able to do this by keeping track of the gabriel quivers of the tilting objects . 
 however , it is easy to see that the gabriel quivers do not contain enough information .    we proceed to associate to a tilting object a quiver each of whose arrows has an associated colour @xmath4 . the arrows with colour 0 form the gabriel quiver of the tilting object . 
 we then define a mutation operation on coloured quivers and show that it is compatible with mutation of tilting objects . 
 a consequence is that the effect of an arbitrary sequence of mutations on a tilting object in an @xmath0-cluster category can be calculated by a purely combinatorial procedure . 
 our definition of a coloured quiver associated to a tilting object makes sense in any @xmath1-calabi - yau category , such as for example those studied in @xcite . 
 we hope that our constructions may shed some light on mutation of tilting objects in this more general setting .    in section 1 , we review some elementary facts about higher cluster categories . in section 2 , we explain how to define the coloured quiver of a tilting object , we define coloured quiver mutation , and we state our main theorem . in sections 3 and 4 , we state some further lemmas about higher cluster categories , and we prove certain properties of the coloured quivers of tilting objects . 
 we prove our main result in sections 5 and 6 . in sections 7 and 8 
 we point out some applications . in section 9 
 we interpret our construction in terms of @xmath0-cluster complexes . in section 10 
 , we give an alternative algorithm for computing coloured quiver mutation . 
 section 11 discusses the example of @xmath0-cluster categories of dynkin type @xmath2 , using the model developed by baur and marsh @xcite .

 we let @xmath53 denote the @xmath5-space of irreducible maps @xmath54 in a krull - schmidt @xmath5-category @xmath55 . 
 the following crucial result is proved in @xcite and @xcite . 
 [ p : number ] there are , up to isomorphism , @xmath1 complements of an almost complete tilting object . 
 let @xmath51 be an indecomposable direct summand in an @xmath0-cluster tilting object @xmath56 . 
 the complements of @xmath57 are denoted @xmath58 for @xmath59 , where @xmath60 . by @xcite 
 , there are @xmath1 exchange triangles @xmath61 here the @xmath62 are in @xmath63 and the maps @xmath64 ( resp . 
 @xmath65 ) are minimal left ( resp . 
 right ) @xmath63-approximations , and hence not split mono or split epi . note that by minimality , the maps @xmath64 and @xmath65 have no proper zero summands . 
 we first recall the definition of quiver mutation , formulated in @xcite in terms of skew - symmetric matrices . 
 let @xmath66 be a quiver with vertices @xmath67 and with no loops or oriented two - cycles , where @xmath68 denotes the number of arrows from @xmath13 to @xmath69 . 
 let @xmath70 be a vertex in @xmath71 . 
 then , a new quiver @xmath72 is defined by the following data    @xmath73 it is easily verified that this definition is equivalent to the one of fomin - zelevinsky . 
 now we consider coloured quivers . 
 let @xmath0 be a positive integer . 
 an @xmath0-coloured ( multi-)quiver @xmath71 consists of vertices @xmath67 and coloured arrows @xmath74 , where @xmath75 . 
 let @xmath76 denote the number of arrows from @xmath13 to @xmath70 of colour @xmath77 . 
 we will consider coloured quivers with the following additional conditions .    * 
 no loops : @xmath78 for all @xmath79 . 
 * monochromaticity : if @xmath80 , then @xmath81 for @xmath82 * skew - symmetry : @xmath83 . 
 we will define an operation on a coloured quiver @xmath71 satisfying the above conditions . 
 let @xmath70 be a vertex in @xmath71 and let @xmath84 be the coloured quiver defined by    @xmath85    in an @xmath0-cluster category @xmath20 , for every tilting object @xmath86 , with the @xmath50 indecomposable , we will define a corresponding @xmath0-coloured quiver @xmath87 , as follows . 
 let @xmath88 be two non - isomorphic indecomposable direct summands of the @xmath0-cluster tilting object @xmath41 and let @xmath89 denote the multiplicity of @xmath90 in @xmath91 . 
 we define the @xmath0-coloured quiver @xmath87 of @xmath41 to have vertices @xmath13 corresponding to indecomposable direct summands @xmath50 , and @xmath92 . 
 note , in particular , that the @xmath93-coloured arrows are the arrows from the gabriel quiver for the endomorphism ring of @xmath41 .    by definition 
 , @xmath87 satisfies condition ( i ) . 
 we show in section [ s : higher ] that ( ii ) is satisfied ( this also follows from @xcite ) , and in section [ s : symmetry ] that ( iii ) is also satisfied .    the aim of this paper is to prove the following theorem , which is a generalization of the main result of @xcite . 
 [ t : main ] let @xmath86 and @xmath94 be @xmath0-tilting objects , where there is an exchange triangle @xmath95

 @xmath97 the coloured quiver of a tilting object @xmath41 is given by @xmath98 and @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the number of arrows in the gabriel quiver of @xmath41

 .    tilting objects in @xmath111 give rise to partial tilting modules in @xmath9 , where a _ 
 partial tilting module _ @xmath28 in @xmath9 , is a module with @xmath112 . 
 [ l : partial ]    * when @xmath41 is a tilting object in @xmath36 , then each @xmath113 is a partial tilting module in @xmath9 . * the endomorphism ring of a partial tilting module has no oriented cycles in its ordinary quiver .

 \(b ) follows from the fact that @xmath124 ) \neq 0 $ ] , since in the exchange triangles , the @xmath125 are not split mono and ( c ) follows from ( b ) . 
 considering the two different possible distributions of complements , we obtain from ( c ) that if @xmath126 and @xmath127 and @xmath128 , then @xmath129 . 
 consider the case @xmath130 . 
 we can assume @xmath131 , since else the statement is void .

 this holds since @xmath136 is a partial tilting object in @xmath10 , and so there are no cycles in the endomorphism ring , by lemma [ l : partial ] . 
 hence also @xmath137 follows , and this finishes the proof for ( d ) . 
 for ( e ) we first apply @xmath138 to the exchange triangle @xmath139 and consider the corresponding long - exact sequence , to obtain that @xmath140 ) = \begin{cases } k & \text { if $ t = 1 $ } \\ 0 & \text { if $ t=0 $ or $ t \in \{2 , \dots , m \}$ } \end{cases}.\ ] ] now consider @xmath141)$ ] . when @xmath142 , we have that @xmath143 ) \simeq { \operatorname{hom}\nolimits}(t_i^{(c+u+1 ) } , t_i^{(c)}[v+1 ] ) \simeq \\ { \operatorname{hom}\nolimits}(t_i^{(c-1 ) } , t_i^{(c)}[v+m - u ] ) \simeq { \operatorname{hom}\nolimits}(t_i^{(c ) } , t_i^{(c-1)}[1+u - v ] ) .

 [ l : div2 ] the following statements are equivalent    * @xmath146 ) = 0 $ ] * @xmath90 is not a direct summand in @xmath147 * @xmath50 is not a direct summand in @xmath148    furthermore , @xmath149 ) = 0 $ ] for @xmath150 . 
 note that @xmath151 , so ( b ) and ( c ) are equivalent . 
 consider the exact sequence @xmath152 ) \to { \operatorname{hom}\nolimits}(t_i^{(c ) } , b_j^{(0)}[1 ] ) \to \\   { \operatorname{hom}\nolimits}(t_i^{(c ) } , t_j^{(1)}[1 ] ) \to { \operatorname{hom}\nolimits}(t_i^{(c ) } , t_j^{(0)}[2 ] ) \to \end{gathered}\ ] ] coming from applying @xmath153 to the exchange triangle @xmath154 the first and fourth terms are always zero . using [ l : div](e ) we get that the second term ( and hence the third ) is non - zero if and only if @xmath155 and @xmath50 is a direct summand in @xmath148 . 
 ( @xcite)[l : composing ] for @xmath156 , the composition @xmath157   \circ h_k^{(v-2)}[2 ] \circ \cdots \circ   h_k^{(v - l+1)}[l-1 ] \colon t_k^{(v ) } \to t_k^{(v - l)}[l]\ ] ] is non - zero and a basis for @xmath158)$ ] .    for @xmath97 , 
 see @xcite . 
 assume @xmath159 . 
 for the first claim see @xcite , while the second claim then follows from lemma [ l : div](e ) . 
 we include an independent proof of the following crucial property . 
 @xcite [ l : disjoint ] @xmath160 and @xmath161 has no common non - zero direct summands whenever @xmath162 .    when @xmath97 , this is proved in @xcite . 
 assume @xmath163 . 
 we consider two cases , @xmath164 or @xmath165 . 
 consider first the case @xmath166 . without loss of generality 
 we can assume @xmath167 and @xmath168 , and that @xmath169 . 
 assume that there exists a ( non - zero ) indecomposable @xmath170 , which is a direct summand in @xmath171 and in @xmath172 . 
 we have that @xmath173 by lemma [ l : div](b ) . 
 assume first @xmath174 . 
 then the exchange triangle @xmath175 is induced from the degree 0 part of the derived category , and hence from an exact sequence in @xmath9 . 
 then the endomorphism ring of the partial tilting module @xmath176 has a cycle , which is a contradiction to lemma [ l : partial ] . 
 assume now that @xmath177 . 
 then @xmath178 , where 0 can only occur if @xmath179 . if @xmath180 , then clearly @xmath181 , and hence the partial tilting module @xmath182 contains a cycle , which is a contradiction . 
 assume that @xmath183 ( and hence @xmath179 ) . then @xmath184 . if @xmath181 , we get a contradiction as in the previous case . 
 if @xmath185 , consider the exchange triangle @xmath186 which is induced from an exact sequence in @xmath9 . 
 hence there is a _ non - zero _ 
 map @xmath187 obtained by composing @xmath188 with the monomorphism @xmath189 , and thus there are cycles in the endomorphism ring of the partial tilting module @xmath190 , a contradiction . 
 this finishes the case with @xmath191 . 
 assume now that @xmath192 . 
 then we have @xmath193 . 
 since @xmath194 and @xmath195 , we have by lemma [ l : div](c ) that @xmath196 . 
 so without loss of generality we can assume @xmath197 . 
 assume that @xmath198 . then @xmath199 using lemma [ l : div](c ) and the fact that @xmath194 
 . then also @xmath200 . 
 but @xmath201 , so @xmath202 , contradicting the fact that @xmath195 . 
 @xmath87 satisfies condition ( ii ) . 
 let @xmath203 be a tilting object . in this section we show that the coloured quiver @xmath87 satisfies condition ( iii ) . 
 [ p : symmetry ] with the notation of the previous section , we have @xmath204 .    by lemma [ l : div2 ] 
 we only need to consider the case @xmath205 . 
 it is enough to show that @xmath206 . 
 we first prove    [ l : non - van ] let @xmath207 be irreducible in @xmath208 . then the composition @xmath209 
 \circ \gamma_i^{(0,c)}[-c ]   \colon t_j^{(c)}[-c ] \to t_i^{(m - c+1)}$ ] is non - zero . 
 we have already assumed @xmath210 . 
 assume @xmath211 \circ h_i^{(0)}[-c ] \colon t_j^{(c)}[-c ] \to t_i^{(0)}[-c ] \to t_i^{(m)}[-c+1]\ ] ] is zero . 
 this means that @xmath212 must factor through @xmath213 . 
 since @xmath50 is by assumption a summand in @xmath214 , we have that @xmath50 is not a summand in @xmath148 by proposition [ l : disjoint ] . 
 since @xmath215 , we have that @xmath90 is not a direct summand in @xmath147 . 
 this means that @xmath216 is not irreducible in @xmath208 , a contradiction . 
 so @xmath209 \circ h_i^{(0)}[-c ] \colon t_j^{(c)}[-c ] \to t_i^{(m)}[-c+1]$ ] is non - zero . 
 assume @xmath217 . 
 if the composition @xmath209 \circ h_i^{(0)}[-c ] \circ h_i^{(m)}[-c+1]$ ] is zero , then @xmath209 \circ h_i^{(0)}[-c]$ ] factors through @xmath218 \to t_i^{(m)}[-c+1].\ ] ] we claim that @xmath219 , b_i^{(m-1)}[-c+1 ] ) \simeq { \operatorname{hom}\nolimits}(t_j^{(c ) } , b_i^{(m-1)}[1 ] ) = 0 $ ] . 
 this clearly holds if @xmath90 is not a summand of @xmath220 . 
 in addition we have that @xmath221 ) = 0 $ ] since @xmath217 , using lemma [ l : div](e ) . 
 this is a contradiction , and this argument can clearly be iterated to see that @xmath209 \circ \gamma_i^{(0,c)}[-c ]   \colon t_j^{(c)}[-c ] \to t_i^{(m - c+1)}$ ] is non - zero , using lemma [ l : div](e ) .    we now show that any irreducible map @xmath207 gives rise to an irreducible map @xmath222 
 .    consider the composition @xmath223 \overset{g_j^{(c)}[-c]}{\longrightarrow } t_j^{(c)}[-c ] \longrightarrow t_i^{(m - c+1)}.\ ] ] since @xmath50 is a summand in @xmath214 by assumption , it is not a summand in @xmath224 . 
 thus , @xmath224 is in @xmath225 . 
 since @xmath226)= 0 $ ] for any @xmath39 in @xmath227 , the composition vanishes .    using the exchange triangle @xmath223 \overset{g_j^{(c)}[-c]}{\longrightarrow } t_j^{(c)}[-c ] \overset{h_j^{(c)}[-c]}{\longrightarrow } t_j^{(c-1)}[-c+1],\ ] ] we see that @xmath209 \circ \gamma_i^{(0,c)}[-c ] \colon t_j^{(c)}[-c ] \to t_i^{(m - c+1)}$ ] factors through the map @xmath228 \overset{h_j^{(c)}[-c]}{\longrightarrow } t_j^{(c-1)}[-c+1]$ ] , i.e. there is a commutative diagram    @xmath229 \ar^{g_j^{(c)}[-c]}[r ]   & t_j^{(c)}[-c ] \ar^{h_j^{(c)}[-c]}[r ] \ar[d ] &   t_j^{(c-1)}[-c+1 ] \ar[r ]   \ar^{\phi_1}[dl ] &   \\ & t_i^{(m - c+1 ) } & & } \ ] ]    similarly , using the exchange triangle @xmath230 \overset{g_j^{(c-1)}[-c+1]}{\longrightarrow } t_j^{(c-1)}[-c+1 ] \overset{h_j^{(c-1)}[-c+1]}{\longrightarrow } t_j^{(c-2)}[-c+2]\ ] ] we obtain a map @xmath231 \to   t_i^{(m - c+1)}$ ]    repeating this argument @xmath79 times we obtain a map @xmath232 , such that @xmath233 \circ \phi_c = \alpha[-c ] \circ \gamma_i^{(0,c)}$ ]

 .    let @xmath238 be a minimal left @xmath239-approximation , with @xmath240 in @xmath241 and @xmath242 in @xmath243 . 
 let @xmath244 be as above , and factor it as @xmath245 since @xmath246 factors through @xmath247 $ ] , we have that @xmath233 \psi '' = 0 $ ] , so we have @xmath248(\psi ' \epsilon ' + \psi '' \epsilon'')= \gamma_j^{(c , c)}[-c ] \psi ' \epsilon'.\ ] ] hence , let we let @xmath249 and since the summands in @xmath250 are isomorphisms , it is clear that @xmath236 is irreducible . 
 next , assume @xmath251 is a basis for the space of irreducible maps from @xmath252 to @xmath50 . 
 then , by lemma [ l : non - van ] the set @xmath253 is also linearly independent . for each @xmath254 , consider the corresponding map @xmath255 , such that @xmath233 \circ \beta_t = \alpha_t[-c ] \circ \gamma_i^{(0,c)}$ ] , and which we by lemma [ l : irred ] can assume is irreducible . assume a non - trivial linear combination @xmath256 is zero 
 . then also @xmath257 \circ \beta_t ) =   \sum k_t \alpha_t \circ \gamma_i^{(0,c)}=0 $ ] . but 
 this contradicts lemma [ l : non - van ] since @xmath258 is irreducible . 
 hence it follows that @xmath259 is also linearly independent . 
 hence , in the exchange triangle @xmath260 , we have that @xmath90 appears with multiplicity at least @xmath261 in @xmath262 . 
 so , we have that @xmath206 , and the proof of the proposition is complete . 
 in this section we show how mutation in the vertex @xmath70 affects the complements of the almost complete tilting object @xmath263 . as 
 before , let @xmath264 be an @xmath0-tilting object , and let @xmath94 .    we need to consider @xmath265 \ar^{(e)}[r ] & t_j \ar^{(d)}[r ] & t_k } \ ] ] for all possible values of @xmath266 . however , we have the following restriction on the colour of arrows .    [ 
 p : limits ] assume @xmath267 and @xmath268 
 . then @xmath269 . 
 consider the exchange triangle @xmath270 . 
 note that @xmath90 is a direct summand in the middle term @xmath271 by the assumption that @xmath272 . 
 consider also the exchange triangle @xmath273 . 
 pick an arbitrary non - zero map @xmath274 , and consider the map @xmath275 . 
 it suffices to show that whenever @xmath276 , then @xmath277 is not irreducible in @xmath46 . 
 so assume that @xmath276 . 
 we claim that there is a commutative diagram @xmath278 \ar[d ] &   t_j \amalg x ' \ar[r ] \ar^{\left ( \begin{smallmatrix } h & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{smallmatrix } \right)}[d ] &    t_i^{(e+1 ) } \ar[r ] \ar[d ] & \\ 
 t_i^{(c ) } \ar[r ] & t_k \amalg z \ar[r ] & t_i^{(c+1 ) } \ar[r ] &   } \ ] ] where the rows are the exchange triangles . 
 the composition @xmath279 is zero since    * if @xmath280 @xmath281 by using @xmath276 and lemma [ l : div](e ) * if @xmath282 , there is no non - zero composition @xmath283    hence the leftmost vertical map exists , and then the rightmost map exists , using that @xmath20 is a triangulated category . 
 then , since @xmath284 , t_i^{(c ) } ) = 0 $ ] by lemma [ l : div](e ) , there is a map @xmath285 , such that @xmath286 . 
 hence there is map @xmath287 such that @xmath288 . by restriction 
 we get @xmath289    under the assumption @xmath290 we have that @xmath291 can not be irreducible in @xmath292 . 
 hence @xmath293 , where @xmath51 is not summand in @xmath294 . 
 also , by proposition [ l : disjoint ] we have that @xmath90 is not a summand in @xmath294 . 
 if @xmath295 was irreducible in @xmath296 , then there would be an irreducible map @xmath297 in @xmath298 , and since @xmath299 , this does not hold , by proposition [ l : disjoint ] . 
 hence , @xmath300 , where @xmath90 is not a direct summand of @xmath301 . also by proposition [ l : disjoint ] we have that @xmath51 is not a summand of @xmath301 . by ( [ factor ] ) , this shows that @xmath274 is not irreducible in @xmath46 . 
 let @xmath302 . 
 for @xmath303 , let @xmath304 denote the complements of @xmath305 , where there are exchange triangles @xmath306    we first want to compare @xmath304 with @xmath307 .    [ l : samecomp ] assume that @xmath308 for @xmath309 and that @xmath310 . 
 * for @xmath311 , the minimal left @xmath312-approximation @xmath313 is also an @xmath314-approximation . * for @xmath315

 hence the minimal left @xmath312-approximation @xmath313 is also an @xmath314-approximation , so we have proved ( a ) . 
 then ( b ) follows directly . 
 [ l : comp ] assume that @xmath321 and there are exchange triangles @xmath322 and @xmath323 where @xmath324 and @xmath325 , i.e. @xmath326 and @xmath327 , where @xmath51 is not isomorphic to any direct summand in @xmath328 .    * the composition @xmath329 is a left @xmath314-approximation .

 hence , by applying @xmath337 to the triangle ( [ i - tri ] ) we get that @xmath338 factors through @xmath339 . by applying @xmath337 to the triangle ( [ j - tri ] ) , and using that @xmath340 ) = 0 $ ] , we get that @xmath338 factors through @xmath341 . 
 this proves ( a ) . for ( b ) and ( c ) 
 we use the exchange triangles ( [ i - tri ] ) and ( [ j - tri ] ) and the octahedral axiom to obtain the commutative diagram of triangles    @xmath342 \ar@{=}[d ] & ( t_j)^p \amalg x \ar[r ] \ar[d ]             & t_i^{(e+1 ) } \ar[d ] \ar[r ] & \\

 note that the induced @xmath314-approximation is in general not minimal .

 we hence get that all maps @xmath361 , with @xmath45 in @xmath362 , factor through @xmath363 . 
 minimality is clear from the triangle ( [ octa - tri ] ) .

 the case where @xmath379 is directly from the definition . 
 the case where @xmath380 follows by condition ( ii ) for @xmath381 . for the rest of the proof 
 we assume @xmath382 . 
 we will divide the proof into four cases , where @xmath383 denotes the number of arrows from @xmath13 to @xmath70 , and @xmath384 .    * @xmath385 * @xmath386 , @xmath321 and @xmath387 * @xmath386 , @xmath321 and @xmath388 . * @xmath386 and @xmath389    note that in the three first cases , the formula reduces to @xmath390 and in the first two cases it further reduces to @xmath391    case i. 
 we first consider the situation where there is no coloured arrow @xmath392 , i.e. @xmath308 for all @xmath393 . 
 that is , we assume @xmath87 locally looks like this @xmath265   & t_j \ar^{(d)}[r ] & t_k } \ ] ] with @xmath394 arbitrary . 
 it is a direct consequence of proposition [ p : summarize ] that @xmath395 for all @xmath393 which shows that the formula holds . 
 +   + case ii . 
 we consider the setting where we assume @xmath87 locally looks like this @xmath265 \ar^{(e)}[r ] & t_j \ar^{(d)}[r ] & t_k } \ ] ] with @xmath321 and @xmath396 . 
 we then claim that we have the following , which shows that the formula holds .    in the above setting @xmath395 for all @xmath393 . 
 it follows directly from proposition [ p : summarize ] that @xmath395 for @xmath397 . 
 we claim that @xmath398 .    by lemma [ l : comp ] 
 we have the ( not necessarily minimal ) left @xmath314-approximation    @xmath399    first , assume that @xmath51 does not appear as a summand in @xmath326 , then the same holds for @xmath400 , and hence for @xmath401 which is a direct summand in @xmath400 
 .    next , assume @xmath51 appears as a summand in @xmath271 , and hence in @xmath39 . 
 then @xmath51 is by proposition [ l : disjoint ] not a summand in @xmath294 , and by lemma [ l : modtri ] we have that @xmath51 is also not a summand in @xmath331 . 
 therefore @xmath51 appears with the same multiplicity in @xmath271 as in @xmath401 , also in this case . 
 we now show that @xmath395 for @xmath402 .    if @xmath403 , then @xmath404 for @xmath402 and we are finished . 
 so assume @xmath405 , i.e. @xmath51 does not appear as a direct summand of @xmath39 . 
 consider the map @xmath406 we have that @xmath407 . by assumption , @xmath51 is not a direct summand in @xmath408 , and thus not in @xmath331 . 
 hence it follows that @xmath409 . 
 since , by proposition [ p : summarize ] we have for @xmath410 , that @xmath316 and the left @xmath411-approximation coincide with the left @xmath412-approximations of @xmath413 , it now follows that @xmath395 for all @xmath393 . 
 + case iii . 
 we now consider the setting with @xmath414 non - zero , @xmath388 and @xmath321 . 
 that is , we assume @xmath87 locally looks like this @xmath265 \ar^{(e)}[r ] & t_j \ar^{(0)}[r ] & t_k } \ ] ] where @xmath415 by proposition [ p : limits ] , and where there are @xmath416 arrows from @xmath50 to @xmath51 . 
 [ l : formulas ] in the above setting , we have that @xmath381 is given by    @xmath417    @xmath418    and    @xmath419    we first deal with the case where @xmath420 and @xmath421 . by assumption @xmath39 in the triangle ( [ i - tri ] ) 
 has @xmath422 copies of @xmath51 , so @xmath423 has @xmath424 copies of @xmath51 . hence to show ( [ form1 ] ) it is sufficient to show that @xmath331 in the triangle @xmath425 has no copies of @xmath51 . 
 this follows directly from the lemma [ l : modtri ] and the fact that @xmath51 ( by the assumption that @xmath421 and proposition [ l : disjoint ] ) is not a summand in @xmath294 . in this case 
 ( [ form2 ] ) and ( [ form3 ] ) follow directly from proposition [ l : disjoint ] . 
 consider the case with @xmath426 and @xmath427 . 
 we have that @xmath39 in the triangle ( [ i - tri ] ) does not have @xmath51 as a direct summand . 
 assume @xmath51 appears as a direct summand of @xmath331 with multiplicity @xmath428 . 
 we claim that @xmath429 . 
 assume first @xmath430 , then on one hand @xmath51 appears with multiplicity @xmath431 in @xmath432 . on 
 the other hand @xmath51 appears with multiplicity @xmath433 in @xmath401 . 
 this contradicts proposition [ l : disjoint ] . 
 hence @xmath429 .    therefore @xmath401 has @xmath434 copies of @xmath51 and ( [ form1 ] ) and ( [ form2 ] ) hold . if @xmath435 , then ( [ form3 ] ) follows directly from the above and proposition [ l : disjoint ] . in the case 
 @xmath436 , we also need to show that @xmath51 does not appear as a summand in @xmath437 for @xmath438 . 
 since @xmath439 , we have @xmath440 , and the result follows from proposition [ p : summarize ] . 
 now assume @xmath426 and @xmath441 . 
 assume @xmath442 , where @xmath51 is not a summand in @xmath443 . 
 now since @xmath444 with @xmath51 not a summand in @xmath328 , is a minimal left @xmath362-approximation , we have that @xmath445 and @xmath51 appears with multiplicity @xmath446 in the minimal left @xmath447-approximation of @xmath448 , hence @xmath51 can not appear as a summand in the minimal left @xmath375-approximation of @xmath449 . 
 hence @xmath450 , and we have completed the proof of ( [ form1 ] ) and ( [ form2 ] ) in this case . 
 the case ( [ form3 ] ) , i.e. @xmath451 follows from proposition [ l : disjoint ] . 
 + case iv . 
 we now consider the case with @xmath452 . 
 assume first there are no arrows from @xmath70 to @xmath69 . 
 then we can use the symmetry proved in proposition [ p : symmetry ] and reduce to case i. the formula is easily verified in this case . 
 assume @xmath453 , again we can use the symmetry , this time to reduce to case iii . 
 it is straightforward to verify that the formula holds also in this case . 
 assume now that @xmath454 , i.e. we need to consider the following case @xmath455 \ar@<0.6ex>^{(m)}[r ] & t_j \ar@<0.6ex>^{(0)}[r ] \ar@<0.6ex>^{(0)}[l ] & t_k \ar@<0.6ex>^{(m)}[l ]   \ar@<0.6ex>^{(m - c)}@/^3.5pc/[ll ] } \ ] ] now by proposition [ p : limits ] we have that @xmath79 is in @xmath456 . 
 assume there are @xmath457 @xmath77-coloured arrows    the coloured quiver of @xmath109 is of the form @xmath458 \ar@<0.6ex>^{(0)}[r ] & t_j^{(1 ) } \ar@<0.6ex>^{(m)}[r ] \ar@<0.6ex>^{(m)}[l ] & t_k \ar@<0.6ex>^{(0)}[l ]   \ar@<0.6ex>^{(m - c')}@/^3.5pc/[ll ] } \ ] ] and applying the symmetry of proposition [ p : symmetry ] we have that if @xmath421 , then @xmath459 by proposition [ p : limits ] . 
 hence for all @xmath460 we have that @xmath461 . 
 therefore it suffices to show that @xmath462 , for @xmath463 . 
 this is a direct consequence of the following . 
 assume we are in the above setting . 
 a map @xmath464 or @xmath465 is irreducible in @xmath46 if and only if it is irreducible in @xmath362 . 
 assume @xmath464 is not irreducible in @xmath362 , and that @xmath466 for some @xmath467 , with @xmath468 the indecomposable direct summands of @xmath45 . 
 note that by lemma [ l : div](a ) , we can assume that all @xmath469 and all @xmath470 are non - isomorphisms . if there is some index @xmath471 such that @xmath472 , the map @xmath470 factors through some @xmath473 in @xmath474 , since there are no @xmath475-coloured arrows @xmath476 or @xmath477 in the coloured quiver of @xmath41 . 
 this shows that @xmath464 is not irreducible in @xmath46 . 
 assume @xmath464 is not irreducible in @xmath46 , and that @xmath478 for some @xmath479 , with @xmath480 the indecomposable direct summands of @xmath481 . if there is some index @xmath471 such that @xmath482 , the map @xmath483 factors through @xmath484 , which is in @xmath485 , since there are no @xmath93-coloured arrows @xmath392 or @xmath486 in the coloured quiver of @xmath41 . 
 this shows that @xmath464 is not irreducible in @xmath362 .    by symmetry 
 , the same property holds for maps @xmath465 . 
 thus we have proven that the formula holds in all four cases , and this finishes the proof of theorem [ t : main ] . 
 an @xmath0-cluster - tilted algebra is an algebra given as @xmath487 for some tilting object @xmath41 in an @xmath0-cluster category @xmath488 . obviously , the subquiver of the coloured quiver of @xmath41 given by the @xmath93-coloured maps is the gabriel quiver of @xmath487 . 
 an application of our main theorem is that the quivers of the @xmath0-cluster - tilted algebras can be combinatorially determined via repeated ( coloured ) mutation . for this one 
 needs transitivity in the tilting graph of @xmath0-tilting objects . 
 more precisely , we need the following , which is also pointed out in @xcite .    any @xmath0-tilting object can be reached from any other @xmath0-tilting object via iterated mutation . 
 we sketch a proof for the convenience of the reader . 
 let @xmath109 be a tilting object in an @xmath0-cluster category @xmath20 of the hereditary algebra @xmath489 , and let @xmath490 be the @xmath491-cluster category of @xmath10 . 
 by @xcite , there is a tilting object @xmath41 of degree 0 , i.e. all direct summands in @xmath41 have degree 0 , such that @xmath41 can be reached from @xmath109 via mutation . 
 it is sufficient to show that the canonical tilting object @xmath10 can be reached from @xmath41 via mutation . 
 since @xmath41 is of degree 0 , it is induced from a @xmath10-tilting module . 
 especially @xmath41 is a tilting object in @xmath490 . since @xmath41 and @xmath10 are tilting objects in @xmath490 , by @xcite there are @xmath490-tilting objects @xmath492 , such that @xmath50 mutates to @xmath493 ( in @xmath490 ) for @xmath494 . 
 now each @xmath50 is induced by a tilting module for some @xmath495 where all @xmath496 are derived equivalent to @xmath497 . hence , each @xmath50 is easily seen to be an @xmath0-cluster tilting object . since @xmath493 differs from @xmath50 in only one summand the mutations in @xmath490 are also mutations in @xmath20 . 
 this concludes the proof . 
 a direct consequence of the transitivity is the following . 
 for an @xmath0-cluster category @xmath111 of the acyclic quiver @xmath71 , all quivers of @xmath0-cluster - tilted algebras are given by repeated coloured mutation of @xmath71 . 
 in this section , we discuss concrete computation with tilting objects in an @xmath0-cluster tilting category . 
 an exceptional indecomposable object in @xmath9 is uniquely determined by its image @xmath498 $ ] in the grothendieck group @xmath499 . 
 there is a map from @xmath500 to @xmath499 which , for @xmath501 , takes @xmath502 $ ] to @xmath503 $ ] . 
 an exceptional indecomposable in @xmath500 can be uniquely specified by its class in @xmath499 together with its degree . 
 the map from @xmath500 to @xmath499 does not descend to @xmath504 . 
 however , if we fix our usual choice of fundamental domain in @xmath500 , then we can identify the indecomposable objects in it as above . 
 let us define the combinatorial data corresponding to a tilting object @xmath41 to be @xmath87 together with @xmath505 , \deg t_i)$ ] for @xmath506 . 
 given the combinatorial data for a tilting object @xmath41 in @xmath504 , it is possible to determine , by a purely combinatorial procedure , the combinatorial data for the tilting object which results from an arbitrary sequence of mutations applied to @xmath41 .    clearly , it suffices to show that , for any @xmath13 , we can determine the class and degree for @xmath507 . 
 if we can do that then , by the coloured mutation procedure , we can determine the coloured quiver for @xmath508 , and by applying this procedure repeatedly , we can calculate the result of an arbitrary sequence of mutations .    since we are given @xmath87 , we know @xmath509 , and we can calculate @xmath510 $ ] . 
 now we have the following lemma :    [ one ] @xmath511=[b_i^{(0)}]-[t^{(0)}_i]$ ] , and @xmath512 or @xmath513 , whichever is consistent with the sign of the class of @xmath511 $ ] , unless this yields a non - projective indecomposable object in degree @xmath0 , or an indecomposable of degree @xmath1 . 
 the proof is immediate from the exchange triangle @xmath514 .    applying this lemma , and supposing that we are not in the case where its procedure fails 
 , we can determine the class and degree @xmath515 . by the coloured mutation procedure 
 , we can also determine the coloured quiver for @xmath516 . 
 we therefore have all the necessary data to apply lemma  [ one ] again . repeatedly applying the lemma 
 , there is some @xmath69 such that we can calculate the class and degree of @xmath507 for @xmath517 , and the procedure described in the lemma fails to calculate @xmath518 . 
 we also have the following lemma :    [ two ] @xmath519=[b_i^{(m)}]-[t^{(0)}_i]$ ] , and @xmath520 or @xmath521 , whichever is consistent with the sign of @xmath519 $ ] , unless this yields an indecomposable in degree @xmath522 . 
 applying this lemma , starting again with @xmath41 , we can obtain the degree and class for @xmath523 . 
 we can then determine the coloured quiver for @xmath524 , and we are now in a position to apply lemma  [ two ] again . the last complement which lemma  [ two ] will successfully determine is @xmath525 . 
 it follows that we can determine the degree and class of any complement to @xmath263 . 
 in this section , we discuss the application of our results to the study of the @xmath0-cluster complex , a simplicial complex defined in @xcite for a finite root system @xmath526 . 
 we shall begin by stating our results for the @xmath0-cluster complex in purely combinatorial language , and then briefly describe how they follow from the representation - theoretic perspective in the rest of the paper . for simplicity , 
 we restrict to the case where @xmath526 is simply laced . 
 number the vertices of the dynkin diagram for @xmath526 from 1 to @xmath48 . 
 the @xmath0-coloured almost positive roots , @xmath527 , consist of @xmath0 copies of the positive roots , numbered @xmath491 to @xmath0 , together with a single copy of the negative simple roots . 
 we refer to an element of the @xmath13-th copy of @xmath528 as having colour @xmath13 , and we write such an element as @xmath529 . 
 since the dynkin diagram for @xmath526 is a tree , it is bipartite ; we fix a bipartition @xmath530 . 
 the @xmath0-cluster complex , @xmath531 , is a simplicial complex on the ground set @xmath527 . 
 its maximal faces are called @xmath0-clusters . 
 the definition of @xmath531 is combinatorial ; we refer the reader to @xcite . 
 the @xmath0-clusters each consist of @xmath48 elements of @xmath527 ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.9 ) . 
 every codimension 1 face of @xmath531 is contained in exactly @xmath1 maximal faces ( * ? ? ? 
 * proposition 2.10 ) . 
 there is a certain combinatorially - defined bijection @xmath532 , which takes faces of @xmath531 to faces of @xmath531 ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem 2.4 ) 
 .    it will be convenient to consider _ ordered @xmath0-clusters_. an ordered @xmath0-cluster is just a @xmath48-tuple from @xmath527 , the set of whose elements forms an @xmath0-cluster . 
 write @xmath533 for the set of ordered @xmath0-clusters .    for each ordered @xmath0-cluster @xmath534 
 , we will define a coloured quiver @xmath535 . 
 we will also define an operation @xmath536 , which takes ordered @xmath0-clusters to ordered @xmath0-clusters , changing only the @xmath70-th element . 
 we will define both operations inductively . 
 the set @xmath537 of negative simple roots forms an @xmath0-cluster . 
 its associated quiver is defined by drawing , for each edge @xmath538 in the dynkin diagram , a pair of arrows . 
 suppose @xmath539 and @xmath540 . 
 then we draw an arrow from @xmath13 to @xmath70 with colour @xmath541 , and an arrow from @xmath70 to @xmath13 with colour @xmath0 . 
 suppose now that we have some ordered @xmath0-cluster @xmath542 , together with its quiver @xmath535 . 
 we will now proceed to define @xmath543 . write @xmath544 for the number of arrows in @xmath535 of colour @xmath541 from @xmath70 to @xmath69 . 
 define :    @xmath545    let @xmath79 be the colour of @xmath546 . 
 we define @xmath543 by replacing @xmath546 by some other element of @xmath527 , according to the following rules :    * if @xmath546 is positive and @xmath236 is positive , replace @xmath546 by @xmath547 . * 
 if @xmath546 is positive and @xmath236 is negative , replace @xmath546 by @xmath548 . * 
 if @xmath546 is negative simple @xmath549 , define @xmath550 by @xmath551 , and then replace @xmath546 by @xmath552 , with colour zero . 
 define the quiver for the @xmath0-cluster @xmath543 by the coloured quiver mutation rule from section 2 . 
 since any @xmath0-cluster can be obtained from @xmath537 by a sequence of mutations , the above suffices to define @xmath543 and @xmath535 for any ordered @xmath0-cluster @xmath542 . 
 the operation @xmath553 defined above takes @xmath0-clusters to @xmath0-clusters , and the @xmath0-clusters @xmath554 for @xmath555 are exactly those containing all the @xmath556 for @xmath557 . 
 the connection between the combinatorics discussed here and the representation theory in the rest of the paper is as follows . 
 @xmath527 corresponds to the indecomposable objects of ( a fundamental domain for ) @xmath36 . 
 the cluster tilting objects in @xmath36 correspond to the @xmath0-clusters . 
 the operation @xmath558 corresponds to @xmath25 $ ] . for further details on the translation , 
 the reader is referred to @xcite . 
 the above proposition then follows from the approach taken in section [ sec : cc ] . 
 here we give an alternative description of coloured quiver mutation at vertex @xmath70 .    1 .   for each pair of arrows @xmath559 & j\ar^{(0)}[r ] & k } \ ] ] with @xmath560 , the arrow from @xmath13 to @xmath70 of arbitrary colour @xmath79 , and the arrow from @xmath70 to @xmath69 of colour @xmath541 , add a pair of arrows : an arrow from @xmath13 to @xmath69 of colour @xmath79 , and one from @xmath69 to @xmath13 of colour @xmath561 . 
 2 .   if the graph violates property ii , because for some pair of vertices @xmath13 and @xmath69 there are arrows from @xmath13 to @xmath69 which have two different colours , cancel the same number of arrows of each colour , until property ii is satisfied . 
 3 .   add one to the colour of any arrow going into @xmath70 and subtract one from the colour of any arrow going out of @xmath70 . 
 the above algorithm is well - defined and correctly calculates coloured quiver mutation as previously defined . 
 fix a quiver @xmath71 and a vertex @xmath70 at which the mutation is being carried out .    to prove that the algorithm is well - defined 
 , we must show that at step 2 , there are only two colours of arrows running from @xmath13 to @xmath69 for any pair of vertices @xmath13 , @xmath69 . 
 ( otherwise there would be more than one way to carry out the cancellation procedure of step 2 . )    since in the original quiver @xmath71 , there was only one colour of arrows from @xmath13 to @xmath69 , in order for this problem to arise , we must have added two different colours of arrows from @xmath13 to @xmath69 at step 1 . 
 two colours of arrows will only be added from @xmath13 to @xmath69 if , in @xmath71 , there are both @xmath93-coloured arrows from @xmath70 to @xmath69 and from @xmath70 to @xmath13 . in this case , by property iii , there are @xmath562-coloured arrows from @xmath13 to @xmath70 and from @xmath69 to @xmath70 . 
 it follows that in step 1 , we will add both @xmath93-coloured and @xmath562-coloured arrows . applying proposition 5.1 , we see that any arrows from @xmath13 to @xmath69 in @xmath71 are of colour 0 or @xmath0 . thus , as desired , after step 1 , there are only two colours of arrows in the quiver , so step 2 is well - defined . 
 we now prove correctness . 
 let @xmath563 . 
 write @xmath76 for the number of @xmath79-coloured arrows from @xmath13 to @xmath70 in @xmath71 , and similarly @xmath564 for @xmath565 . 
 write @xmath566 and @xmath567 for the result of applying the above algorithm . 
 it is clear that only the final step of the algorithm is relevant for @xmath568 where one of @xmath13 or @xmath69 coincides with @xmath70 , and therefore that in this case @xmath569 as desired . 
 suppose now that neither @xmath13 nor @xmath69 coincides with @xmath70 . 
 suppose further that in @xmath71 there are no @xmath93-coloured arrows from either @xmath13 or @xmath69 to @xmath70 , and therefore also no @xmath0-coloured arrows from @xmath69 to @xmath13 or @xmath70 . 
 in this case , @xmath570 . in the algorithm , no arrows will be added between @xmath13 and @xmath69 in step 1 , and therefore no further changes will be made in step 2 . 
 thus @xmath571 , as desired . 
 suppose now that there are @xmath93-coloured arrows from @xmath70 to both @xmath13 and @xmath69 . in this case , 
 @xmath572 . in this case , as discussed in the proof of well - definedness , an equal number of @xmath93-coloured and @xmath562-coloured arrows will be introduced at step 1 . 
 they will therefore be cancelled at step 2 . 
 thus @xmath573 as desired . 
 suppose now that there is a @xmath93-coloured arrow from @xmath70 to @xmath69 , but not from @xmath70 to @xmath13 . 
 let the arrows from @xmath13 to @xmath70 , if any , be of colour @xmath79 . 
 at step 1 of the algorithm , we will add @xmath574 arrows of colour @xmath79 to @xmath71 . by proposition 5.1 , 
 the arrows in @xmath71 from @xmath13 to @xmath69 are of colour @xmath79 or @xmath575 . 
 one verifies that the algorithm yields the same result as coloured quiver mutation , in the three cases that the arrows from @xmath13 to @xmath69 in @xmath71 are of colour @xmath79 , that they are of colour @xmath575 but there are fewer than @xmath574 , and that they are of colour @xmath575 and there are at least as many as @xmath574 .    the final case , that there is a @xmath93-coloured arrow from @xmath70 to @xmath13 but not from @xmath70 to @xmath69 , is similar to the previous one . 
 in @xcite , a certain category @xmath576 is constructed , which is shown to be equivalent to the @xmath0-cluster category of dynkin type @xmath2 . 
 the description of @xmath576 is as follows . 
 take an @xmath577-gon @xmath578 , with vertices labelled clockwise from 1 to @xmath577 . 
 consider the set @xmath39 of diagonals @xmath550 of @xmath578 with the property that @xmath550 divides @xmath578 into two polygons each having a number of sides congruent to 2 modulo @xmath0 . for each @xmath579 , there is an object @xmath580 in @xmath576 . 
 these objects @xmath580 form the indecomposables of the additive category @xmath576 . 
 we shall not recall the exact definition of the morphisms , other than to note that they are generated by the morphisms @xmath581 which exist provided that @xmath538 and @xmath582 are both diagonals in @xmath39 , and that , starting at @xmath70 and moving clockwise around @xmath578 , one reaches @xmath69 before @xmath13 . 
 a collection of diagonals in @xmath39 is called non - crossing if its elements intersect pairwise only on the boundary of the polygon 
 . an inclusion - maximal such collection of diagonals divides @xmath578 into @xmath583-gons ; we therefore refer to such a collection of diagonals as an @xmath583-angulation . 
 if we remove one diagonal @xmath550 from an @xmath583-angulation @xmath584 , then the two @xmath583-gons on either side of @xmath550 become a single @xmath585-gon . 
 we say that @xmath550 is a _ diameter _ of this @xmath585-gon , since it connects vertices which are diametrically opposite ( with respect to the @xmath585-gon ) . 
 if @xmath586 is another diameter of this @xmath585-gon , then @xmath587 is another maximal noncrossing collection of diagonals from @xmath39 .

18,"this paper explores the phenomenology of the standard model s minimal supersymmetric @xcite extension with a continuous @xmath1 symmetry ( hereafter called the ` mr model')@xcite . 
 this model of low - energy supersymmetry has a much smaller - dimensional parameter space than the minimal supersymmetric model with a discrete @xmath3-parity ( mssm @xcite ) . as a result , it has two attractive features . 
 first , the mr model makes specific predictions of the values of a number of observables , such as the gaugino masses . 
 in addition , the mr model is free of the superpotential term @xmath4 and the soft supersymmetry breaking terms @xmath5 that cause well - known theoretical difficulties in the mssm . 
 we focus , in particular on the recent measurements of @xmath2 @xmath6 which yield a value @xmath7 @xcite that differs markedly from the one - loop standard model prediction @xmath8 @xcite . 
 the oblique and qcd corrections to the @xmath9-quark and hadronic decay widths of the @xmath10 each largely cancel when the ratio is formed , making @xmath2 very sensitive to direct corrections to the @xmath11 vertex  especially those involving the heavy top quark . 
 our work complements some recent papers on susy models with discrete r - parity . 
 the implications of the @xmath2 measurement for the mssm are discussed in refs . 
 @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . 
 a region of the mssm parameter space that has some phenomenology similar to that of the mr model is studied in @xcite . 
 the following section describes the mr model in more detail . 
 we then compute the vertex corrections to @xmath2 in the mr model and find that the result is within @xmath12 of the experimental value so long as the lighter top squark is light enough ( and the charged higgs boson is heavy enough ) . 
 section 4 discusses additional constraints that place a lower bound on the mass of the lighter top squark . 
 the information that future experiments may yield is studied in section 5 ; ongoing and upcoming experiments at fnal and lep should be capable of confirming or excluding the mr model . 
 the last section briefly summarizes our findings . 
 the model explored in this paper is the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model in which @xmath3-parity is extended to a continuous @xmath13 symmetry . 
 the continuous @xmath3-symmetry is defined by assigning @xmath3 charges + 1 to the superspace coordinate @xmath14 , + 1 to matter superfields and 0 to higgs superfields . in terms of component fields , 
 all ordinary particles carry zero @xmath3 charge while their superpartners have non - zero @xmath3-charge . 
 the most general @xmath1-symmetric lagrangian is described by the superpotential @xmath15 where each term has @xmath16 , and the quark and lepton superfields @xmath17 @xmath18 have the usual @xmath19 gauge interactions . 
 note the absence of a @xmath4 term which would violate the @xmath1 symmetry . 
 the most general symmetry forbids majorana gaugino masses , the model contains an additional color octet chiral superfield to give a dirac mass to the gluino . 
 this field appears only in the soft supersymmetry breaking potential . 
 the gluino mass is relevant to this work in that it renders the 1-loop correction to @xmath2 from diagrams with internal gluinos and bottom squarks negligible compared to the effects of the diagrams considered here . 
 we will therefore not mention the color octet superfield further . 
 the effects of allowing the gluino to be extremely light in a @xmath1-symmetric model will be considered in future work . ] 
 soft supersymmetry breaking potential consistent with our symmetries and a gim - like mechanism to naturally suppress flavor - changing neutral currents is : @xmath20 where we neglect small yukawa - suppressed corrections to the superpartners masses . 
 note the characteristic absence of gaugino mass terms ( @xmath21 ) and trilinear scalar terms ( @xmath22 ) . for a more detailed description of the model 
 we refer the reader to  @xcite . 
 the non - standard one - loop corrections to @xmath2 considered in this paper are of two kinds . 
 one involves the charged - higgs / top / bottom vertex ; the other , the chargino / stop / bottom vertex . 
 they therefore involve the following parameters : charged higgs mass @xmath23 , chargino masses @xmath24 , stop mass eigenvalues @xmath25 , stop mixing angle @xmath26 , and ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath27 . in the remainder of this section , we focus on those aspects of the model that are directly relevant to determining the above parameters . 
 first we should discuss masses . 
 the charged higgs mass is given in terms of the @xmath28 mass as @xmath29 which implies that @xmath30 is heavier than @xmath31 . 
 the charginos masses are @xmath32 @xmath33 we will soon find that in this model the charginos are nearly degenerate with the @xmath31 bosons . as it is relevant to the limits we will ultimately set on the top squark masses , we also note that at the one - loop level , the light neutral higgs boson has a mass of of the @xmath34 term in the superpotential and the coefficient @xmath35 of the trilinear scalar operators in the supersymmetry breaking terms . 
 those two coefficients vanish in the mr model because of the continuous @xmath1 symmetry . ] 
 @xmath36 in the limit that @xmath37 , which allows bottom squark contributions to be neglected ; the reason this limit is preferred will become clear shortly . 
 the values of the top squark masses are intimately connected to the physics of the lightest superpartner ( the photino ) . 
 the photino is massless at tree level but , together with its dirac partner @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 in the notation of @xcite , acquires a dirac mass at one loop that is generated by the exchange of left- and right - handed top squarks@xcite @xmath40  from the cosmological point of view , the present mass density is bounded from above by @xmath41 . 
 this implies a lower bound on the cross section for photino annihilation , @xmath42 . 
 since @xmath42 grows as the square of the photino mass , the result is a lee - weinberg  @xcite type of lower bound on the photino mass @xmath43^{-1 } ( \omega_{\tilde{\gamma}}h^2)^{-1}\ ] ] where @xmath44 runs over all squarks and sleptons of charge @xmath45 and mass @xmath46 such that the corresponding quarks and leptons are the possible final states of photino annihilation @xcite . 
 since the photino can not be massless , equation ( [ photstop ] ) implies that the top squarks @xmath47 and @xmath48 can not be degenerate in the mr model . 
 if one supposes @xmath48 to be lighter than @xmath47 , then , for a given mass of @xmath48 , one will find a lower bound on the mass of @xmath47 . 
 for example , if @xmath49 gev , then @xmath50 gev . 
 the top squark mass eigenstates @xmath51 and @xmath52 are related to @xmath48 and @xmath47 by @xmath53 which defines the mixing angle @xmath26 . 
 we find that in order for the stop mass eigenvalues @xmath54,@xmath55 to be real , the stop mixing angle @xmath26 must be less than 10 degrees . 
 thus , in the mr model , @xmath56 .    finally , we need to discuss @xmath57 . 
 we have already seen that the overall scale of @xmath58 is of the order of 1 gev . 
 this makes the decay @xmath59 possible , which in turn makes the @xmath10 invisible width larger than it is in the standard model . 
 the branching fraction of @xmath60 is suppressed by a factor of @xmath61 relative to the standard model branching fraction for one @xmath62 species , @xmath63 . 
 thus we have @xmath64 the experimental limit on the number of light neutrino species  @xcite , @xmath65 , therefore implies that at 95% c.l . 
 @xmath27 lies very close which naturally appears in gut - inspired models with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking . ] to unity : @xmath66    the several parameters of the mr model are now essentially reduced to two . 
 the stringent constraint @xmath67 forces the charginos to be approximately degenerate with the @xmath31 . 
 the requirement that the photino not be massless forces the top squark mixing angle to be less than @xmath68 ; we take @xmath69 throughout our calculations . when @xmath69 , the superpartner of the right - handed top quark , @xmath48 is identical to the light top squark mass eigenstate @xmath51 ; since only @xmath48 enters the loop affecting the @xmath10 coupling to left - handed @xmath9 quarks , @xmath2 depends on @xmath54 but not @xmath55 . 
 we are left with only two parameters on which @xmath2 will depend : @xmath23 and @xmath54 . 
 in order to test the mr model , we can separate contributions to @xmath2 into those occurring in both the standard and mr models and those additional effects present only in the mr model . in the notation of refs . 
 @xcite , @xmath70\\ \nonumber \\ { \nabla_b^{mr } } \equiv { \nabla_b}^{mr}(m_t ) -{\nabla_b}^{mr}(0)\nonumber \label{citr}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the one - loop level standard model prediction using a top quark mass of @xmath72 gev , @xmath73 is the standard model prediction assuming a massless top quark  @xcite , and @xmath74 is the sum of the one - loop interference with the tree graph divided by the squared amplitude of the tree graph . in the mr model , 
 there are two relevant types of non - standard one - loop vertex diagrams : those with internal charged - higgses and top quarks , and those with internal charginos and top squarks . 
 their contributions to @xmath74 are proportional to @xmath75 ; the details of the calculation are presented in the appendix . 
 another type of vertex diagram with internal neutralinos and bottom squarks makes contributions proportional to @xmath76 , which is negligible in the mr model because @xmath77 ; we omit these . 
 -.5 in    -2em    -2em    in figure 1 , we plot @xmath78 , the contribution from the @xmath79  t vertex diagrams to @xmath80 , as a function of @xmath81 , when @xmath27 is taken to be 1 , 0.9 or 1.1 . 
 the overall sign is negative and the value of @xmath82 shifts by @xmath83 as @xmath27 varies from 1 to 1.1 or 0.9 . 
 figure 2 shows the corresponding contribution from @xmath84  @xmath85 loops to @xmath86 , as a function of the light top squark mass @xmath54 when the mixing angle @xmath26 between top squarks is @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) . 
 the result is positive , and the deviation due to a 10@xmath89 shift in @xmath27 is negligible . 
 thus the net shift in @xmath2 is due to a balance between the oppositely - signed contributions from the two types of loop diagrams . in figure 3 
 , we set @xmath90 gev and plot @xmath2 as a function of @xmath23 for a range of @xmath27 ; we can clearly infer a lower bound on the allowed value of @xmath23 at fixed @xmath54 . 
 likewise , figure 4 shows the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath54 for @xmath91 gev ; we can infer an upper bound on @xmath54 for fixed @xmath23 . in subsequent diagrams we plot results only for @xmath92 and 
 keep in mind that an increase of 10% in @xmath57 corresponds to an increase of about 0.1% in @xmath2 for given @xmath23 and @xmath54 .    -2em 
 -2em    figure 5 shows how the experimental 95% c.l . 
 lower bound on @xmath2 separates the @xmath23 vs. @xmath54 parameter space into allowed and disallowed regions . 
 recall that the @xmath93 loop gives negative corrections to @xmath2 , while the @xmath94 loop gives positive corrections . since the standard model prediction for @xmath2 lies well below the experimental lower bound , 
 some positive contribution is required to bring the mr prediction for @xmath2 into agreement with experiment . 
 hence , by taking the charged higgs mass to infinity , one finds an asymptotic upper limit on the light stop mass of 180 gev at 95% c.l . 
 the precise upper bound on @xmath54 will be smaller than 180 gev for any finite @xmath23 , due to the negative contribution to @xmath2 from the @xmath93 loop . 
 for any fixed @xmath23 , the corresponding upper bound on @xmath54 can be read from figure 5 .    -1.5em 
 combining the information gleaned from @xmath2 with other experimental data yields additional constraints on the mr model . 
 first , we can use the lower bounds on the mass of the light neutral higgs ( @xmath95 ) boson to set a limit on @xmath55 . recall that the @xmath95 mass depends on the product of the top squark masses at the one - loop level . 
 thus for a given light top squark mass , the heavier the heavy stop , the heavier the neutral higgs . then by setting the light top squark s mass to the maximum value of 180 gev and using the lower bound of 56 gev coupling lies between the extremes of the other two models . 
 the @xmath96 coupling is proportional to @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the mixing angle that diagonalizes the neutral higgs mass matrix . throughout the parameter space of the mr model 
 , @xmath99 is greater than about 0.75 ; it can take on smaller values in the mssm and is 1.0 in the standard model . ] that aleph @xcite sets on the @xmath95 mass in the mr model , we find that @xmath100 tev . 
 if the mass of the @xmath51 is less than 180 gev , the lower bound on @xmath55 increases accordingly . 
 -.25 in    -0.5em    the information on the masses of the top squarks provides limits on the photino mass , which depends on the masses of both top squarks at the one - loop level . to maintain naturalness 
 , the masses of the sparticles should be of the order of a tev . 
 if the mass of the heavy stop lies between 0.7 and 10 tev , the photino mass is between 2.5 and 10 gev . 
 this is very helpful because both d0 @xcite and the lep collaborations have set limits on the allowed region of the @xmath101 vs.@xmath54 plane . for the narrow range of photino masses allowed in the mr model , these experiments essentially constrain the light stop mass to take values only in the ranges : ( 0  12 gev ) , ( 44 gev  46 gev ) , and ( 88 gev  180 gev ) . 
 this is shown in figure 6 . 
 a closer look then excludes the case @xmath102 gev . 
 if the @xmath51 is this light , then in order for the @xmath95 mass to exceed the lep lower bound of 56 gev , the heavy stop would have to be heavier than about 24 tev . as a result , 
 the stop mixing angle would be almost precisely zero . 
 the combination of such a light @xmath51 and such a small mixing angle has already been ruled out by opal  @xcite . 
 the mass of the @xmath51 in the mr model must therefore lie in one of the upper two allowed ranges . 
 in fact , preliminary results from the l3 collaboration based on the recent lep run at a center - of - mass energy of 130  140 gev show no signs of a top squark in the mass range below about 50 gev@xcite . 
 it is therefore likely that the middle mass range for @xmath51 in the mr model is also excluded . 
 we now briefly discuss several measurements that may provide useful information on the mr model in the future . 
 these run the gamut from precision measurements to searches for new particles . 
 since a light top squark could have an appreciable effect on the branching ratio for @xmath103 , we compare the ratio measured at cleo with that predicted by the mr model . 
 the branching ratio of @xmath104 measured in cleo  @xcite is @xmath105 the mr model predicts a branching ratio within @xmath12 of the cleo result whenever the light stop weighs in the regions of ( 44 gev  46 gev ) and ( 88 gev  180 gev ) . 
 until future experiments reduce the errors on the @xmath106 branching ratio , this particular quantity will not help constrain the mr model . 
 the relatively light mass of the @xmath51 in the mr model makes it possible for the top quark to decay to a top squark and a neutralino . as a result 
 , the branching ratio for the standard top quark decay mode @xmath107 , which is approximately 100% in the standard model , would be only 70 
 80% in the mr model . 
 the limits on this branching ratio from cdf data @xcite are not strong enough to constrain the mr model  yet . 
 once all of the 1994  5 data from lep are analyzed , the precise experimental limits on @xmath2 may shift . 
 the potential consequences for the mr model are quite interesting . 
 figure 7 shows contours corresponding to several values of @xmath2 near the current experimental @xmath12 lower bound . 
 these curves imply that while the value of @xmath2 in the mr model is consistent with the present experimental value of @xmath2 , the theoretical prediction generally lies well below the experimental central value of 0.2205 @xcite .    as a result 
 , the size of the allowed parameter space of the mr model depends sensitively on the experimental determination of @xmath2 . 
 clearly even a very small downward shift in the central value of @xmath2 would allow @xmath54 to be heavier than 180 gev . 
 on the other hand , an upward shift in the central value or an improvement in the errors on the current central value of @xmath2 could reduce the upper bound on @xmath54 to a value below 88 gev 
 i.e. into the region already excluded by d0 and lep . 
 -.5 in    -0.5em    searches for top squarks in the d0 and cdf experiments should explore the remaining parameter space of the mr model . 
 for example , the mass range @xmath108 gev can be probed by seeking top squarks in the decay channels @xmath109 , in addition to the @xmath110 channel already explored by d0 . 
 the upcoming experiments at lep ii will also be sensitive to part of the allowed mass range for light top squarks . 
 in addition , combining our upper bound on @xmath54 and the ` naturalness ' upper bound on @xmath55 with equation ( 7 ) implies an upper bound of @xmath111 90 gev on @xmath112 . 
 searches for @xmath113 are discussed in ref . 
 by considering the value of @xmath2 predicted by minimal @xmath1 symmetric supersymmetry , we have shown that this model is consistent with experiment so long as the light top squark weighs no more than 180 gev . 
 other considerations , including top squark searches at lep and d0 , further restrict the top squark mass to satisfy @xmath114 gev . 
 the light top squark of the mr model should therefore be accessible to d0 , cdf and the lep ii experiments .

19,"the classical method of adding two integers of @xmath1-bits takes @xmath2 bit operations but the classical method of multiplying them takes @xmath3 bit operations . 
 complexity of addition is optimal in number of bit operations , whereas optimal multiplication algorithm for integers is an open problem . 
 the classical approach to multiply two @xmath1-bit integers requires @xmath3 bit operations . 
 karatsuba multiplication [ 9 ] uses divide - and - conquer technique to multiply two @xmath1-bit integers in @xmath4 bit operations(logarithms are to the base 2 unless otherwise specified ) by replacing some of the multiplication by less costly addition and subtraction . 
 toom - cook algorithm further improves the above bound [ 3 ] . 
 toom - cook method is the generalization of karatsuba method which split each number to be multiplied in multiple parts [ 12 ] . given two large integers , toom - cook splits up multiplicand and multiplier into @xmath5 smaller parts each of length @xmath6 , and performs operations on the parts . 
 as @xmath5 grows , one may combine many of the multiplication sub - operations , thus reducing the overall complexity of the algorithm . for @xmath7 toom - cook 
 reduces 9 multiplication to 5 , with asymptotic complexity of @xmath8 . 
 schonhage - strassen integer multiplication algorithm [ 10 ] uses fast fourier transform ( fft ) by selecting the principal roots of unity as evaluation point to perform multiplication in @xmath9 bit operations . 
 fft method employs a divide - and - conquer strategy by taking advantage of the special properties of the complex root of unity to perform multiplication of two polynomials in only @xmath10 arithmetic complexity [ 4 ] . 
 in fact many multiplication algorithms can viewed as schemes for the evaluation of polynomials then multiplication of their values and followed by interpolation . 
 currently , the asymptotically fastest algorithm for multiplication of two @xmath1-bit integers is by furer [ 7 ] which runs in @xmath11 . where @xmath12 is iterated logarithm function [ 5 ] defined as : @xmath13 furer algorithm uses arithmetic over complex number . 
 same asymptotic bound can also be achieved using modular arithmetic [ 6 ] . 
 + the schonhage - strassen algorithm and furer algorithm are asymptotically fast but they are suited for extremely large numbers . 
 furer algorithm although asymptotically fastest , only achieves an advantage for astronomically large values and as such it is currently not used in practice . 
 the crossover points between these algorithms are usually very high when the algorithms are implemented [ 8 ] . for small inputs 
 even karatsuba algorithm runs slower than the classical multiplication algorithm because of recursion overhead . in this paper 
 we use nikhilam sutra or method from vedic mathematics [ 11 ] to perform efficient multiplication for small inputs . 
 nikhilam sutra performs large multiplication by converting it to small multiplication along with some addition and shifting operations . + 
 this paper is organized as follows . 
 section 2 describes background and motivation . 
 section 3 presents our proposed work , the multiplication algorithm and its features . in section 4 
 , we present some applications . 
 finally , section 5 contains conclusion . 
 the simplest method to multiply two @xmath1-digit integers is using classical or long multiplication method which requires @xmath3 multiplication operations . 
 whereas to add or subtract two @xmath1-digit integers using traditional method requires at most @xmath1 number of addition or subtraction which is optimal in terms of number of addition / subtraction operation performed . to improve the @xmath3 bound of multiplication 
 , several algorithms have been discovered . 
 the simplest one is karatsuba algorithm which is based on divide - and - conquer paradigm [ 1 ] . 
 karatsuba algorithm is based on the fact that two - digit multiplication can be done with only three instead of four multiplications required by standard method . 
 suppose we want to multiply two @xmath14-digit decimal numbers 
 @xmath15 :    1 .   compute @xmath16 2 . 
 compute @xmath17 3 . 
 compute @xmath18 4 . 
 compute @xmath19 , here @xmath20 is equal to @xmath21 5 . 
 result @xmath22    for large number of digits we can apply this method recursively by splitting the multiplicand and multiplier in two parts . the complexity of this method is @xmath23 . since multiplication operation is costly as compared to addition and shift 
 , some constant number of addition and shift operations can be safely ignored . in this paper 
 we assume that multiplicand and multiplier are having equal number of digits . 
 + for example suppose we want to multiply @xmath24 . 
 the standard method of long multiplication requires 4 one - digit multiplication along with some addition and shift . using karatsuba algorithm 
 we can compute it as follows :    1 .   compute @xmath25 2 . 
 compute @xmath26 3 . 
 compute @xmath27 ; @xmath28 4 . 
 compute @xmath29 5 . 
 result @xmath30    a schematic view of above multiplication is shown in fig . 
 the three multiplication operations are enclosed in ellipse . 
 in fact the total number of @xmath31-digit multiplication required in above example is 5 . note that to compute @xmath32 in step @xmath33 requires , three @xmath31-digit multiplication by applying this method one s more . 
 using karatsuba method , width=264,height=151 ]    nikhilam sutra is one of the 16 sutras of vedic mathematics [ 11 ] . 
 it can be used to convert large - digits multiplication to small - digits multiplication with the help of few extra add , subtract and shift operations . in some cases 
 two - digit multiplication can be performed using only @xmath31 one - digit multiplication instead of @xmath33 one - digit multiplication as required by karatsuba algorithm . 
 suppose we have to perform same multiplication @xmath24 using this method . 
 we can use the nikhilam sutra as follows :    1 .   compute @xmath34 ; subtract the multiplicand from nearest base 2 . 
 compute @xmath35 ; subtract the multiplier from the same base 3 . 
 compute @xmath36 4 . 
 compute @xmath37 5 . 
 result @xmath38    in the fig . 
 2 , we can see that there is only one multiplication operation involved .     using nikhilam method , width=264,height=151 ]    above multiplication is also shown in table 1 . in this multiplication 
 we have used @xmath31 multiplication , @xmath31 addition , @xmath33 subtraction and @xmath31 shift operation . 
 this particular multiplication is more efficient than both standard multiplication and karatsuba method . 
 suppose multiplicand is @xmath39 and multiplier is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is nearest base . 
 we have : @xmath42 the general scheme of multiplication @xmath43 is shown in table 2 . 
 .multiplication of @xmath44 [ cols=""^,^,^ "" , ]     correctness of the nikhilamsquaring can be easily established using induction on the bit length of the input @xmath45 . 
 note that in each column of table 8 , the partial result is , in fact multiplication of corresponding multiplicand and multiplier in that column . + 
 * theorem 1 . * _ nikhilamsquaring algorithm computes square of the input @xmath45 . _ + * proof * : we prove this using induction on the bit length @xmath1 of @xmath45 . for @xmath46 , 
 number @xmath45 has only one bit and @xmath47 when @xmath45 is @xmath31 and @xmath48 when @xmath45 is @xmath49 . 
 therefore it works for @xmath46 . 
 assume it is true for @xmath50 . 
 now we show it for @xmath5 . 
 assume @xmath51 , therefore @xmath52 . 
 + case 1 : if @xmath5th bit is @xmath31 then @xmath53 , and the processing of @xmath5th step is @xmath54 also we have @xmath55 and therefore @xmath56 @xmath57 and hence @xmath58 , and the statement of theorem follows . 
 + case 2 : if @xmath5th bit is @xmath49 , then the statement is trivial and @xmath59 , and theorem is proved . 
 + nikhilammultiplication is described in algorithm 2 . 
 it takes two binary numbers @xmath45 and @xmath60 as input and compute their multiplication@xmath61 as output . 
 it performs two calls to nikhilamsquaring algorithm and using that , outputs the desired result . 
 nikhilammultiplication uses only @xmath31 multiplication , @xmath31 division and @xmath62 add / subtract and shift operations for some constant @xmath63 . to show 
 the correctness of nikhilammultiplication is trivial given the correctness of nikhilamsquaring .

 since , asymptotically fast multiplication algorithms like schonhage - strassen and furer algorithms are only useful for extremely large numbers , for small to medium size numbers we can apply nikhilam multiplication . 
 we can use nikhilam multiplication even in conjunction with some other fast algorithm like karatsuba . if @xmath72 is the threshold between classical multiplication and karatsuba algorithm then up to threshold limit @xmath72 we can use nikhilam multiply and beyond that limit we can use karatsuba multiply . 
 we can write the karatsuba algorithm as given in [ 2 ] , with the only modification that if @xmath73 nikhilammultiplication is called . 
 the corresponding pseudo code is given in algorithm 3 . 
 karatsuba multiplication has relatively small threshold with the classical multiplication . the optimal threshold for karatsuba algorithm can vary from about ten to hundred words . 
 nikhilammultiplication can also be used as a stand alone multiplication algorithm . + further optimization to nikhilammultiplication is also possible . 
 least significant @xmath49 s can be truncated from input numbers , and in the end corresponding modification can be done in single operation . 
 we can process the multiplicand and multiplier for consecutive @xmath49 s to skip some of the steps of the algorithm . 
 the proposed algorithm is particularly efficient because multiplication operation is least involved in it .

 in this paper we have explored the possibility of applying the nikhilam sutra of vedic mathematics to binary number multiplication . 
 we can take advantage of the fact that this sutra can convert large - digit multiplication to corresponding small digit multiplication . 
 nikhilam method is particularly efficient when both multiplicand and multiplier are near to some base ( radix ) power . to take this advantage , 
 we have first performed square operation in nikhilamsquaring and then we have used this to finally compute multiplication . future work can be to extend this method to large - digit multiplication and exploit it s properties to perform fast integer multiplications .","multiplication is one of the most important operation in computer arithmetic . 
 many integer operations such as squaring , division and computing reciprocal require same order of time as multiplication whereas some other operations such as computing gcd and residue operation require at most a factor of @xmath0 time more than multiplication . we propose an integer multiplication algorithm using nikhilam method of vedic mathematics which can be used to multiply two binary numbers efficiently .

20,"it has been known for a long time that the classical two - integral equilibrium theory in axisymmetric geometry is not sufficient to adequately describe the stellar discs of galaxies . in accordance with jeans theorem ( jeans 1915 ) 
 , the phase space distribution function of a stellar system in a steady state depends only on the isolating integrals of the motion ; the binding energy @xmath0 and the vertical component of the angular momentum @xmath1 are isolating integrals in a stationary and axisymmetric system . 
 it is a fundamental property of all two - integral distribution functions @xmath2 that the dispersion of the velocity in the radial direction equals the dispersion in the vertical direction : we know that , for example , the disc of the milky way does not have that property  ( binney & merrifield 1998 ) . 
 illustrations of other shortcomings of a two - integral model in a galactic context can be found in durand , dejonghe & acker  ( 1996 ) . 
 the introduction of a third integral of the motion helps to overcome these constraints : in that case , the velocity dispersions can be different in all the directions . 
 numerical experiments show that a third isolating integral seems to exist for most orbits in realistic galactic potentials  ( ollongren 1962 , innanen & papp 1977 , richstone 1982 ) . 
 this third integral can be taken into account numerically in the models by using extensions of schwarzschild s  ( 1979 ) orbit superposition technique  ( cretton et al . 
 1999 , zhao 1999 , hfner et al . 
 it is also possible to define an analytic third integral specific to particular orbital families  ( de zeeuw , evans & schwarzschild 1996 , evans , hfner & de zeeuw 1997 ) or an approximate global third integral  ( petrou 1983ab , dehnen & gerhard 1993 ) , but we choose to construct models with an exact analytic third integral by using a stckel potential  ( stckel 1890 , de zeeuw 1985 ) . 
 it is not quite obvious to define suitable global distribution functions @xmath3 that depend on three exact analytic integrals and that can somewhat realistically represent our ideas of a real stellar disc . 
 for example , bienaym  ( 1999 ) made three - integral extensions of the two - integral parametric distribution functions described in bienaym & schaud  ( 1997 ) , but these ones were built to model the kinematics of neighbouring stars in the milky way only . 
 dejonghe & laurent  ( 1991 ) also defined the three - integral abel distribution functions , but these ones could not provide very thin discs in the two - integral approximation . 
 robijn & de zeeuw  ( 1996 ) constructed three - integral distribution functions for oblate galaxy models , but they also had problems to recover the two - integral approximation .    in this paper 
 we continue the work of batsleer & dejonghe  ( 1995 ) , who constructed component distribution functions that are two - integral , but that can represent ( very ) thin discs when a judicious linear combination of them is chosen . 
 we use these components as a basis for new component distribution functions that are three - integral , of which the batsleer & dejonghe components are a special case .    in the next section 
 , we outline some fundamentals of two - integral equilibrium systems and we show how to model discs with a finite extent in the vertical direction . in section 3 , we present some general facts about stckel potentials and we present new analytic three - integral distribution functions that can represent stellar discs . 
 an analytical expression for the moments of these distribution functions is calculated in section 4 . in the next section 
 , we discuss their physical properties and show their realistic disc - like character . finally , 
 in section 6 , we show that these distribution functions can be used as basis functions in the modeling of a van der kruit disc . for the conclusions , 
 we refer to section 7 . 
 we denote the gravitational potential in cylindrical coordinates @xmath4 by @xmath5 . the two classical isolating integrals of the motion are the binding energy , @xmath6 , and the @xmath7-component of the angular momentum , @xmath8 . 
 when we use the term orbit , we do not consider the information contained in the phases of the orbital motion : an orbit is thus shorthand for an orbital density . 
 even with this definition , each pair @xmath9 represents a family of orbits ; to uniquely identify one particular orbit , we need the presence of a third effective integral of the motion ( i.e.  we need a triple @xmath10 ) . 
 the axisymmetric nature of the system implies we can focus on the motion in a meridional plane ( i.e.  a plane with constant @xmath11 ) . for a position @xmath12 in the meridional plane , 
 the expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 imply that all families of orbits that visit this position have isolating integrals of the motion @xmath9 that meet the requirement @xmath13 since we know that @xmath14 for given @xmath0 and @xmath1 , this relation restricts possible motion for the corresponding family of orbits to a toroidal volume in configuration space .    in @xmath15-space , eq . 
 ( [ eq : ele ] ) defines the region in which the points correspond to families of orbits passing through @xmath12 . the boundary line ( equality in eq . 
 ( [ eq : ele ] ) ) contains orbits that reach the given position with zero velocity ( [ eq : mv ] ) in the meridional plane . 
 keeping @xmath16 fixed while allowing @xmath17 to vary then gives us a family of such boundary lines , of which we denote the envelope by @xmath18 with the parametric equations  ( batsleer & dejonghe 1995 , eq . 
 4 & 5 ) @xmath19                  l_z^2 & = \displaystyle & - \varpi^3 \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \varpi }                          ( \varpi , z_0 ) . 
 \end{array }          \right.\end{aligned}\ ] ] all points in integral space with @xmath20 represent families of orbits that will pass through @xmath21 at a certain @xmath17 . 
 orbits for which @xmath22 also do reach the height @xmath23 , but can never go any higher . 
 all points in integral space with @xmath24 represent families of orbits that can not reach @xmath25 . 
 @xmath26 is thus the minimal binding energy of an orbit that can not bring a star higher than @xmath23 above the galactic plane .    for every height @xmath27 we find a similar curve @xmath28 , with @xmath29 for every value of @xmath1 . 
 similarly , the envelope for the orbits that can not go higher than @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 , which gives us all circular orbits in the galactic plane . 
 orbits belonging to a disc with a maximum height @xmath23 are thus given by @xmath9 for which @xmath32 ( the shaded area in figure 1 ) . 
 batsleer & dejonghe  ( 1995 ) constructed disc - like component distribution functions with a finite extent in vertical direction by setting them equal to zero for @xmath20 . in order to fully understand the components that we present here , that paper should probably be considered as preparatory reading . 
 [ fig : fig2int ] 
 we will work in _ spheroidal coordinates _ 
 , since these coordinates allow a simple expression for our ( axisymmetric ) stckel potential . spheroidal coordinates are given by @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 the roots for @xmath36 of @xmath37 and @xmath4 cylindrical coordinates . 
 the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 are both constant and smaller than zero . 
 a potential is of _ stckel form _ , if there exists a spheroidal coordinate system @xmath33 , in which the potential can be written as @xmath40 for an arbitrary function @xmath41 , @xmath42 . 
 the function @xmath43 then represents the potential in the @xmath30 plane .    for this kind of potential , 
 the hamilton - jacobi equation is separable in spheroidal coordinates , and therefore the orbits admit three analytic isolating integrals of the motion . 
 the third integral of galactic dynamics has the form @xmath44}\ ] ]    more details can be found in de zeeuw  ( 1985 ) and in dejonghe & de zeeuw   ( 1988 ) . 
 as mentioned before , we intend to create three - integral stellar distribution functions , for the construction of stellar discs : we want to achieve an exponential decline in the mass density for large radii , while we want to introduce a preference for ( almost ) circular orbits . 
 it has been known for some time that two - integral models can describe very thin disc systems , with the restriction that both vertical and radial dispersions are equal  ( jarvis & freeman 1985 ) . 
 so we want to create three - integral distribution functions that can describe very thin discs in the two - integral approximation , unlike the abel distribution functions  ( dejonghe & laurent 1991 ) .    the fricke components  ( fricke 1952 ) @xmath45 favour that part of phase space where stars populate circular orbits , so they could be taken as a starting point 
 however , they can not be used in their basic form to model discs with a finite extent because they populate orbits which can reach arbitrary large heights : therefore , we will take as a starting point the components defined in batsleer & dejonghe  ( 1995 , eq . 19 ) .    in order to make the components depending on the third integral @xmath46 
 , we introduce the factor @xmath47 in which the parameter @xmath48 ( and @xmath49 ) will be responsible for the three - integral character of the components . 
 the coefficients @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath48 can , in the most general case , be functions of @xmath1 . 
 this leads us towards a general three - integral disc component of the form    @xmath53    if @xmath54 the distribution function is identically zero in all other cases . 
 the function @xmath55 is defined as @xmath56    the parameter @xmath57 is the rotation parameter ( the value of @xmath57 influences only the odd moments of @xmath58 , see section 4 ) . if @xmath59 , there is no rotation for the component , and if @xmath60 , @xmath58 represents a _ 
 maximum streaming _ 
 component with no counter - rotating stars . 
 the requested exponential decline in the mass density with large radii is controlled by the parameter @xmath61 ( and to some extent by the parameter @xmath62 , see section 5 ) . 
 the parameter @xmath63 is responsible for the favouring of almost circular orbits , i.e. orbits with a binding energy @xmath0 as close as possible to that of circular orbits in the galactic plane ( see section 5 ) . 
 furthermore , if we want to favour ( almost ) circular orbits , we have to suppose the distribution function to be an increasing function of @xmath0 : this forces @xmath51 to be positive . 
 since a large @xmath46 implies that the orbit can reach a large height above the galactic plane  ( see de zeeuw 1985 for a complete analysis of the orbits in a stckel potential ) , the orbits with small @xmath46 s have to be favoured in order to describe thin discs : this forces @xmath48 to be negative . 
 other constraints ( on @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath48 and @xmath63 ) will be imposed in section 4 , in order to enable the analytical calculations of the moments . 
 the moments of a distribution function @xmath58 at the point @xmath33 of a spheroidal coordinate system are defined as @xmath64 with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 the components of the velocity in the @xmath34 , the @xmath11 and the @xmath35 direction of the spheroidal coordinate system , and @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 integers .    the mass density , the mean velocity and the velocity dispersions of the stellar system represented by @xmath58 can easily be expressed in terms of the moments ( [ defmoments ] ) by @xmath71    to obtain the value of one of these moments , we have to integrate over the volume in velocity - space corresponding to all orbits that pass through the point @xmath33 . 
 since all three integrals of the motion are quadratic in @xmath65 and @xmath67 , if @xmath68 or @xmath70 is an odd integer , the moment @xmath72 is identically zero . 
 if @xmath68 and @xmath70 are even integers , the moment @xmath72 can be written as an integral computed in the integral space . we assume in sections 4.1 and 4.2 that @xmath59 ( in that case , there is no rotation and if @xmath69 is odd , the moment is zero ) and that @xmath69 is an even integer ( the general case will easily be derived from this one in section 4.3 ) . under these assumptions ,    @xmath73    where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are given by @xmath76 -                         \frac{\lambda+\gamma}{2(\lambda+\alpha ) } l_z^2 \\[2 mm ]                    i_3 ^ -(e , l_z^2 ) = ( \nu+\gamma ) [ g(\nu)-e ] -                         \frac{\nu+\gamma}{2(\nu+\alpha ) } l_z^2 .

 the integration surface in the @xmath77-plane is defined by @xmath78                  s_{z_0}(l_z ) \leq e \leq \psi-\frac{l_z^2}{2\varpi^2}\\[2 mm ]                  p + qe + rl_z^2 + s i_3   \geq   0 . 
 \end{array }          \right.\ ] ]    the integration limits for the integral in @xmath79 will be determined in section 4.3 . 
 we want to reduce the triple integral ( 13 ) to a simple one by solving the innermost double integral analytically . 
 the reader not interested in the mathematical details might step directly to section 5 .    for this double integral 
 to be analytically solved , however , we will have to make use of those combinations of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath48 ( see section 4.3 ) for which the integration area is transformed into the triangle bounded by @xmath80 as shown in figure [ fig : integration_areas ] . 
 in this situation , we can express the factor @xmath81 as a linear combination of the other three factors in the integrandum ( corresponding to the bounding lines of the integration surface ) : @xmath82 we impose @xmath63 to be an integer : then the double integral in the @xmath77-plane transforms into a sum of integrals : @xmath83 for each integral in this summation , the integrandum consists of factors whose zero - points define the bounding lines for the integration surface in the @xmath77-plane . 
 these integrals can be solved analytically . 
 we will be in this situation ( for all the points @xmath33 of configuration space , where the moments are calculated ) whenever @xmath84 does intersect the @xmath0-axis for @xmath85 .    in order to solve the integrals analytically 
 , one uses the new integration variables @xmath86 and @xmath87 , defined by ( for a fixed @xmath79 ) @xmath88 the line in the @xmath77-plane @xmath84 becomes @xmath89 , and the root of @xmath90 is @xmath91 ( see figure [ fig : integration_areas ] ) .    to make a more compact notation possible , we first define the auxiliary functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 , as @xmath94 and @xmath95    we then have @xmath96 and @xmath97    solving the integral part of one of the terms in eq.([eq : dedi3sum ] ) for @xmath87 then yields @xmath98^{\delta+i } dy \hspace{.5 cm } \nonumber}\\           \lefteqn{=\frac{(-h(\lambda))^{\delta+i}}{(\lambda-\nu)^{\delta+i+1 } }               b(\frac{n-1}{2}+j+1,\delta+i+1 )               \int_0^{x_{\mathrm { max } } } x^{\eta + \frac{l-1}{2}-i - j }              y_{\mathrm { max}}(x)^{\frac{n-1}{2}+i+j+\delta+1 } dx } \label{eq : dedi3term}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    after solving for @xmath86 ( analogous to what we did for @xmath87 ) , one obtains for the whole summation ( [ eq : dedi3sum ] )    @xmath99    the coefficients @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are calculated by equalizing term by term in equation ( [ eq : summation ] ) @xmath103                  0   =   -t + u + vs \\[2 mm ]                  -\frac{s_{z_0}}{s_0-s_{z_0 } }   =   t(\lambda+\gamma){\left[g(\lambda)-\frac{l_z^2}{2(\lambda+\alpha)}\right]}-u(\nu+\gamma )                   { \left[g(\nu)-\frac{l_z^2}{2(\nu+\alpha)}\right]}+vrl_z^2+vp                 \end{array }          \right.\ ] ]    we find for the coefficients @xmath104    with @xmath105    now we have a one - dimensional numerical integration to perform , like for the abel components  ( dejonghe & laurent 1991 ) . 
 the triple integral ( 13 ) is reduced to a simple one if we judiciously choose the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath48 . 
 the double integral in the @xmath77-plane ( for a fixed @xmath1 ) can be solved analytically whenever @xmath106 does intersect the @xmath0-axis for @xmath85 . 
 it has to be the case for all the @xmath1 relevant in the integration . 
 so if we take @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , the double integral can be solved analytically because @xmath110 intersects the @xmath0-axis for the value @xmath111 . in that case 
 , the double condition ( [ eq : cond ] ) becomes a simple one because the condition @xmath112 is automatically verified when @xmath113 since @xmath114 and @xmath115 . 
 we now have to determine the integration limits of the simple integral in @xmath1 . 
 since conditions ( [ eq : ele ] ) and ( [ eq : cond ] ) imply that @xmath116 the integration limits for the integral in @xmath79 are , in a first time , determined by the intersections of @xmath117 and the line @xmath118 in the @xmath15-plane ( see figure 3 ) . 
 furthermore , in order to have a non - degenerate ( i.e. not empty ) triangle in figure [ fig : integration_areas ] , we must have @xmath119 since the condition @xmath120 is automatically verified when condition ( [ eq : xmax ] ) is verified , the equality in ( [ eq : xmax ] ) fixes the minimal and maximal angular momentum to take into account in the integration . 
 knowing that @xmath121 , the resulting expression for the moment ( with @xmath59 and @xmath69 even ) becomes @xmath122    this integration has to be performed numerically 
 .    in the general case @xmath123 , the expression ( [ eq : final ] ) is still valid for the even moments . 
 when @xmath69 is odd , the integrandum has to be multiplied by a factor @xmath124 : @xmath125    [ fig : intarealz ] 
 in this section , we show the realistic disc - like character of our stellar distribution functions : their mass density has a finite extent in the vertical direction and an exponential decline in the galactic plane , they favour almost circular orbits and their velocity dispersions are different in the vertical and radial direction . by varying the parameters 
 , we can give a wide range of shapes to the components .    in order to illustrate the role of the different parameters , we calculate the moments of many component distribution functions with different values for the parameters . 
 as galactic potential , we use one of the stckel potentials described by famaey & dejonghe  ( 2001 ) , that are extensions of the ones described by batsleer & dejonghe  ( 1994 ) . in the implementation of the theory 
 we choose @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath126 . 
 this parameter was introduced in order to impose a maximum height above the galactic plane for the disc - like component ( figure [ fig : parz0 ] ) : indeed , when @xmath127 , an orbit can not go higher than @xmath16 , and the distribution function ( [ eq:3icomp ] ) is null for @xmath128 . in order to model samples of stars belonging to populations with different characteristic heights above the galactic plane 
 , we can use a set of components with different values for this parameter . 
 the parameter @xmath62 enters eq . 
 ( 10 ) as the exponent of @xmath26 : so , for non - negative values of @xmath62 , the factor where it appears will behave as a declining function of @xmath1 , in the same way as @xmath117 does , showing a steeper decline for larger @xmath62 ( see figure [ fig : a1 ] ) . 
 a large @xmath62 thus results in a distribution function that favours a large fraction of bound orbits . 
 when it is increasing , this parameter helps to produce mass close to the center . 
 when a given exponential decline is requested , @xmath62 will be a function of the other parameters rather than a fixed parameter ( see section 5.3 ) . 
 the parameter @xmath61 occurs as exponent in the distribution function s exponential factor . 
 increasing values of this parameter will contribute to the mass distribution near the center ( figure [ fig : a2 ] ) , like in the @xmath62 case ( but exponentially ) . 
 on the other hand , our potential is approximately keplerian at very large radii : this implies that , in the galactic plane , @xmath129 and that ( batsleer & dejonghe 1995 ) @xmath130    so , at very large radii , @xmath61 is the reciprocal of the component s scale length , if the contribution of the other factors to the mass density does not vary much with respect to @xmath17 ( for very large @xmath17 ) . in practice , it is often desirable to use components for which an exponential decline and a given scale length ( as determined by @xmath61 ) is already built - in between two radii ( say @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) . in such cases , 
 the parameter @xmath62 is adjusted in such a way that it corrects for the non - constant behaviour of the other factors at large radii , making the global contribution of all factors ( except the one in @xmath61 ) constant at @xmath131 and @xmath132 .      for this parameter , there are two distinct cases : @xmath134 and @xmath135 . in the first case , 
 the density is maximum in the center and falls off smoothly . in the latter case , 
 the density is null in the center since @xmath136 for @xmath137 . in order to model real stellar systems , we need components with @xmath134 to have some mass in the center . 
 however , in a real galaxy , the maximum number of stars occurs in the intermediate region where the bulge meets the disc : this justifies the utilization of components with @xmath135 when modelling real stellar systems . 
 we see the maximum density moving away from the center when @xmath133 is rising ( figure [ fig : parb ] ) . 
 we also see on figure ( [ fig : parb ] ) that an increasing @xmath133 will concentrate the mass in a smaller region of configuration space . 
 [ fig : parg ]    for a given @xmath1 , the largest value of the factor @xmath138 is obtained when the binding energy @xmath139 corresponds to the circular orbits in the galactic plane ( see figure 1 ) . 
 so , the parameter @xmath63 is responsible for the favouring of almost circular orbits : a larger @xmath63 implies a larger contribution of almost circular orbits ( figure [ fig : parg ] ) and thus a mass density located closer to the plane . 
 condition ( [ eq : cond ] ) @xmath140 implies that for @xmath141 and a strictly negative @xmath48 , the orbits can not reach the height @xmath23 above the galactic plane . 
 we see on figure ( [ fig : pars ] ) that the height @xmath23 is reached only in the case @xmath142 . furthermore , since a large @xmath46 corresponds to an orbit that can reach a large height , the factor @xmath143 favours orbits that stay low . 
 so , by setting @xmath48 more negative , we confine the orbits closer to the galactic plane . 
 a very important property of our components is the possibility of introducing a certain amount of anisotropy in the stellar disc : if we denote by @xmath144 the dispersion of the velocity in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane , and by @xmath145 the dispersion of the radial velocity in the galactic plane , then any nonzero @xmath48 will produce a ratio @xmath146 less than 1 ( figure [ fig : dispratio ] ) . 
 the ratio is closer to unity in the center than in the outer regions : this indicates the physically realistic character of our components . for @xmath142 , we find @xmath147 since we are dealing with a two - integral component again . 
 a large @xmath49 has partly the same effects as a large @xmath63 : it favours circular orbits . 
 furthermore , a large @xmath49 augments the effects of the negative @xmath48 and forces the stars to stay close to the plane by favouring low @xmath46-values . as we can see on figure ( [ fig : pard ] ) , a component with a larger @xmath49 has more stars in the galactic plane but shows a steeper decline with respect to @xmath7 . 
 the component distribution functions described in this paper are very useful as basis functions in the method described by dejonghe  ( 1989 ) , in order to model any observable quantities ( spatial mass density , velocity dispersions , average radial velocities on a sky grid , ... ) . as an illustration , we present the application of the method to fit a given spatial density @xmath148 ( see batsleer & dejonghe 1995 for a similar application in the two - integral approximation ) . 
 we look for a linear combination of our components @xmath149 that fits @xmath148 , with @xmath150 and @xmath151 the coefficients that are to be determined .    in practice , to find this linear combination we must introduce a grid @xmath152 in configuration space and minimize the quadratic function in @xmath153 : @xmath154 ^ 2 \label{eq : chi2}\ ] ] this minimization , together with the constraint that the distribution function must be positive in phase space , is a problem of quadratic programming ( hereafter qp ) described by dejonghe  ( 1989 ) .    here , we choose to adopt for @xmath155 a spatial density which closely resembles that of a real disc , i.e. a van der kruit law , for which the vertical disribution is a good compromise between an exponential and an isothermal sheet  ( van der kruit 1988 ) . 
 @xmath156 in order to have a zero derivative with respect to @xmath17 on the rotation axis , we adopt a mass density that follows closely the van der kruit law , without a cusp in the center ( see also batsleer & dejonghe  1995 ) :    @xmath157    with @xmath158 and @xmath159 denoting the horizontal and vertical scale factor , respectively . 
 since the moments @xmath160 are dependent on the potential of the galaxy ( including the dark matter ) , we have to choose a potential for the galaxy that contains the stellar disc we want to model . 
 we adopt a stckel potential with three mass components that produces a flat rotation curve and that therefore is a candidate potential for a disc galaxy ( famaey & dejonghe 2001 , see also batsleer & dejonghe 1994 ) . 
 the actual modelling follows the same strategy as followed by batsleer & dejonghe  ( 1995 ) , which we briefly repeat here for easy reference . 
 the first step in the actual modelling consists in the selection of a subset of components out of the ( infinite ) set of possible components . 
 this subset is chosen so that certain features , that we suppose to be present in the stellar disc , such as circular orbits , are included . 
 for example , we expect the mass density corresponding to a component to have an exponential behaviour close to the mass density we want to model . 
 the qp program first minimizes the function ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) for one component @xmath161 and chooses the component of the initial subset that produces the lowest minimum for that function ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) . then the program iterates , selecting and adding at each iteration the component which , together with the components already chosen in a previous run , produces the best fit . 
 once the minimum of the @xmath162-variable does not change significantly any more with the addition of extra components , the program is halted because too low a value for @xmath162 could imply that the qp program starts producing a distribution function featuring unnecessary oscillations .    as an example 
 , we model a modified van der kruit disc with @xmath163kpc and @xmath164kpc . 
 batsleer & dejonghe  ( 1995 ) already showed that a linear combination of two - integral components ( with @xmath142 and @xmath165 ) could fit such a disc , but with @xmath166 . in order to model real anisotropic velocity data in the future 
 , the dependence on the third integral will be needed . 
 we show that , by choosing components with @xmath167 ; @xmath168 ; @xmath169 ; @xmath170 ; @xmath171 ; @xmath172 ; @xmath173 and @xmath59 in the initial subset , a fit with components featuring @xmath174 and @xmath175 can be obtained too ( see figure 12 ) . 
 the fit is obtained for a linear combination of @xmath176 components at @xmath177 configuration space points ( @xmath178 degrees of freedom ) . 
 if we assume relative errors of @xmath179 , we obtain for our minimum @xmath180 , and the probability that a value of @xmath162 larger than @xmath181 should occur by chance is @xmath182  ( abramowitz & stegun 1972 ) , which makes the goodness - of - fit believable  ( press et al . 1986 ) .    by using stckel dynamics to model a galactic disc , 
 we construct a completely explicit and analytic distribution function , with an explicit dependence on the third integral . 
 figure ( 13 ) displays the distribution function obtained by qp in function of @xmath0 , for @xmath183 and for two values of @xmath46 ( @xmath184 and @xmath185 ) . for @xmath184 , the distribution function is non - zero if @xmath186 ( with @xmath187kpc ) ; for @xmath188 , instead , the maximum value of @xmath0 is the one corresponding to infinitesimally thin short axis tubes and is smaller than @xmath189 . 
 we see on figure ( 13 ) that the distribution function is decreasing with increasing @xmath46 ( particularly near @xmath190 ) , and that it has some clumps . 
 these clumps at @xmath185 are not discontinuities since the distribution function is a linear combination of continuous components . 
 many different three - integral distribution functions correspond to a given spatial density , and there is no guarantee that they will yield realistic velocity dispersions . 
 it is a major result of this paper to show that it is possible to find a linear combination of our components yielding realistic velocity dispersions . 
 figure ( 14 ) displays the ratio @xmath146 in the galactic plane : at the radius corresponding to the solar position in the milky way ( @xmath191-@xmath192 kpc ) , the classical value of @xmath193 is obtained . 
 the local maximum in the @xmath146 curve is due to the individual shapes of the velocity dispersions curves ( figure 14 ) . 
 in this paper , we have constructed new analytic three - integral stellar distribution functions yielding @xmath194 : they are generalizations of two - integral ones that can describe thin discs with the restriction that @xmath195  ( batsleer & dejonghe 1995 ) . 
 we first reduced the triple integral defining their moments to a simple one , like in the abel case  ( dejonghe & laurent 1991 ) , by making some assumptions on the parameters . 
 then we looked for the effects of the different parameters and showed the disc - like ( physically realistic ) features of our distribution functions : they have a finite extent in vertical direction and an exponential decline in the galactic plane , while favouring almost circular orbits . 
 a very important feature induced by the dependence on the third integral is their ability to introduce a certain amount of anisotropy , by varying the parameters responsible for this dependence ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) . 
 we finally showed that a van der kruit disc can be modelled by a linear combination of such distribution functions with an explicit dependence on the third integral and a realistic anisotropy in velocity dispersions . 
 this implies that they are very promising tools to model real data with @xmath194 ( hipparcos data for example ) by using the quadratic programming algorithm described by dejonghe  ( 1989 ) . 
 this will provide information on the dynamical state of tracer stars in the milky way ( or on external galaxies ) .

21,"the control and manipulation of single electrons in mesoscopic systems constitutes one of the key ingredients in nanoelectronics . 
 the study of single - electron sources@xcite in the high - frequency regime has attracted a great interest due to their potential application in quantum electron optics experiments , in metrology , and in quantum information processing based on fermionic systems.@xcite in this work we study the time evolution of a quantum dot ( qd ) tunnel coupled to a single electronic reservoir , as depicted schematically in fig .  [ fig_scheme](a ) . in the presence of some time - dependent voltage modulations , 
 this system defines the building block of the typical single - electron source , namely the mesoscopic capacitor.@xcite in the linear - response regime , the relaxation behavior of such a mesoscopic capacitor has been extensively studied theoretically@xcite and experimentally,@xcite revealing the quantization of the charge relaxation resistance.@xcite on the other hand , the application of _ nonlinear _ periodic potentials to the mesoscopic capacitor yields the controlled emission and absorption of electrons at giga - hertz frequencies.@xcite from these experiments the average charge as well as current correlations@xcite after each cycle of the potential applied have been extracted . 
 these results demonstrate the importance of investigating the dynamics of this kind of single - electron sources . in some of the recent realizations@xcite 
 the coulomb interaction is weak ; however , in small - sized qds the coulomb blockade is , in general , strong and it is , therefore , desirable to include it in the theoretical analysis @xcite since it may even dominate time - dependent phenomena , see e.g. ref .  . 
 the time - evolution of interacting quantum dots after the coupling to the leads has been switched on , has , e.g. , been studied in refs .   and references therein .    , coupled to a normal lead with a tunneling strength @xmath0 . 
 dot occupations can be measured via the current passing through a nearby quantum point contact ( qpc ) capacitively coupled to the dot . 
 b ) qd attached to an additional superconducting contact . 
 c ) qd coupled to a ferromagnetic lead . ]    here we investigate the exponential relaxation of a qd towards its equilibrium state after its has been brought out of equilibrium by applying , e.g. , a voltage step pulse . 
 we consider a voltage pulse that affects the occupation of only a single orbital energy level . 
 the level can be spin split due to coulomb interaction . in an earlier work,@xcite some of the present authors investigated the decay of charge and spin of such a single level qd . 
 it was found that the relaxation of charge and spin are given by rates which differ from each other due to coulomb repulsion . since the reduced density matrix of a qd with a single orbital level with spin is four dimensional , there are thus three rates which govern the relaxation of the diagonal elements of the density matrix towards equilibrium ( plus one which is always zero and corresponds to the stable stationary state ) . 
 in addition to the rates that govern charge and spin there is a third rate that appears in the relaxation of a single level qd with spin and with interaction . 
 this additional rate is the subject of this paper . 
 interestingly , this additional time scale is independent of the interaction and of the dot s level position . 
 it is shown to be related to two - particle effects and appears , e.g. , in the time - evolution of the mean squared deviations of the charge from its equilibrium value . 
 we study in detail the perturbations leading to a relaxation of the system with the additional decay rate only , and find that it is indeed related to two - particle correlations . 
 we also propose a procedure to separately read out the different relaxation rates occurring in the dynamics of the qd exploiting the sensitivity of a nearby quantum point contact to the occupation of the qd , see fig . 
 [ fig_scheme ] ( a ) .    in order to further clarify the properties of the additional time scale , we extend our study to two other setups : 
 a qd proximized by an extra , superconducting electrode and tunnel coupled to a normal lead ; and a qd tunnel coupled to a ferromagnetic lead , see fig . 
 [ fig_scheme ] ( b ) and ( c ) . 
 we consider a quantum dot coupled to an electronic reservoir . 
 we assume that the single - particle level spacing in the dot is larger than all other energy scales , so that only one , spin - degenerate level of the qd spectrum is accessible . at a certain time 
 @xmath1 the system is brought out of equilibrium , e.g. by applying a gate potential , and afterwards relaxes to an equilibrium dictated by the hamiltonian @xmath2 . 
 the hamiltonian @xmath3 of the decoupled dot @xmath4 contains the spin - degenerate level @xmath5 and the on - site coulomb energy @xmath6 for double occupation of the dot . 
 the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath7 on the dot is denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the corresponding number operator . 
 the reservoir is modeled by the hamiltonian @xmath10 , in which @xmath11 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath12 and momentum @xmath13 in the lead . 
 the coupling between the dot and the reservoir is described by the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a tunneling amplitude , which we assume to be independent of momentum and spin . by considering a constant density of states @xmath16 in the reservoir , 
 the tunnel coupling strength @xmath0 is defined as @xmath17 .    in the remainder of this paper , we focus on the relaxation behavior of the quantum dot to its equilibrium state and in particular on how this relaxation manifests itself in measurable quantities . 
 we are not interested in the dynamics of the reservoir , thus the trace over its degrees of freedom is performed to obtain the reduced density matrix of the qd . 
 the hilbert space is spanned by the four eigenstates of the decoupled dot hamiltonian , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 represents the unoccupied dot , the dot is in the state @xmath20 when being singly occupied with spin @xmath7 , and @xmath21 is the state of double occupation . 
 the energies related to these states are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where we set the electrochemical potential of the reservoir to zero . 
 as we consider spin - conserving tunneling events , the off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix evolve independently of the diagonal ones ( which are the occupation probabilities ) . 
 we can , therefore , consider these probabilities alone , which arranged in a vector are given by @xmath24 and fulfill the condition @xmath25 . 
 the time evolution of the occupation probabilities is governed by the generalized master equation @xmath26 where the matrix elements @xmath27 of the kernel @xmath28 describe transitions from the state @xmath29 at time @xmath30 to a state @xmath31 at time @xmath32 . 
 we consider now the dynamics of the system after being brought out of equilibrium at time @xmath1 . 
 since for @xmath33 the total hamiltonian is time independent , the transition matrix elements depend only on the time difference @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 . 
 furthermore , we are interested in the exponential decay towards equilibrium . to be more specific , we will therefore consider only the leading , time - independent , prefactor of the exponential functions . 
 time - dependent corrections to the pre - exponential functions , that generally may appear,@xcite are disregarded . 
 furthermore , when focussing on times @xmath32 distant from the switching time @xmath1 , such that the difference @xmath36 is hence much larger than the decay time of the kernel @xmath37 , we can replace the lower limit of the integral in eq . 
 ( [ eq_master ] ) by @xmath38 . expanding the probability vector @xmath39 in eq . 
 ( [ eq_master ] ) around the measuring time @xmath32 we find@xcite @xmath40 here we introduced the laplace transform of the kernel @xmath41 , with @xmath42 and the @xmath43-th derivative of the kernel with respect to the laplace variable @xmath44_{z=0}$ ] . 
 the formal solution of eq . 
 ( [ eq_masterexpand ] ) is given by @xmath45 which depends on the initial probability vector @xmath46 at @xmath47 , where the initial values for the system parameters are given by the ones just after the switching time @xmath1 . 
 the matrix @xmath48 includes markovian and non - markovian processes.@xcite in the following , we consider the limit of weak coupling between quantum dot and reservoir and limit ourselves to a perturbation expansion up to second order in @xmath0 , which is valid for the regime where the tunnel coupling @xmath0 is much smaller than the energy scale set by the temperature @xmath49 . 
 the perturbative expansion of @xmath48 is @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where the number in the superscript represents the power of @xmath0 included in the transition matrix @xmath53 . 
 notice that the first non - markovian correction , i.e. the term @xmath54 is present in second - order in the tunnel coupling . 
 the evaluation of the kernel within a perturbative expansion can be performed using a real - time diagrammatic technique,@xcite which has been used in ref .   in order to extract the exponential decay of spin and charge in the system studied here . 
 considering eq . 
 ( [ eq_exp ] ) , we see that the rates defining the decay of the state into equilibrium are found from the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath48 , which turn out to be real and non - positive . 
 the matrix @xmath48 is not hermitian , as expected since we deal with a dissipative system , and hence has different left and right eigenvectors , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . 
 the time - dependent probability vector , @xmath57 , can be expressed in terms of the right eigenvectors of @xmath48 , each being related to a decay with a different rate . 
 the left eigenvectors determine the observable that decay with a single time scale only , see also the appendix . 
 + in the following we discuss the exponential relaxation towards equilibrium of the vector of occupation probabilities , in first order in the tunneling strength @xmath0 . 
 we start by briefly discussing the simplest case of a single spinless particle . 
 this limit is obtained , when a magnetic field much larger than the temperature is applied , @xmath58 . 
 the hilbert space of the system is two dimensional and spanned by the states @xmath19 and @xmath59 for the empty and singly - occupied dot respectively , whose occupation probabilities are arranged in the vector @xmath60 . 
 the decay to the stationary state is governed by matrix @xmath61 ( defined equivalently to @xmath62 but for the two - dimensional hilbert space for the problem at hand ) which contains a single relaxation rate , namely the tunnel coupling @xmath0 , as intuitively expected . 
 we now include the spin degree of freedom but disregard interactions . 
 the system is described by two independent hilbert spaces spanned by the states @xmath63 and @xmath64 with @xmath7 . 
 the probability vector for each spin @xmath12 can be written in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath61 ( for the two - dimensional hilbert space ) as @xmath65 \label{eq_psigma}\ ] ] where the right eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue zero of @xmath61 defines the occupation probabilities for the equilibrium state , @xmath66 , with the fermi function @xmath67^{-1}$ ] and the inverse temperature @xmath68 . 
 furthermore , @xmath69 is the vector representation of the number operator for dot electrons with spin @xmath12 , whose initial / equilibrium expectation value is obtained by multiplying it from the left into the initial / equilibrium probability vector , @xmath70 . the rate @xmath71 is obtained as the negative of the non - zero eigenvalue of @xmath61 , with the corresponding left eigenvector being @xmath72 . 
 the time evolution of the occupation of each spin state is governed by a single decay rate @xmath0 , @xmath73 this equation can be obtained making use of the fact that the time evolution of the expectation value of any operator , which describes an observable of the qd , is given by projecting its vector representation from the left onto eq . 
 ( [ eq_psigma ] ) . 
 the time evolution of the total charge of the dot , @xmath74 , is also determined by a single relaxation rate @xmath71 . 
 this means that both charge and spin , which are quantities related with single - particle processes , do not evolve independently from each other and the corresponding decay is given by the same rate . 
 a similar non - interacting problem has been studied _ non - pertubatively _ in refs . and .    as a next step we consider the squared deviation of the charge from its equilibrium value , @xmath75 ^ 2 $ ] . 
 its time evolution is obtained from eq . 
 ( [ eq_psigma ] ) as @xmath76 ^ 2\rangle(t)-[\langle\hat{n}\rangle^{\text{eq}}]^2\\ & & = \sum_{\sigma=\uparrow,\downarrow}[1+\langle\hat{n}_{\sigma}\rangle^{\text{eq}}]\langle\hat{n}_{\sigma}\rangle(t)+2\langle\hat{n}_{\uparrow}\hat{n}_{\downarrow}\rangle(t)\nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] the last , two - particle term of this expression exhibits a decay rate given by @xmath77 . 
 this is in contrast to the spinless case , where such a term does not appear since double occupation is not possible . 
 such an additional exponential decay with the rate @xmath78 appears directly in the time evolution of the probability vector , when considering the full two - particle hilbert space spanned by the basis @xmath79 . in this basis , eq . 
 ( [ eq_exp ] ) for the non - interacting regime can be written as :    @xmath80\\ \frac{1}{2}\left[1 - 2f(\epsilon)\right]\\ \frac{1}{2}\left[1 - 2f(\epsilon)\right]\\ f(\epsilon ) \end{array}\right ) e^{-\gamma t}\left(\langle\hat{n}\rangle^\mathrm{in}-\langle\hat{n}\rangle^\mathrm{eq}\right)\nonumber \\ 
 + \left(\begin{array}{c } 0\\ \frac{1}{2}\\ -\frac{1}{2}\\ 0 \end{array}\right ) e^{-\gamma t}\langle\hat{s}\rangle^\mathrm{in } + \left ( \begin{array}{c } -1\\1\\1\\-1 \end{array } \right ) e^{-2\gamma t}\left ( \langle\hat{m}\rangle^\mathrm{in}-\langle\hat{m}\rangle^\mathrm{eq } \right ) \nonumber\\\end{aligned}\ ] ]    where as before , @xmath81 defines the state at equilibrium . the decaying part of the probability vector can be divided into three contributions which appear depending on how the initial state at @xmath1 differs from the equilibrium state . 
 deviations of charge and spin from their equilibrium value relax with the same rate @xmath0 . 
 the corresponding expectation values are calculated by multiplying the probability vector eq . 
 ( [ ptot ] ) from the left with the vector representation of the operators @xmath82 and @xmath83 which represent the charge and spin , respectively , in this two - particle basis . 
 the two left eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath84 with the same eigenvalue @xmath85 , are given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 . 
 the third contribution to the decay of the system into the equilibrium comes from the relaxation rate @xmath78 , which enters the probability vector in connection with a quantity @xmath88 , defined by the operator in vector notation @xmath89 the left eigenvector of @xmath62 with the eigenvalue @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 . 
 in contrast to charge and spin , the quantity represented by @xmath88 does not have a straightforward intuitive interpretation , since it depends on the quantum dot parameters at @xmath33 and on the temperature and chemical potential of the reservoir via the fermi functions .      from now on we assume a finite on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath6 on the dot . 
 analogously to the noninteracting case discussed before , from eq . 
 ( [ eq_exp ] ) we can write the time - dependent probability vector in terms of contributions exhibiting different decay times    @xmath92\\ \frac{1}{2}\left[1-f(\epsilon)-f(\epsilon+u)\right]\\ \frac{1}{2}\left[1-f(\epsilon)-f(\epsilon+u)\right]\\ f(\epsilon+u ) \end{array}\right)e^{-\gamma_n t}\left(\langle\hat{n}\rangle^\mathrm{in}-\langle\hat{n}\rangle^\mathrm{eq}\right ) \nonumber \\ & & + \left(\begin{array}{c } 0\\ \frac{1}{2}\\ -\frac{1}{2}\\ 0 \end{array}\right ) e^{-\gamma_s t}\langle\hat{s}\rangle^\mathrm{in}+\left ( \begin{array}{c } -1\\1\\1\\-1 \end{array } \right ) e^{-\gamma_m t}\left ( \langle\hat{m}\rangle^\mathrm{in}-\langle\hat{m}\rangle^\mathrm{eq } \right)\ .\end{aligned}\ ] ]    again , @xmath93 is the eigenvector of @xmath51 with the zero eigenvalue and represents the equilibrium state in lowest order in the tunnel coupling ( the explicit form of the four - dimensional matrix @xmath62 , together with its entire set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors , is given in the appendix ) . 
 in the two - particle basis , again @xmath94 represents the charge operator , and @xmath95 represents the spin operator . 
 the form of the operator @xmath88 is modified by the presence of finite coulomb interaction ; the explicit form will be discussed later in this sub - section ( see eq . 
 ( [ eq_def_m ] ) below ) . 
 the initial and equilibrium expectation values for these operators , entering in the above eq . 
 ( [ eq_solution ] ) , are obtained as @xmath96 , with @xmath97 . 
 explicit expressions for @xmath98 and @xmath99 are shown below . 
 the negative of the other three eigenvalues of @xmath62 directly determine the decay of charge , spin,@xcite and the quantity denoted by @xmath88 . 
 these decay rates read    @xmath100\label{eq_lcharge1}\\ \gamma_s&=&\gamma\left[1-f(\epsilon)+f(\epsilon+u)\right]\label{eq_lspin1}\\ \gamma_m&=&2\gamma . \label{eq_lmal1}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    notice that due to interaction , the relaxation rates for charge and spin ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively ) differ from each other and depend on the level position @xmath5 , in contrast to the non - interacting case . 
 their dependence on the level position is shown in fig . 
 [ fig_decay ] . in the region for @xmath103 , @xmath101 is enhanced as the charge decays into the twofold degenerate state of single - occupation , whereas the spin relaxation in first order in @xmath0 is suppressed , since spin - flip processes are not possible . 
 however , the third decay rate , @xmath104 , remains fully energy independent as in the case with @xmath105 . 
 ( blue , dashed line ) , @xmath101 ( red , dash - dotted line ) and @xmath102 ( green , solid line ) in units of @xmath0 as a function of the dot level position @xmath5 . 
 the temperature is @xmath106 and the interaction energy is @xmath107 . ] 
 the right eigenvectors occurring in eq . 
 ( [ eq_solution ] ) each represent a change to the steady state density matrix that decays exponentially with rate @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) . 
 therefore , a system being brought out of equilibrium by a symmetric deviation between @xmath110 and @xmath111 only , is decaying with a rate @xmath102 . 
 a deviation from equilibrium in which the occupation of the even sector , @xmath112 is symmetrically shifted from the odd sector , @xmath113 , is governed solely by the relaxation rate @xmath104 . 
 this right eigenvector is found to play an important role also in the low - temperature renormalization of this model . 
 @xcite an energy - dependent change in the occupation probabilities as prescribed by the second vector in eq . 
 ( [ eq_solution ] ) yields a decay of the total charge of the system with the rate @xmath101 . 
 the conditions under which specific deviations from the equilibrium state should be performed in order to obtain a specific decay rate , are discussed in the following section . 
 the attribution of these relaxation rates to the charge , spin , and @xmath88 arises from the independent decay of these quantities , due to the explicit form of the _ left _ eigenvectors of @xmath62 . 
 the spin operator coincides with the left eigenvector associated to the eigenvalue @xmath114 and since it has a vanishing equilibrium value , the time evolution of its expectation value is given by @xmath115    equivalently , the left eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath116 , is @xmath117 . 
 it contains the charge operator @xmath118 and its equilibrium value @xmath119 $ ] . 
 hence , for the time evolution of the charge we find @xmath120     as a function of the dot level position @xmath5 . 
 the other parameters are : @xmath106 and @xmath107 . ]    the quantity decaying with the rate @xmath104 alone is related to the left eigenvector @xmath91 , where the operator @xmath88 is given by @xmath121 its expectation value follows a time evolution equivalent to the one for the charge in eq . 
 ( [ eq_nrelax ] ) : @xmath122 . 
 its equilibrium value @xmath123 $ ] , plotted in fig . 
 [ fig_meh ] , is - in contrast to spin and charge - not sensitive to the regime of single occupation on the quantum dot . 
 instead , it exhibits a feature close to the electron - hole symmetric point of the anderson model , indicating that @xmath88 represents a quantity which is affected by two - particle effects and it decays with a rate that is not modified by the coulomb interaction @xmath6 . already for the noninteracting case , we found that the rate @xmath78 appears as a consequence of introducing two particles in the system , and we considered the deviations from equilibrium charge as a quantity involving two - particle processes leading to such a decay rate . 
 also in the case for finite coulomb interaction , the time - dependent mean squared deviations @xmath124 
 ^ 2\rangle(t)$ ] are suitable to reveal the relaxation rate @xmath125 . 
 their time evolution is obtained by means of eq . 
 ( [ eq_solution ] ) and reads @xmath126 ^ 2\rangle(t ) - [ \langle \hat{n}\rangle^\mathrm{eq}]^2 & = & c\cdot\langle \hat{n}\rangle(t)-2\cdot\langle \hat{m}\rangle(t)\nonumber\\   \label{eq_variance}\end{aligned}\ ] ]     ( red , solid line ) and the coefficient @xmath127 ( blue , dashed line ) as a function of the dot level position @xmath5 . 
 the other parameters are : @xmath106 and @xmath107 . ]    where in front of the time - dependent charge @xmath128 the following coefficient appears : @xmath129 with @xmath130    the quantity @xmath131/\left[1+f(\epsilon)-f(\epsilon+u)\right]$ ] is the difference between the probability of doubly occupied and empty dot in equilibrium , which can also be related with the occupation of electrons and holes , @xmath132 . the behavior of @xmath133 is shown in fig .  [ fig_coeff ] . for @xmath134 , 
 when the dot is doubly occupied , @xmath135 ; for @xmath103 , when one electron and one hole are present in the system ( singly occupied dot ) , @xmath136 ; and for @xmath137 , when the system is completely `` filled with holes '' ( empty dot ) , @xmath138 . 
 the quantity @xmath127 is also shown in fig .  [ fig_coeff ] ( blue dashed line ) , exhibiting a sign change around @xmath139 , the point at which the anderson model is electron - hole symmetric . by replacing @xmath140 , we go from the electron - like to the hole - like behavior , finding an inversion in the sign of @xmath127 , @xmath141 . 
 the function @xmath127 therefore indicates whether the spectrum of the quantum dot is electron - like or hole - like . 
 the mean squared deviations of the charge from its value at equilibrium is an example for a physical quantities showing a decay with @xmath104 ; it also includes the charge relaxation rate @xmath101 , which is found independently from the time evolution of the charge . 
 equivalently also the time - resolved charge variance , @xmath142 ^ 2\rangle(t)$ ] , or the time - resolved spin variance,@xcite @xmath143 , contain a contribution decaying with @xmath104 . 
 we now consider in detail which external perturbations are necessary in order to induce a decay of the _ full _ occupation probability vector with one certain relaxation rate only , in a controlled way . 
 furthermore , we address the conditions under which a single decay rate can be extracted more easily from the occupation of a single state by a measurement with a nearby quantum point contact ( qpc ) . 
 we first address the case of an infinitesimal perturbation ( linear response ) . 
 a small variation of the gate potential leads to a decay of the charge governed by the charge relaxation rate @xmath101 . 
 similarly , the infinitesimal variation of the zeeman splitting in the dot yields a decay with the spin relaxation rate @xmath102 . in order to obtain a decay of the state with the rate @xmath104 only , it is not sufficient to modulate the gate voltage , also the two - particle term in the hamiltonian , @xmath144 , needs to be varied . 
 the on - site repulsion @xmath6 could be changed , for example , by tuning the carrier density in a nearby two - dimensional electron gas , thereby controlling the screening of the electron - electron interaction in the dot . from eq . 
 ( [ eq_solution ] ) we know that a dynamics given only by @xmath104 is obtained if the occupation of the even states are changed in the same direction , opposite to that of the single occupied states ; this condition is fulfilled if infinitesimal variations of the gate , @xmath145 , and of the interaction , @xmath146 , obey the relation : @xmath147)}{1+\exp(\beta\epsilon)}d\epsilon . \label{dvarm}\ ] ] this expression is represented in terms of field lines in fig .  [ fig_field ] . an infinitesimal change tangential to the field line passing through the point corresponding to the initial values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 leads to a pure decay with @xmath104 . 
 for parameter variations that are not infinitesimal ( beyond linear response ) , a change only of the gate voltage results in a decay of the state with both rates @xmath101 and @xmath104 . from eq . 
 ( [ eq_solution ] ) we find that a finite variation of the energy level and the interaction from an initial condition @xmath148 to @xmath149 resulting in a relaxation containing solely @xmath101 , satisfies the equation @xmath150 . \label{varn}\ ] ] a relaxation given _ only _ by the rate @xmath104 is found when the relation : @xmath151 \label{varm}\ ] ] is fulfilled . for different values of @xmath152 and @xmath153 , eq . 
 ( [ varm ] ) produces again the field lines shown in fig . 
 [ fig_field ] . therefore , 
 finite variations of the parameters between two points lying on _ the same _ field line yield a dynamics for the entire occupation probabilities vector @xmath154 governed only by @xmath104 . obviously , a generic variation in both @xmath5 and @xmath6 which does not fulfill the conditions specified by eqs . 
 ( [ varn ] ) or ( [ varm ] ) exhibits a dynamics of the probabilities with two time scales : @xmath101 and @xmath104 .    in fig . 
 [ fig_field ] it is observed that in the region @xmath155 the field lines are approximately horizontal , i.e , only the interaction @xmath6 needs to be varied while keeping the level position constant in order to see a dynamics of the probability governed by @xmath104 only . 
 in fact , in this regime the qd is predominantly empty and variations of the interaction strength @xmath6 do not affect the occupation of the dot . 
 this is the reason why this variation yields a dynamics in which the rate @xmath101 does not contribute . on the other hand , in the region for @xmath156 in order to avoid that the number of particles on the dot changes , which would lead to a relaxation with rate @xmath101 , a variation in @xmath6 needs to be accompanied by an opposite variation in @xmath5 , that is @xmath157 . 
 the crossover between the two regimes appears around the symmetry point of the anderson model , @xmath139 . 
 importantly , it is also possible to read out either the rate @xmath101 or the rate @xmath104 by varying the gate voltage only ( and , thus , not fulfilling eqs . 
 ( [ dvarm ] ) and ( [ varm ] ) ) , which is easier to realize in an experiment . this can be done by measuring an observable that is sensitive to only one occupation probability , for instance the probability of the quantum dot being empty . 
 such a time - resolved read - out of the probability can be achieved by considering a qpc located nearby the system and tuned such that it conducts only if the qd is empty . 
 @xcite in the simplest model of the qpc , which assumes a very fast response , the operator corresponding to the current in the qpc is given by @xmath158 where @xmath159 is a constant current , given by the characteristics of the qpc potential . 
 the expectation value of the qpc current is simply @xmath160 . in this way 
 , the qpc effectively measures the dynamics of the occupation probability @xmath161 . according to eq . 
 ( [ eq_solution ] ) , a modulation of the gate in which the initial value @xmath162 equals the equilibrium value @xmath99 leads to a pure decay with @xmath101 . instead , for a decay given by @xmath104 either the factor @xmath163 or the factor @xmath164/\left[1-f(\epsilon)+f(\epsilon+u)\right]$ ] in eq . 
 ( [ eq_solution ] ) has to vanish .    . 
 the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath6 is constant and takes the value @xmath165 . 
 dashed blue line : @xmath5 changes from @xmath166 to @xmath167 , its slope yields the relaxation rate @xmath104 . 
 red dot - dashed line : in this case @xmath168 to @xmath169 , and the slope leads to @xmath101 . the black line is obtained if @xmath5 changes from @xmath170 to @xmath169 , in which both rates @xmath104 and @xmath101 are present . in all cases 
 we have subtracted the corresponding value for the current in the long - time limit . ] 
 results for the qpc current for different variations of the level position @xmath5 while @xmath6 is kept constant , are shown in the logarithmic plot in fig . 
 [ lines ] . 
 for clarity , we also subtracted the corresponding current in the long time limit , @xmath171 . 
 in particular , for a fixed value of @xmath6 equal to @xmath172 , we find that if the level position is changed from @xmath166 to @xmath167 , the time evolution of @xmath161 is governed entirely by the rate @xmath104 , giving rise to the straight , blue - dashed line in fig . 
 [ lines ] . 
 its slope is given by @xmath104 , making it possible to extract this relaxation rate from measurements of the current in the qpc . 
 however we can obtain a dynamics of @xmath161 given mainly by the rate @xmath101 by performing a variation in @xmath5 from @xmath166 to @xmath169 which results in the red dot - dashed straight line in fig . 
 [ lines ] ; again , the slope yields the corresponding relaxation rate which takes the value @xmath173 . finally , we show an example in which variations from @xmath170 to @xmath169 ( solid black line ) produce a dynamics of @xmath161 which includes two exponential decays with rates @xmath104 and @xmath101 . as a result , 
 the curve exhibits a change in the slope , showing that a single rate will not be obtained by arbitrary variations of the parameters .      in the previous sections we investigated the relaxation rates in first order in the tunnel coupling strength @xmath0 . 
 however , corrections due to higher order tunneling processes appear when the tunnel coupling gets stronger . besides quantitative corrections , this reveals an interesting new aspect . in second order in the tunnel coupling , 
 the matrix @xmath174 included in the exponential decay takes the form @xmath175 . 
 the second - order corrections to the relaxation rates for charge and spin are given by:@xcite @xmath176w_{\mathrm{d}0 }                    }                     { 1-f(\epsilon)+f(\epsilon+u ) } \label{eq_charge_corr}\\ \gamma_\mathrm{s}^{(2 ) } & = & \sigma(\epsilon,\gamma , u ) \frac{\partial}{\partial\epsilon}\gamma_\mathrm{s}+\sigma_\gamma(\epsilon,\gamma , u)\gamma_\mathrm{s}+2w_\mathrm{sf}\ . 
 \label{eq_spin_corr}\end{aligned}\ ] ] these corrections contain renormalization terms as well as real cotunneling contributions . 
 on one hand , the renormalization terms contain an effect due to the level renormalization @xmath177 , with @xmath178 $ ] , @xmath179 and @xmath180 is the digamma function . on the other hand , the renormalization of the tunnel coupling appears , @xmath181 $ ] , with @xmath182 $ ] and where @xmath127 was defined in eq . 
 ( [ eq_coeff ] ) . 
 real cotunneling contributions are manifest in terms of spin flips , @xmath183 , and coherent transitions changing the particle number on the dot by @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 . 
 these cotunneling terms read @xmath187\\ w_{\mathrm{d}0 } & = & - \frac{2 \gamma } { e^{\beta(2\epsilon+u)}-1 }   \left[\gamma\phi'(\epsilon)+\gamma\phi'(\epsilon+u)-\frac{2}{u}\sigma(\epsilon , u)\right],\nonumber\\\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath188 w_{\mathrm{d}0}$ ] . 
 the way in which the cotunneling contributions enter in the respective charge and spin relaxation rates is related to the deviation of the state of the qd from equilibrium , given by eq . 
 ( [ eq_solution ] ) in first order in @xmath0 . as an example we discuss the correction to the charge decay rate , second line of eq . 
 ( [ eq_charge_corr ] ) . there 
 the factor @xmath184 appears due to the change in the charge by @xmath189 in a process bringing the dot from zero to double occupation and vice versa . 
 @xcite the fraction with which the transition from zero to double occupation , @xmath186 , enters the correction to the charge relaxation rate , @xmath190 , is given by the deviation from equilibrium of @xmath57 in the direction of @xmath161 , of the contribution which actually decays with @xmath101 only . 
 this is the first component of the second vector in eq . 
 ( [ eq_solution ] ) . 
 equivalently , the transition from double to zero occupation , @xmath185 , enters with the fraction given by the fourth component of the same vector , namely by the deviation from equilibrium of @xmath57 in the direction of @xmath191 . 
 strikingly , in contrast to the charge and spin relaxation rates , @xmath104 does not get renormalized at all by second order tunneling processes : @xmath192 the reason for this is that the contribution due to @xmath0 renormalization and those due to coherent processes between empty and doubly occupied dot , cancel each other . 
 the lack of second order corrections , confirms that this relaxation rate is related to a quantity which is not sensitive to the coulomb interaction . 
 the fact that corrections are missing , is also found using a renormalization - group approach . 
 another important aspect of this missing second - order correction is that it is due to an exact cancelation of the contribution due to virtual second order processes , namely the @xmath0-renormalization , with real cotunneling contributions . 
 this is in contrast to , e.g. the conductance , where only the real cotunneling processes contribute far from resonances , while renormalization terms are limited to the resonant regions .      until now , we considered the quantum dot to be coupled to a normal conducting lead . 
 however , the vicinity of a superconducting or a ferromagnetic reservoir induces correlations between electrons and holes or between charge and spin , respectively . in the following we study , in first order in the tunnel coupling strength @xmath0 , the influence of induced correlations on the relaxation rates of the dot . 
 the charge response of a noninteracting mesoscopic scattering region coupled to both normal and superconducting leads has been studied in refs .  . 
 in the previous sections we have seen that the rate @xmath104 , which together with the time decay of charge and spin determines the relaxation of the qd to the equilibrium state , is independent of the level position and the coulomb interaction and that it enters in the time evolution of quantities sensitive to two - particle effects . it is therefore expected that the rate @xmath104 will directly influence the relaxation of the charge towards the equilibrium in a setup that naturally mixes the empty and doubly occupied states of the dot . 
 this situation is obtained if the qd is not only coupled to a normal lead ( with tunnel coupling strength @xmath0 ) but also to an _ additional _ superconducting contact ( with tunnel coupling strength @xmath193 ) , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig_scheme ] ( b ) . 
 we consider only the case when the superconductor is kept at the same chemical potential as the normal lead and we set both chemical potentials to zero . 
 the only purpose of the extra lead is here to induce superconducting correlations on the dot via the proximity effect . 
 to the original hamiltonian , @xmath194 , we now add the hamiltonian for the superconducting contact and its tunnel coupling to the qd , @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the the annihilation ( creation ) operator of electrons in the lead . in the limit of a large superconducting gap @xmath197 
 the effect of the additional contact can be cast in an effective hamiltonian of the dot which includes a coupling between electrons and holes in the qd , @xmath198 . 
 the eigenstates of the proximized dot are the states of single occupation @xmath20 and other two states which are superpositions of the empty and double occupied states of the dot ( due to andreev reflection ) : @xmath199 with energies given by @xmath200 , where the level detuning between @xmath19 and @xmath21 is @xmath201 and @xmath202 is the energy splitting between the @xmath203 and @xmath204 states.@xcite in the new basis @xmath205 , the vector representing the charge operator is expressed as @xmath206 and we expect that the effect of the mixing of electrons and holes will be visible in its time evolution . in first order in the tunnel - coupling strength to the normal reservoir @xmath0 and assuming @xmath207 , we find the relaxation rates @xmath208\\ \gamma_{s , s}&= & \gamma\left[1-f(\epsilon - e_-)+f(e_+-\epsilon)\right]\\ \gamma_{s,2}&=&2\gamma.\end{aligned}\ ] ]    remarkably the eigenvalue @xmath209 remains unaffected , i.e. @xmath210 is not modified by the presence of the additional superconducting lead . 
 the spin on the dot , which is determined by the occupation probabilities of singly occupied states , still decays with a single relaxation rate given by @xmath211 , i.e. @xmath212 is an eigenvector of the kernel @xmath62 ( in the proximized basis ) . 
 in contrast , the decay of the charge to its equilibrium value is given by @xmath213                    \left(e^{-\gamma_{s,2 } t}+e^{-\gamma_{s,1}t } 
 \right )                          + \langle \hat{n}\rangle^{\mathrm{eq}}\nonumber\\ & & + a_{sc }        \frac{1}{2}\left[\langle x\rangle^{\mathrm{in}}-\langle x\rangle^{\mathrm{eq}}\right ]        \left(e^{-\gamma_{s,2 } t}-e^{-\gamma_{s,1}t}\right ) \nonumber \\ & & + \frac{1}{2}\left[\langle y\rangle^{\mathrm{in}}-\langle y\rangle^{\mathrm{eq}}\right ]        \left(e^{-\gamma_{s,2 } t}-e^{-\gamma_{s,1}t}\right ) \label{eq_nsct}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath214 and where we defined the difference in the occupation of the @xmath215 states , @xmath216 and the quantity @xmath217 , with @xmath218 . 
 the charge evolves with two different time scales , @xmath219 and @xmath220 , instead of only one as in the normal case . 
 this is a direct consequence of the mixing of the states @xmath19 and @xmath21 induced by the superconducting contact . 
 this effect opens the possibility to extract this rate by measuring the time evolution of the charge in the proximized dot .      even though the presence of a superconducting lead couples electrons and holes , the relaxation rate @xmath104 has not been modified . 
 since we associate this rate with processes involving two particles each with spin @xmath12 , it is expected that if the spin symmetry is broken by introducing a ferromagnetic contact , the rate @xmath104 will now be the sum of the tunneling rates for spin up and spin down electrons . in order to verify this 
 , we consider the hamiltonian used for the normal case and assume a spin - dependent density of states in the only reservoir attached to the quantum dot , see fig . 
 [ fig_scheme ] ( c ) . 
 this leads to spin - dependent tunnel couplings , @xmath221 and @xmath222 , which are included in the corresponding transition matrix @xmath62 . 
 diagonalization of @xmath62 yields the three relaxation rates : @xmath223 ^ 2 } \\ 
 \gamma_{f,2 } & = & \gamma-\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\left(\delta\gamma\right)^2 + 4\gamma_\uparrow\gamma_\downarrow\left[f(\epsilon)-f(\epsilon+u)\right]^2 } \\ 
 \gamma_{f , m}&= & 2 \gamma\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath224 and @xmath225 .    as in the normal case 
 , there is an eigenvalue which does not depend on the level position nor on the interaction but on the sum of the different tunneling rates : @xmath226 . 
 the appearance of such a combination of the spin - dependent tunneling strengths in the relaxation rate , confirms the statement that two - particle processes involving electrons with both spin polarizations are at the basis of the decay rate @xmath104 .    due to the ferromagnetic lead , 
 the dynamics of spin and charge are now mixed . 
 the corresponding time evolution in first order in the tunnel coupling takes the form : @xmath227(e^{-\gamma_{f,1}t}-e^{-\gamma_{f,2}t } ) \nonumber \\ 
 \langle\hat{n}\rangle_f(t ) & = & \frac{1}{2}\left[\langle \hat{n}\rangle^{\mathrm{in}}-\langle \hat{n}\rangle^{\mathrm{eq}}\right](e^{-\gamma_{f,1}t}+e^{-\gamma_{f,2}t } ) + \langle \hat{n}\rangle^{\mathrm{eq}}\nonumber \\ & & + a_c\left[\langle \hat{n}\rangle^{\mathrm{in}}-\langle \hat{n}\rangle^{\mathrm{eq}}\right](e^{-\gamma_{f,1}t}-e^{-\gamma_{f,2}t})\nonumber \\ & & + b_c\langle \hat{s}\rangle^{\mathrm{in}}(e^{-\gamma_{f,1}t}-e^{-\gamma_{f,2}t})\label{eq_decay_ferro}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where we introduced the abbreviations : @xmath228}{2\sqrt{\delta\gamma^2 + 4\gamma_\uparrow\gamma_\downarrow\left[f(\epsilon)-f(\epsilon+u)\right]^2 } } \nonumber \\ b_s & = & \frac{\delta\gamma[1+f(\epsilon)-f(\epsilon+u)]}{2\sqrt{\delta\gamma^2 + 4\gamma_\uparrow\gamma_\downarrow\left[f(\epsilon)-f(\epsilon+u)\right]^2 } } \nonumber \\ a_c & = & a_s\nonumber \\ b_c & = & \frac{\delta\gamma[1-f(\epsilon)+f(\epsilon+u)]}{2\sqrt{\delta\gamma^2 + 4\gamma_\uparrow\gamma_\downarrow\left[f(\epsilon)-f(\epsilon+u)\right]^2}}. \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] the last term in eq . 
 ( [ spin_ferro ] ) shows that at finite time @xmath32 the initial charge influences the time evolution of the spin ; similarly , the initial spin enters explicitly in the dynamics of the charge , eq . 
 ( [ eq_decay_ferro ] ) . 
 these terms persist in the non - interacting limit , revealing that the coupled evolution of charge and spin including two relaxation rates ( which for the non - interacting case take the form @xmath229 and @xmath230 ) is a direct consequence of the presence of the ferromagnetic contact . 
 in contrast , the factor @xmath231 vanishes for @xmath105 implying that it stems from the combined effect of the coulomb interaction and the breaking of the spin symmetry . as expected the independent evolution of charge and spin 
 is recovered in the limit @xmath232 . 
 the mixing of the dynamics of both , charge and spin , induced here by a ferromagnetic lead was found in ref . 
 for the case of lifted spin - degeneracy in the dot due to a finite zeeman splitting . note that for the hybrid as well as for the normal system , the sum of the energy - dependent relaxation rates equals @xmath78 , as long as the tunnel coupling @xmath0 is treated in first order , only . 
 we have studied the different time scales present in the evolution of the reduced density matrix of a single - level qd with coulomb interaction and tunnel coupled to a single reservoir , after being brought out of equilibrium . besides the relaxation rates for charge and spin 
 , we find an additional rate @xmath125 , which is independent of the energy level of the dot as well as of the interaction strength . 
 this relaxation is related to the presence of two particles in the dot and is found to be not sensitive to the coulomb interaction . 
 the time evolution of the square deviations of the charge from its equilibrium value is proposed as a physical quantity related with processes involving two - particles leading to the rate @xmath78 . in order to further elucidate the properties of this decay 
 , we analyzed the response of the system to specific variations of both , the interaction strength @xmath6 and the level position @xmath5 , finding that @xmath104 can be extracted from time - resolved measurements of the current passing through a nearby quantum point contact . 
 additionally , we analyzed two other setups : a dot proximized by a superconductor and coupled to a normal reservoir , and a dot coupled to a ferromagnetic lead . 
 in the hybrid normal - superconducting systems , we found that the time - resolved read - out of the charge represents another possibility to get access to the rate @xmath104 .

 while in general the expectation value of an operator @xmath247 is found from @xmath248 , with the full density matrix @xmath249 , this can be considerably simplified in the situation considered here , where only diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the quantum dot , collected in the vector @xmath154 , play a role . 
 the expectation value of a quantum dot operator is then obtained by multiplying its vector representation from the left hand side onto the vector @xmath154 . to show an example the expectation value of the spin on the dot 
 is obtained by multiplying @xmath154 from left by the vector @xmath250 , yielding @xmath251 . 
 similarly , all other operators for quantum dot observables can be expressed in such a vector representation .","we analyze the dynamics of a single - level quantum dot with coulomb interaction , weakly tunnel coupled to an electronic reservoir , after it has been brought out of equilibrium , e.g. by a step - pulse potential .

22,"during the last two decades , a number of new paradigms for understanding complex living systems have emerged . 
 these include , e.g. theory of dynamical systems , theory of complexity , nonlinear dynamics , evolutionary physics , and critical phenomena@xcite . among these , chaotic attractors , ( multi-)fractals , self - assemblies , dissipative structures and self - organization represent some of the most promising recent concepts . 
 a particularly important testbed for a conceptualization of pattern formation in self - organizing systems is the b  z reaction@xcite which belongs among the most extensively studied examples of chemical self - organization . 
 however , despite decades of intensive research , there are still ongoing controversies over the actual chemical kinetics ( i.e. details of rates of chemical reactions involved ) and the mesoscopic dynamics ( i.e. exact nature and mechanism of patterns formation at the mesoscopic scale ) of the b  z reaction@xcite . 
 the b  z reaction is considered as a textbook example of the so - called excitable medium@xcite . majority of available chemical models which aim to explain the chemical self - organization are based on the standard reaction - diffusion analysis and the law of mass action applied to a few selected reactions@xcite . on the other hand , 
 self - organization is a hallmark of a far - from - equilibrium dynamics which appears difficult to reconcile with a common - sense chemical reaction scheme based on the law of mass action . 
 turing patterns that appear in some reaction - diffusion models are often considered as a theoretical embodiment of the b 
 z patterns@xcite . 
 this is wrong for at least three reasons : turing patterns ( a ) can explain only wave b  z patterns but not spirals@xcite , ( b ) appear only at specific parameter values in the reaction - diffusion equations , therefore they are unstable under fluctuations of parameters ( in contrast to experiments where patterns are observably robust ) , ( c ) are stable solutions of turing s reaction - diffusion equations while , in the experiment , we observe a dynamic system on a trajectory through the state space towards a limit cycle with alternating spirals and wave fragments .    the mesoscopic description of the b  z reaction is typically modeled with a cyclic cellular automaton which often generates patterns similar to the b  z wave patterns found near to the final stage of the reaction . 
 the morphological characterization of patterns is pivotal in these approaches while chemical aspects are often of a secondary interest . 
 so far , mesoscopic studies of the b  z reaction have been limited to a low - level cellular automata@xcite which can reasonably well account only for some of the observed b 
 z wave patterns , while it is as yet unclear how to generalize these approaches to obtain a full - fledged evolution of wave patterns together with dynamics of spiral patterns . 
 to the best of our knowledge , the influence of the number of levels has been systematically studied only in one case@xcite while most of the systematic studies in the literature have been confined to maximally 8 levels@xcite .    in order to numerically implement a hotchpotch model , 
 we have adopted an approach based on the version of wilensky netlogo model@xcite . in our case 
 the model is limited to 200 achievable state levels and simulated on a square 50 @xmath0 50 grid . 
 after a random setup of the space distribution of initial centers of @xmath1 $ ] as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the maximally achievable number of levels of the cell state . the model at each time step 
 @xmath4 may proceed in four possible ways :    1 . 
 when a cell is at the @xmath5 , so - called _ quiescent _ , it may be `` infected '' by surrounding cells according to the equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a number of cells at the @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are characteristic constants of the process and @xmath3 is a maximum allowed level of state / excitation . 
 when a cell is at the @xmath13 , its new state is calculated as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a state of the @xmath16-th cell in the moore neighbourhood , which directly surrounds the examined cell , and @xmath17 is another arbitrary constant . for simplicity s sake , 
 we denote in the following text @xmath18 and @xmath17 as 2a and 2b , respectively . 
 3 .   when a cell is at the @xmath19 , then @xmath20 4 . 
 when a cell achieves the @xmath21 , then @xmath22    here we posit that our improved stochastic version of the multilevel hotchpotch model not only faithfully represents the dynamics of wave - spiral patterns of the b  z reaction but also provides insight into underlying chemical reactions in terms of the eyring activated complex theory@xcite . 
 the emergence of correct spatial structures in our model depends on the ratio between the number of available states within the elementary time lag and on the rate of the internal increase in excitation process . at appropriate levels of noise , 
 we observe a dynamical evolution of the system through circular waves up to the final stage  spiral - wave interchange . 
 this structure - stabilizing mechanism via the noise is a typical trademark of a mesoscopic description and is not simply attainable via microscopic deterministic rules . by the presence of the noise 
 , we can explain many controversies in self - organization in the nature . 
 the b  z reaction is not easily comprehensible in terms of the standard law of mass action ( which represents the `` canonical method '' of interpretation of the chemical reactivity ) . 
 this is due to the fact that the reaction space is separated into regularly evolving / travelling structures and that one has to consider a large number of interlocked chemical processes involved . in this work 
 , we report on a new cellular - automaton based stochastic model of the b  z reaction . 
 the model retains some of the key features of the multi - level hotchpotch machine which , however , outperforms both in its ability to faithfully mimic the onset stage of the b  z reaction and its potential to correctly describe the morphology of the interacting wave - spiral patters during their evolution . 
 figure 1a compares a late stage of the b  z reaction ( full data are accessible in supplementary material 1 ) in our least possible spatial constraining ( a 200-mm petri dish ) and roily conditions ( gentle mixing at 1400 rpm using an orbital mixer ) with simulation of the modified wilensky model of excitable medium@xcite . 
 the structures are , for some parameter ranges , astonishingly similar . 
 however , the most regular spirals and waves , best comparable to the model , are expected to arise in a very gently mixed , homogenous solution of thin layer in a vessel of the unlimited size which does not spatially constrain the evolution of waves .    in order to achieve the manifest morphological similarity between the b  z experiments and our simulation , we implemented the following changes into the wilensky model :    1 . 
 the enlargement of the cellular grid to 1000 @xmath0 1000 , 2 .   start from a very few points which enabled to analyze the behaviour of individual centers of emanation , 3 .   a sequence of switching the values of cell states from natural to decimal numbers which extended the span of each cellular state , 4 . 
 the addition of a uniform white noise to each automaton step which compensated for our limited knowledge of precise underlying mechanism , and 5 . 
 the extension of the number of achievable states @xmath3 and rate of the internal cell excitation @xmath17 up to 2000 and 280 , respectively , to smooth the model waves .    the first modification  usage of the finer grid 
 suppressed the influence of the nonidealities of the periodic boundaries on the evolution of the model system . 
 the second intervention into the wilensky model was performed using random - exponential function for generation of the starting ( ignition ) points . 
 multiplication of each cell state by the @xmath23 of the exponential distribution , i.e. @xmath24\ , , \ ] ] ensured that the simulation started with a small number of the ignition points .    at this initial condition , we first tested the influence of the @xmath25 of natural numbers due to the rounding in processes 12 ( see eqs . 
 ( [ eq2])-([eq3 ] ) ) , thus new states in time @xmath4 were calculated as @xmath26 and @xmath27 this modification , which was originally implemented to start the process from these few centers ( ignition points ) quite surprisingly increased the structural - patterns similarity between the b  z experiment and the simulation . 
 the results are shown in  figure 1b  c and  supplementary materials 24 and were discussed in some detail in@xcite . in  figure 1b , we present early simulation steps 2 , 4 , 14 , and 16 after the ignition in process 1 . for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , 
 at least two non - zero points in a proper configuration @xmath7 , @xmath8 were required for the evolution of the waves in the simulation , since at least one addend in process 1 has to be equal to 1 . in this case , the early evolution gave octagons ( figure 1b , i ) and final state was formed by spirals ( figure 1c , i ) . in contrast , if @xmath30 and @xmath31 , then , e.g. @xmath32 and the non - zero cell was surrounded by evolving wave of 8 cells in @xmath33 . 
 this early evolution resulted in squares with central circular objects ( figure 1b , ii ) which further led to the filamentous structures ( figure 1c , ii ) . 
 the next step softened the definition of the state by allowing 1 decimal place in eqs . 
 ( [ eq2])-([eq3 ] ) , i.e. @xmath34 and @xmath35 and kept @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( supplementary material 5 ) . 
 if @xmath36 , the first layer of 8 cells in @xmath37 evolves in the moore neighbourhood . 
 this modification provided the trajectory as observed for @xmath30 and @xmath31 with natural number states . 
 more decimal places did not change the state space trajectory any more . 
 this proves that the trajectory is determined by the ratio of the @xmath17 constant to the number of levels @xmath3 . 
 the @xmath38 ratio close to 7 ( 28/200 ) showed the highest structural similarity to the experiment . 
 there seems to be also a lower limit for the proper development of the system trajectory . in case of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we observed evolution of square spirals and the simulation grid was never fully covered by spirals and waves . at the 2/14 ratio , 
 the grid was already completely covered . at the 3/20 ratio , 
 the circular structures similar to those observed in the experiment were firstly observed . at keeping the @xmath38 ratio , 
 the next increase of the @xmath3 value smoothed only the edges of the structures . 
 obviously , 7 state levels does not allow to cover the moore space with 8 neighbouring cells and 14 state levels are not yet sufficient enough to create an appropriate curvature . 
 the course of the simulation and the type of the limit set ( late state ) depends on the type of the _ garden of eden _ as follows : a ) the emergence of the ignition point needs one or two neighbouring non - zero points and determines the overall type of the trajectory and b ) the number and distribution of ignition centers determines the duration of each trajectory phase . 
 there are as many gardens of eden as possible geometrical set - ups of the ignition points , however , the thickness of square and circular waves , shapes of the central objects and the structure of the limit set remain the same . 
 the multilevel cellular automata exhibit less versatile trajectory than the low - level ones@xcite .    in order to compensate our lack of knowledge of the details of the process , we introduced noise into each sub - process in eqs . 
 ( [ eq2])-([eq3 ] ) by multiplication of the terms @xmath41 , @xmath18 , and @xmath17 , respectively , by the factor @xmath42 . 
 the noise was generated by a computer random number generator and its level was upper limited to be the uniform noise within certain range . at @xmath28 , @xmath29 and 
 precision of 10 decimal places , levels of noise were 6% , 12% , and 30% for @xmath41 , @xmath18 , and @xmath17 , respectively . 
 when ignition led to circular structures with filled interior , the noise restored spiral formation ( figure 1b  c , iii and supplementary material 5 ) and the simulation was the most similar to the experiment ( figure 2 and supplementary material 1 ) . 
 in other experiments at @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( data not shown ) , we observed that the respective noise levels gave the same trajectory . 
 a formation of circular structures which arose as watersheding of regular structures was also the same as observed for the natural - number states . 
 the proper combination of @xmath38 values and uniform noise range ( figure 2a ) generates a sequence of simulated structures as follows :    * the simulation grid is filled with systems of square dense waves 
 . this has not been observed in the experiment and we interpret it as a _ lag phase _ , which precedes the observed formation of circular waves . 
 * circular structures emanate from the centre of square waves . 
 * at the certain state , the simulation grid is nearly covered by large circular structures . 
 a few spirals occur and break into a new generation of spirals . * final state is similar to that in the simulation where the states are natural numbers , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( supplementary material 4 ) , however , the waves are about 2 grid elements thicker . * in the terminology of the multilevel cellular automata@xcite , the uniform ( white ) noise shifts the system to the basin of attraction similar to the system where only natural numbers are allowed and open a novel system trajectory through the state space . 
 let us mention further key similarities between our simulation and actual experiments ( figure 2b  c ) :    * the chemical waves do not interfere like material waves but merge . * the chemical waves 
 do not maintain the shape ( as is the case , e.g. , for solitons@xcite ) . 
 * the morphology of interacting patterns ( merger patterns ) in simulations has comparable traits as in real experiments . * quantitative features of the limit sets , 
 i.e. , the last evolutionary stage of the wave - spiral patterns can be set as close as possible to actual experimental data by an appropriate choice of the parameter range . 
 it should be stressed that the possibility to replace partly the elementary anisotropy by the uniform noise ( see figure 4 )  the constructive role of the noise  is a novel observation , which can be viewed as a superposition of starting conditions .      when noise matters , an observed process is typically mesoscopic 
 it does follow neither the deterministic rules of the microscopic ( or purely mechanical ) system nor the statistical - physics tenet of boltzmann that only the most frequent events are observed@xcite . 
 so , in case of the b  z reaction , a chemical origin of mesoscopicity should be sought . 
 the key process at the end of the reaction scheme is the breakage of a crucial chemical bond in the eyring transition state complex , possibly the decomposition of brominated malonic acid to formic acid and carbon dioxide@xcite . 
 a sketch of molecules involved in the last reaction step is outlined in  figure 3 . 
 this process is hidden in the experiment in which we observe only the reduction of the fe@xmath43-phenanthroline complex . 
 the rest of , known and unknown , reactions in all their reaction intermediates contributes to the restoration of this activated complex . 
 the activated complex consequently reduces fe@xmath43 which enables our measurement . 
 the scheme described here still includes breakage of a few individual bonds , possibly in certain orders . 
 moreover , it is not certain that this redox process is the bottleneck process . 
 it should be also noted that there is a deep controversy about the actual details of the mechanism including the role of molecules involved in the carbon dioxide evolution . 
 thus the proposed chemical mechanism must be understood more as illustration of the complexity and of the origin of time extent of key reaction steps . 
 the chemical reaction is certainly not occurring at timeless instant as it is assumed in the reaction  diffusion model . 
 we propose that the state changes of the activated complex are described by processes 23 ( see eqs . 
 ( [ eq3])-([eq4 ] ) ) . 
 process 4 ( see eq . 
 ( [ eq5 ] ) ) represents the breakage of the complex , which vacates the space for the restoration of a new activated complex in process 1 ( see eq . 
 ( [ eq2 ] ) ) . the mesoscopicity may be explained from the multitude of processes involved in these elementary steps .    to examine properties of the elementary spatial unit ( pixel in the simulation ) 
 , we analyzed the properties of process 2 . 
 we assume that process 2 ( see eq . 
 ( [ eq3 ] ) ) reflects all reorganization processes and reactions of all parts of the complex , down to the level of a bond which breaks upon the disruption of the complex . 
 we split the process into sub - processes 2a and 2b . 
 process 2a is the sum of all processes which occur between the elementary spatial unit and the immediate surroundings . 
 larger surroundings were ignored , since their influence was assumed to be mediated by neighbouring elementary units . 
 process 2b represents all processes within this unit . 
 the relatively high noise level of 0.14 and 0.30 for process 2a and 2b , respectively , includes our ignorance of the details and randomness of the process . 
 figure 4a and supplementary material 6 show the results of the noise - free simulation at @xmath44 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and different @xmath17 . at the @xmath45 , 
 the process exhibited the same trajectory as at the @xmath46 . at the @xmath47 , 
 the process was in its initial part similar to the course at the @xmath46 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , later , it tended to give round structures . at the @xmath48 , 
 the course of the simulation was very different from any previous simulation . 
 the final state of this simulation was characterized by spiral doublets  ram s horns@xcite . at the @xmath49 , 
 the process was already very diffusive . 
 obviously , the ratio between the constants of processes 2a and 2b determines the geometry of the process . 
 for the course of the simulation similar to the experiment , the suitable @xmath38 ratio is equal to 7 . 
 the values of constants @xmath17 and @xmath3 themselves do not significantly influence the course of the simulation . 
 the time needed for the decay of the active state complex and its restoration in process 4 determines the characteristic timescale of the whole simulation . 
 the ratio @xmath38 determines properties of waves and the size of the spatial unit . 
 this ratio represents an aliquot of energy / entropy needed for the decay of the transition state complex in process 2b . in order to observe waves , process 
 2b needs to be significantly faster than the transition from the neighbourhood in process 2a and , also , the neighbourhood has to be asymmetric . in other words , noise represents geometric asymmetry ( 2a noise ) and internal kinetic irregularity ( 2b noise ) of the neighbourhood . 
 figure 5 shows the analysis of wave profiles in the b  z experiment . 
 the striking similarity of the simulation to real experiment intensity profiles of dense waves ( figures 1 , 2 and 5 ) motivated us to guess the number of molecules per an elementary spatial unit ( i.e. the pixel of experimental wave ) . 
 the number of elementary units per the width of the wave was in the range of 1020 . 
 since the average width of the wave was 1.5 mm , the elementary unit had 0.070.15 mm . 
 the solution above the elementary unit had thickness and volume of 0.5 mm and 10@xmath50 mm@xmath51 , respectively . 
 then , the solution contained ca . 
 3 @xmath0 10@xmath52 and 10@xmath53 molecules of water and reactants per elementary unit , respectively . 
 this number lies within the thermodynamic limit . 
 the source of the mesoscopicity has to be sought in the physico  chemical dynamics . 
 it means that only a few energetic / re - organizational events occur within a given time . since 
 an elementary spatial unit contains roughly 10@xmath53 molecules of reactants , it is probably unsatisfactory to explain the energetic transition only due to one eyring - type reaction complex . 
 it is likely that we are dealing with a phase separation which gives rise to structures of an analogous type as , e.g. , in liquid crystals@xcite . 
 both wavy and spiral patterns often occur in the nature . however , despite being usually formed in continuous media , they can also be generated artificially in the threshold - range of cyclic multilevel cellular automata@xcite . 
 the generation of waves and spirals in cellular automata has been initially perceived by the scientific community with scepticism@xcite . 
 the reasons why the formation of spirals by cellular automata is not easily accepted by general chemical community is a ) the enforcement of the natural number states ( i.e. , a coarsening of the configuration space ) b ) and the need of discrete dynamics on a regular grid which is driven by deterministic albeit not differential rules . in our simulation , the former limitation is completely suppressed by a ( near)continuous set of levels . 
 the latter limitation seems to be only a prejudice . whereas the formation of bnard cells in rayleigh 
 bnard convection is driven by temperature gradient@xcite and the speed gradient generate cells in the taylor 
 couette flow , the gibbs energy gradient drives the discrete cells formation in the b  z reaction . 
 the basic principles of the formation of waves and spirals , i.e. the specific mesoscopic behaviour , are in our simulation following :    * proper @xmath38 ratio for a given spatial discretization@xcite . 
 a high and low @xmath38 ratio promotes structural asymmetry and diffussiveness , respectively . 
 * presence of sufficient amount of irregularities due to other processes of comparable rates and leads to a noise , which is specific to each ( sub)-process . only at the appropriate combination of noise in processes 2a and 2b , we observed concentric circular waves followed by spirals . 
 when the specific noise , given by decimal places in state levels , by the pulsed white noise , we may conclude that an increase of the noise in process 2a  i.e. increase of the diffusiveness  leads to the faster formation of spirals without any circular waves . 
 the asymmetry of the surroundings of the elementary unit , as observed in the simulation with natural number state levels , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , is probably a sub - set of the appropriate specific noises modulating the wavefront . 
 we call the whole range of state - level distributions , which attenuate the specific mesoscopic behaviour , a mesoscopic noise 
 .    main differences between the experiment and the simulation are following :    1 .   in the simulation , 
 formation of a few dense waves precedes the emanation of circular waves ( never observed in the experiment ) . 
 2 .   in the experiment , 
 four different wave frequencies are observed ( not yet achieved in the simulation ) . 
 3 .   in the simulation 
 , dense waves / spirals are arising from remnants of broken initial dense waves . in the experiment 
 , we observe a formation of new centers of dense waves , often at place of evolving micro - bubbles . but 
 scenario of broken waves may also be found by careful inspection of the experiment . 
 4 .   in the experiment 
 , after the state of dense waves / spirals , the system still evolves . 
 the waves broaden due to the exhaustion of chemical energy ( see a re - started experiment in supplementary material 1 ) . 
 many differences may be attributed to our ignorance of the proper character of the underlying mesoscopic noise . 
 the introduction of two noise levels into the simulation indicates that the mesoscopic noise originates from two different physico - chemical processes which lead to the geometrical and kinetic asymmetry .    even if we use the square tessellation and neighbourhood which allows to cover the whole simulation grid 
 the moore neighbourhood , the simulation exhibits the formation of _ circles_. a symmetrical ignition rule gives rise to circles and filamentous structures , whereas the simplest asymmetrical ignition leads to interchanges of spirals and waves ( with fractal - like structure ) 
 . the noise provides a proper condition for switching between these two tendencies . 
 the question remains whether the same rules of ignition and noise introduction give rise to the same geometrical structures in any tessellation or whether the neighbourhood of the active complex is , for some reason , due to the physico - chemical , or a more fundamental physical or geometric , principle , always a moore - like neighbourhood . 
 we can imagine some organization of molecules into a near - regular square lattice which is maintained by chemical dynamics ( i.e. , by movement of the molecules ) , similar to that by which the bnard cell arises in thin layers of viscous liquids . 
 we assume that the time is discretized by a step needed for the bottleneck process , i.e. for the restoration of the original concentrations of molecules in spatial element after their depletion . 
 it is described by processes 34 ( see eqs . 
 ( [ eq4])-([eq5 ] ) ) and represented by 2 time elements . 
 all other processes are related to this time measure . 
 thus , for the formation of the proper structures , a near regular structure ( lattice ) where the processes of depletion and repletion take 7 and 2 time elements , respectively , is needed . in the noise - free hotchpotch machine , 
 mixtures of spirals and waves are formed in a relatively broad range of the @xmath38 ratio@xcite  between @xmath54 and @xmath55 . 
 all these arguments , including the trajectory of any described multilevel cellular automaton , explain the great similarity to the reaction . 
 let us conclude that a computer - based reaction - diffusion model of the b  z reaction is calculated on a regular grid and all but the fastest process are represented by a stepwise increase / decrease . from this point of view , any reaction - diffusion model is a special kind of the cellular automaton@xcite . 
 apart from a few special cases when an analytic solution of turing patterns may be used@xcite , the threshold - range cellular automaton offers promising and very realistic tool for description and modelling of the chemical self - organization .     and @xmath29 ( * ii * ) .

23,"the cosmic ray energy spectrum is nearly featureless over ten orders of magnitude in energy , from @xmath0 ev to @xmath1 ev , with the differential flux falling approximately as @xmath2 . 
 there are three small , though widely discussed , features : the `` knee '' , a hardening of the spectrum at @xmath3 ev ; the `` second knee '' , another hardening at about @xmath4 ev ; and the `` ankle '' , a softening of the spectrum at about @xmath5 ev . 
 these features may represent changes in the sources , composition or dynamics of the cosmic rays . 
 two often asked questions are : how do cosmic rays come to have such high energies ( a joule or more of kinetic energy in a proton or other sub - atomic particle ) , and does the spectrum continue above @xmath1 ev ?    there are two types of models describing the sources of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) : astrophysical models ( `` bottom - up '' ) , in which cosmic rays are accelerated to very high energies by magnetic shock fronts moving though plasmas ; and cosmological models ( `` top - down '' ) , in which the cosmic rays are the result of the decays of super heavy particles which are relics of the big bang . 
 i will only be discussing the former . 
 one can evaluate the plausibility of various astrophysical sources by considering the magnetic field of the object and its size.@xcite the overall magnetic field contains the nascent cosmic rays during their acceleration and thus must be large enough to keep the cosmic rays within the object . 
 smaller objects need larger fields ; larger objects , smaller fields . by this criterion 
 we have several candidate sources : neutron stars , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and clusters of galaxies among others . 
 all these sources could plausibly , by the above argument , give cosmic rays at @xmath1 ev , but , in all cases , one is pushing the bounds of plausibility at the highest energies . 
 if uhecrs are extragalactic , then they must traverse the intergalactic medium in order to be observed . 
 this medium is filled with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , which should lead to a fourth , and not so small , feature of the uhecr spectrum . because of their large kinetic energies , uhecrs interact with the cmb to produce resonances ( in the case of protons ) or to dissociate ( in the case of nuclei ) . in the proton case 
 , the resonance ( e.g. @xmath6 ) will decay quickly into proton or neutron and a meson ( e.g. @xmath7 ) . in either case , 
 the result is a reduction in the energy of the leading particle . at somewhat lower energies , 
 cosmic rays lose energy by creating electron - positron pairs in their interaction with the cmb . 
 these energy loss mechanisms imply that there should be a sharp reduction in the uhecr flux above @xmath8 ev , assuming the uhecrs are protons and that they come from distances greater than a few tens of megaparsecs . 
 nuclei should have an even lower energy threshold . 
 this fact , first pointed out by greisen , zatsepin and kuzmin , has become known as the gzk cutoff.@xcite by measuring the shape of the uhecr spectrum and , crucially , modeling the spectrum at the source , one can hope to deduce which of the plausible sources listed above , if any , contribute to the uhecrs we see . 
 if uhecrs are produced in our galaxy they are not subject to the gzk cutoff . however , there are no plausible astrophysical accelerators of uhecrs within our galaxy 
 . any such object would appear as a point source in a map of the sky made with uhecrs , due to the short propagation distances and relatively weak magnetic fields . 
 no such point source has been observed . 
 uhecrs have a very low flux , so one must have a large collection area to obtain a reasonable event rate . 
 this precludes direct observations of uhecr above the earth s atmosphere in satellite experiments . 
 however , one may also use that atmosphere as a giant calorimeter , because uhecrs create extensive air showers ( eass ) when they encounter the atmosphere . 
 this allows access to very large areas . 
 there are two ways to instrument this atmospheric calorimeter : readout the particle multiplicities at the back end by putting arrays of detectors on the ground , or collect the light produced as the eas gives up its energy to the atmosphere . 
 the former technique ( ground arrays ) has the advantage of 100% duty cycle : one can run at all times of the day . 
 it has the disadvantage that one usually observes only the tail end of the eas and has to infer the properties of the primary particle rather indirectly . to illustrate , consider the lead - scintillator sandwich type calorimeter used in many fixed - target experiments at accelerators . 
 one normally collects the light produced by the shower as it goes through the scintillator segments . 
 the total light is proportional to the energy of the initial particle , and one can in principle measure the longitudinal development of the shower . 
 now imagine throwing away the signals from all but the last scintillator segment and one can understand the difficulties faced by ground arrays . 
 one must also make a trade - off between density of detectors on the ground and the total area over which one places detectors . 
 collecting the fluorescence light from eass has complementary advantages and disadvantages . 
 the main advantage is that one observes light from all stages in the development of the eas , and the amount of this light is directly proportional to the primary energy . 
 the disadvantage is that one is subject to the optical changes inherent in the atmosphere and one can only run when and where it is dark and clear . as a counterpart to the example above 
 , fluorescence detectors are like lead - glass calorimeters , where one collects light from the whole detector element . however , the glass may be somewhat smoky .    the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa)@xcite is the largest , currently active example of a ground array . 
 the agasa collaboration claims to see no evidence for the gzk cutoff,@xcite which has motivated a great deal of theoretical work on possible mechanisms by which the gzk cutoff could be avoided . 
 the fly s eye experiment@xcite is an example of a fluorescence detector , and the experiment that has observed the highest energy cosmic ray ever detected at @xmath9 ev.@xcite the pierre auger observatory,@xcite currently under construction , will combine both a very large ground array and a fluorescence detector , in an effort to have the advantages of both types of detectors . 
 the high resolution fly s eye experiment ( hires ) is a direct descendant of fly s eye , designed with bigger mirrors and finer pixels , to give a larger aperture by a factor of ten . 
 it consists of two sites , separated by 12 km , in order to observe eass in stereo . 
 stereo observation greatly reduces the uncertainty in the geometrical reconstruction of the eas . 
 the sites are located on hills on the dugway proving grounds in the west desert of utah . 
 the remote desert provides a dark , optically clean atmosphere , while the hills put the detectors above much of the remaining aerosols . 
 each detector consists of mirror units viewing a @xmath10 patch of the sky with 256 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , each of which views about @xmath11 , in a @xmath12 array . 
 each mirror has an area of about 5 m@xmath13 . 
 the hires - i site , the first of the two to be built , has one ring of mirrors covering from @xmath14@xmath15 and nearly the complete azimuth . the pmts are read out using a sample - and - hold technique , that gives the time and size of the signal for each tube . 
 the hires - ii site has two rings of mirrors covering @xmath14@xmath16 . 
 these pmts are read out using a flash adc ( fadc ) system , which samples each of the tubes every 100 ns . 
 this provides the shape of the signal in each tube and allows one to combine the light from different tubes that were active at the same time . 
 hires - i began operation in june of 1997 . 
 hires - ii began in october of 1999 . 
 the reader is referred to the published fly s eye@xcite and hires@xcite papers for details of the reconstruction techniques . 
 only a brief summary will be given here . 
 although hires was designed as a stereo experiment , there are two reasons for continuing to consider monocular analyses . 
 first , since hires - i was running for two years before hires - ii came on - line , the largest uhecr data sample is the hires - i monocular sample . 
 second , low - energy events are close to one or the other of the two sites , and trigger that site only . 
 thus , the low - energy reach of the detector will always be in monocular mode . 
 hires - ii is a better detector for reconstructing monocular events , due to its two rings : longer tracks lead to a better determination of the eas geometry . 
 there are two tasks in determining the geometry of an eas : finding the shower - detector plane ( sdp ) and determining the angle of the shower within the sdp . 
 the geometry of the shower within the sdp is determined by fitting the time of the tube signals @xmath17 for @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the signal time in the @xmath22th tube , @xmath18 is the impact parameter , @xmath20 is the time the shower core reaches the @xmath18 point , @xmath19 is the angle of the eas in the sdp and @xmath23 is the viewing angle in the sdp of the @xmath22th tube . 
 longer tracks make it easier to distinguish the tangent function from a straight line 
 . hires - i tracks are often too short to resolve all the ambiguities from timing alone , and one must look to the reconstructed shower profile ( see below ) for assistance in determining the geometry .    as an example , a picture of a 50 eev cosmic ray event from hires - ii , given in fig .  [ 
 fig : mirror - tvsa ] , shows the azimuthal and elevation angles of all the tubes in the mirrors that were part of the event . 
 inactive tubes are shown as dots ; active tubes are shown as filled circles , where the radius is proportional to the tube signal . 
 active tubes that are used in fitting the sdp are shaded according to the average time of the fadc measurements of the tube . 
 the fitted sdp is also shown in the figure . 
 the average time of the signal for each tube as a function of the angle ( @xmath23 ) in the sdp is also shown for the same event , including three fits to eq .

 the three fits are from eq  [ eq : tvsa ] with @xmath24 ( light grey ) , @xmath25 ( dark grey ) the best fit @xmath19 ( black).,title=""fig : "" ]      once the geometry of the eas is determined , one can use the photoelectron ( npe ) signal of the pmts to determine the number of charged particles , @xmath26 , in the shower . in making this @xmath27 conversion , 
 two important calibration issues come into play : the gains of the pmts , and the atmospheric transparency to light . 
 pmt gains are monitored nightly and monthly using a xenon flash lamp and yag laser . 
 the atmosphere is monitored using a bistatic lidar system . 
 the hires - ii analysis combines the pe signal from all the tubes in a given time bin , and converts this into a given number of charged particles in the eas at a given depth in the atmosphere ( measured in g / cm@xmath13 ) . 
 this conversion is strongly dependent on the geometry . 
 one can estimate the energy of a shower from the number of charged particles , the amount of material traversed , and the average energy deposited per particle : @xmath29 since one often does not see the entire eas , one must assume some profile of the number of charged particles for the unobserved part of the shower . 
 we use the gaisser - hillas parameterization @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the depth at the maximum extent of the eas , @xmath32 is the number of particles at that depth , @xmath33 corresponds to the depth of the first interaction , and @xmath34 is the interaction length . 
 we fitted the observed portion of the shower to determine @xmath31 and @xmath32 , holding @xmath35 g / cm@xmath13 ( which is not physical , but gives the best fits when applied to simulations using corsika@xcite ) and @xmath36 g / cm@xmath13 . 
 some of the observed light comes from the beam of erenkov light generated by the eas and scattered into the detector . 
 this light is subtracted from the signal in an iterative procedure . 
 the photoelectron signal as a function of time and the calculated @xmath26 as a function of depth for the same 50 eev event are shown in fig . 
 [ fig : profile ] .     profiles in the 50 eev event of fig . 
 fig : mirror - tvsa . in the the upper plot , points with error bars show the photoelectron signal ( npe ) from all tubes included within a given time bin . 
 the dashed and doted lines show calculations for the fluorescence and erenkov components of the signal , respectively , for this event at the best fit values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; the solid line shows the sum of the components . in the lower plot , 
 filled points with error bars show the calculated @xmath26 extracted from the npe signal as a function of depth in the atmosphere . 
 the open points without error bars show the result of the calculation without subtracting off the erenkov component . ] 
 the energy is calculated from the hires - i signals in a similar way , except that the expected number of pe for a given shower is compared with the observed value . 
 in other words , the fit is done using the number of pe at the detector rather than the extracted number of charged particles in the shower . 
 the comparison is also done on a tube - by - tube basis rather than in time bins . 
 after events are reconstructed , one must select the sample from which to calculate the flux . 
 this sample should be as large as possible and contain only well reconstructed events . 
 the criteria used to make this selection are listed in table  [ tab : cuts ] . 
 [ tab : cuts ] 
 to determine the flux of uhecr , one needs to know the aperture over which the uhecrs are collected . 
 this aperture varies with energy and must be determined through monte carlo ( mc ) simulation . 
 however , one can also use mc simulation to check that one understands the data and its reconstruction in the detector . extensive comparisons of distributions in data and in simulated samples of events provides confidence that the calculated aperture is correct . 
 the details of mc event generation have been published elsewhere.@xcite it is clear , however , that one needs to model the details of the trigger , the extra tube distribution , and the transmission of light in the atmosphere to sufficient accuracy to obtain good agreement between data and mc . 
 i will show four comparisons between data and mc , all taken from the hires - ii analysis . 
 the first , in fig . 
 [ fig : mcnpe - geo ] , shows the distribution of observed light ( npe ) divided by the track length . 
 the light distribution is sensitive to the yield , trigger , and geometry , among other things . 
 the second and third comparisons , also in fig . 
 [ fig : mcnpe - geo ] , show the distributions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 . 
 the good agreement gives us confidence in our calculation of the aperture . finally , there is the energy distribution in fig  [ fig : mcenergy ] , which enters directly into the calculation of the flux . 
 note that the energy distribution has a binning such that there are no bins with less than two events . 
 the hires - ii aperture , with the same binning , is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : aperture ] .     and 
 @xmath19 ( right ) between data ( points ) and mc ( histogram ) where in each case the mc distribution has been normalized to have the same area as the data . 
 the bottom plots show the ratio of the two above distributions : data / mc.,title=""fig : "" ]   and @xmath19 ( right ) between data ( points ) and mc ( histogram ) where in each case the mc distribution has been normalized to have the same area as the data . 
 the bottom plots show the ratio of the two above distributions : data / mc.,title=""fig : "" ] 
 with the event samples in hand , and confidence in our calculated aperture , we can extract the flux . fig . 
 [ fig : fluxm3 ] , shows the calculated flux from hires - i ( triangles ) and hires - ii ( circles ) . 
 the fluxes have been multiplied by @xmath37 in order to emphasize changes in the spectral index .    , as measured by hires - i ( triangles ) and hires - ii ( circles ) . 
 the solid line is a two component fit to the data consisting of a galactic ( dotted line ) and extragalactic ( dashed line ) spectrum . 
 the extragalactic sources evolve as @xmath38 with @xmath39 and have a distribution modified by the observed density of galaxies . ]    to evaluate the significance of these spectra , i have fitted the measured points to an astrophysical model of the sources and propagation of uhecrs . in choosing this model , 
 i have been motivated by occam s razor , sticking with known physical processes , and assuming only that the extragalactic sources of uhecr are distributed throughout the universe , and evolve in their density in the same way as the luminous matter in galaxies . to this 
 is added a phenomenologically motivated galactic spectrum at lower energies . 
 the extragalactic spectrum is assumed to consist of protons , and have a power law spectrum at the source , with a fitted spectral slope parameter . 
 this spectrum is modified by energy losses as the uhecrs traverse the intra - galactic medium . 
 the energy loss formalism is taken from the work of berezinsky _ 
 et al_.@xcite the sources are taken to be uniformly distributed out to a red - shift of @xmath40 , with a density at any given @xmath41 modified by the observed density of galaxies at that red - shift@xcite and evolving as @xmath38 with @xmath39 ( which is the best fit value and approximately the same as the observed stellar formation rate@xcite ) . using @xmath42 , increases the @xmath43 of the fit by 3.5 while not accounting for the observed density of galaxies increases the @xmath43 by 1.5 . 
 the galactic component of the spectrum is assumed to consist of iron nuclei . 
 motivation for this assumption comes from the fly s eye composition measurement,@xcite which shows an approximately linear ( in @xmath44 ) change from a heavy composition ( iron ) to a light one ( protons ) . 
 the spectral form is assumed to be @xmath2 , consistent with the uhecr spectrum below @xmath45 ev , multiplied by a linear ( in @xmath44 ) factor going from unity at @xmath45 ev , to zero at @xmath46 ev . 
 the fact that this model fits the data so well is due to agreement in its three features . 
 first , the model clearly has a drastic reduction in flux above the gzk energy , a reduction which is also observed in the data , but with not as yet overwhelming statistical significance . 
 more strongly constrained by observation are the `` second knee '' and `` ankle '' , which in this model are the result of electron pair production.@xcite the strength of the astrophysical source model is that it fits both the electron pair - production features and the pion production feature ( the gzk cutoff ) in the spectrum . 
 hires has recently announced preliminary measurements of the uhecr energy spectrum using each of its two detectors in monocular mode . 
 we have fitted this spectrum to a two - component model of the uhecr sources , the extragalactic component of which conforms to the expectation of a nearly unform distribution of sources , modified by the observed distribution of luminous matter and its evolution as a function of red - shift . 
 this model fits all the recognized features of the uhecr spectrum , not just the gzk cutoff . 
 much has been made of the discrepancies between hires and agasa , with agasa seeing no evidence for the gzk cutoff , and hires being consistent with its presence . 
 however , at energies below the gzk cutoff , the two experiments agree nicely in the shape of the spectrum , with only an offset in the flux , which can be attributed to a difference in energy scale within the stated systematic uncertainty of either experiment.@xcite 
 while comments about the conformity of the hires spectra with the gzk cutoff are my own opinions , the measurement of the spectra themselves would not have been possible without my colleagues in the hires collaboration , to whom i feel indebted for the realization of this work .

 _ , the hires spectra favor a distribution of extragalactic sources that has a similar distribution to that of luminous matter in the universe , both in its local over - density and in its cosmological evolution .",the energy loss formalism is taken from the work of berezinsky _ et al_ xcite the sources are taken to be uniformly distributed out to a red shift of with a density at any given modified by the observed density of galaxies at that red shift xcite and evolving as with which is the best fit value and approximately the same as the observed stellar formation rate xcite . the fly s eye experiment xcite is an example of a fluorescence detector and the experiment that has observed the highest energy cosmic ray ever detected at ev xcite the pierre auger observatory xcite currently under construction will combine both a very large ground array and a fluorescence detector in an effort to have the advantages of both types of detectors. however at energies below the gzk cutoff the two experiments agree nicely in the shape of the spectrum with only an offset in the flux which can be attributed to a difference in energy scale within the stated systematic uncertainty of either experiment xcite while comments about the conformity of the hires spectra with the gzk cutoff are my own opinions the measurement of the spectra themselves would not have been possible without my colleagues in the hires collaboration to whom i feel indebted for the realization of this work. two often asked questions are how do cosmic rays come to have such high energies a joule or more of kinetic energy in a proton or other sub atomic particle and does the spectrum continue above ev there are two types of models describing the sources of ultra high energy cosmic rays uhecrs astrophysical models bottom up in which cosmic rays are accelerated to very high energies by magnetic shock fronts moving though plasmas and cosmological models top down in which the cosmic rays are the result of the decays of super heavy particles which are relics of the big bang. we fitted the observed portion of the shower to determine and holding g cm xmath13 which is not physical but gives the best fits when applied to simulations using corsika xcite and g cm xmath13. the geometry of the shower within the sdp is determined by fitting the time of the tube signals for and where is the signal time in the tube is the impact parameter is the time the shower core reaches the point is the angle of the eas in the sdp and is the viewing angle in the sdp of the tube. this fact first pointed out by greisen zatsepin and kuzmin has become known as the gzk cutoff xcite by measuring the shape of the uhecr spectrum and crucially modeling the spectrum at the source one can hope to deduce which of the plausible sources listed above if any contribute to the uhecrs we see. the three fits are from eq eq tvsa with light grey dark grey the best fit black title fig once the geometry of the eas is determined one can use the photoelectron npe signal of the pmts to determine the number of charged particles in the shower. the details of mc event generation have been published elsewhere xcite it is clear however that one needs to model the details of the trigger the extra tube distribution and the transmission of light in the atmosphere to sufficient accuracy to obtain good agreement between data and mc. the three fits are from eq eq tvsa with light grey dark grey the best fit black title fig ev uhecr event as seen on the mirrors pmts of the detector left and in a time vs sdp angle plot right ,0.20425531914893616,0.0910384068278805,0.10780141843971631
24,"geometrical dynamics is a dynamics of elementary particles , generated by the space - time geometry . in the space - time of minkowski 
 the geometrical dynamics coincides with the conventional classical dynamics , and the geometrical dynamics may be considered to be a generalization of classical dynamics onto more general space - time geometries . 
 however , the geometric dynamics has more fundamental basis , and it may be defined in multivariant space - time geometries , where one can not introduce the conventional classical dynamics . 
 the fact is that , the classical dynamics has been introduced for the space - time geometry with unlimited divisibility , whereas the real space - time has a limited divisibility . 
 the limited divisibility of the space - time is of no importance for dynamics of macroscopic bodies . 
 however , when the size of moving bodies is of the order of the size of heterogeneity , one may not neglect the limited divisibility of the space - time geometry . 
 the geometric dynamics is developed in the framework of the program of the further physics geometrization , declared in @xcite . 
 the special relativity and the general relativity are steps in the development of this program . 
 necessity of the further development appeared in the thirtieth of the twentieth century , when diffraction of electrons has been discovered . 
 the motion of electrons , passing through the narrow slit , is multivariant . 
 as far as the free electron motion depends only on the properties of the space - time , one needed to change the space - time geometry , making it to be multivariant . in multivariant geometry 
 there are many vectors @xmath1 , @xmath2, ... at the point @xmath3 , which are equal to the vector @xmath4 , given at the point @xmath5 , but they are not equal between themselves , in general . 
 such a space - time geometry was not known in the beginning of the twentieth century . 
 it is impossible in the framework of the riemannian geometry . as a result 
 the multivariance was prescribed to dynamics . to take into account multivariance , 
 dynamic variables were replaced by matrices and operators . 
 one obtains the quantum dynamics , which differs from the classical dynamics in its principles . 
 but the space - time conception remains to be newtonian ( nonrelativistic ) . 
 multivariant space - time geometry appeared only in the end of the twentieth century @xcite . 
 the further geometrization of physics became to be possible . 
 it should note that there were numerous attempts of further geometrization of physics . 
 they were based on the riemannian space - time geometry . 
 unfortunately , the true space - time geometry of microcosm does not belong to the class of riemannian geometries , and approximation of real space - time geometry by a riemannian geometry can not be completely successful . in particular , the riemannian geometry can not describe such a property of real space - time geometry as multivariance . 
 the multivariance of the space - time geometry was replaced by the multivariance of dynamics ( quantum theory ) . 
 understanding of nature of elementary particles is the aim of the further geometr - ization of physics . 
 this aim distinguishes from the aim of the conventional theory of elementary particles . 
 let us explain the difference of aims in the example of history the chemical elements investigation . 
 investigation of chemical elements reminds to some extent investigation of elementary particles . 
 chemical elements are investigated from two sides . 
 chemists systematized chemical elements , investigating their phenomenological properties . 
 the results of these investigations were formulated in the form of the periodical system of chemical elements in 1870 . 
 formulating this system , d.i.mendeleev conceived nothing about the atom construction 
 . nevertheless the periodical system appears to be very useful from the practical viewpoint . 
 physicists did not aim to explain the periodical system of chemical elements , they tried to understand simply the atom structure and the discrete character of atomic spectra . 
 after construction of the atomic theory it became clear , that the periodical system of chemical elements can be obtained and explained on the basis of the atomic theory . as a result 
 the `` physical '' approach to investigation of chemical elements appeared to be more fundamental , deep and promising , than the `` chemical '' one . on the other hand , 
 the way of the `` physical '' approach to explanation of the periodical system is very long and difficult . 
 explanation of the periodical system was hardly possible at the `` physical '' approach , i.e. without the intermediate aim ( construction of atomic structure ) . 
 thus , using geometrization of physics , we try to approach only intermediate aim : explanation of multivariance of particle motion ( quantum motion ) and capacity of discrimination of particle masses . 
 discrete character of masses of elementary particles can be understood , only if we understand the reason of the elementary particle discrimination . 
 contemporary approach to the elementary particle theory is the `` chemical '' ( phenomenological ) approach . 
 it is useful from the practical viewpoint . 
 however , it admits hardly to understand nature of elementary particles , because the nature of the discrimination mechanism , leading to discrete characteristics of elementary particle , remains outside the consideration . 
 the most general geometry is a physical geometry , which is called also the tubular geometry ( t - geometry ) @xcite , because straights in t - geometry are hallow tubes , in general . 
 the t - geometry is determined completely by its world function @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is interval between the points @xmath8 and @xmath9 in space - time , described by the t - geometry . 
 all concepts of t - geometry are expressed in terms of the world function @xmath0 . 
 dynamics of particles ( geometric dynamics ) is also described in terms of the world function . 
 the elementary particle is considered as an elementary geometrical object ( ego ) in the space - time . 
 the elementary geometrical object @xmath10 is described by its skeleton @xmath11 and its envelope @xmath12 . 
 the envelope @xmath12 is defined as a set of zeros of the envelope function @xmath13@xmath14the envelope function @xmath13 is a real function of arguments @xmath15 . 
 any argument @xmath16 @xmath17 is a world function @xmath18 , @xmath19 . 
 it is supposed that ego with skeleton @xmath20 is placed at the point @xmath5 .    in t - geometry 
 the vector @xmath21 is an ordered set of two points @xmath22 . 
 the length @xmath23 of the vector @xmath4 is defined via the world function by means of the relation@xmath24    the scalar product @xmath25 of two vectors @xmath4 and @xmath1 is defined by the relation@xmath26equivalence @xmath4eqv@xmath1 of two vectors @xmath4 and @xmath1 is defined as follows . 
 two vectors @xmath4 and @xmath1 are equivalent ( equal ) , if@xmath27 in the developed form we have@xmath28    skeletons @xmath20 and @xmath29 are equivalent ( @xmath30eqv@xmath31 , if corresponding vectors of both skeletons are equivalent@xmath32    the skeleton @xmath20 of ego at the point @xmath5 may exist as a skeleton of a physical body , if it may exist at any point @xmath33 of the space - time @xmath34 . 
 it means that there is a solution for system of equations @xmath35for any point @xmath33 . 
 further for brevity we take , that an existence of a skeleton means an existence of corresponding geometrical object .    in the space - time of minkowski the problem of the skeleton existence is rather simple , because at given @xmath30 and @xmath3 the system ( [ c1.6 ] ) of @xmath36 algebraic equations has a unique solution , although the number of equations may distinguish from the number of variables to be determined . 
 indeed , in the four - dimensional space - time the number of coordinates of @xmath37 points @xmath38 is equal to @xmath39 ( the point @xmath3 is supposed to be given ) . if @xmath40 the number @xmath36 of equations is larger than the number ( @xmath39 ) of variables . in the case of an arbitrary space - time geometry ( arbitrary world function @xmath0 ) 
 existence of solution of the system ( [ c1.6 ] ) is problematic , and the question of existence of the skeleton as a skeleton of a physical body is an essential problem . on the contrary , 
 if @xmath41 , the number of coordinates to be determined is less , than the number of equations , and one may have many skeletons @xmath42placed at the point @xmath3 , which are equivalent to skeleton @xmath30 , but they are not equivalent between themselves . 
 this property is a property of multivariance of the space - time geometry . 
 this property is actual for simple skeletons , which contain less , than four points ( @xmath41 ) . 
 for instance , for the skeleton of two points @xmath43 , which is described by the vector @xmath4 , the problem of multivariance is actual . in the space - time of minkowski 
 the equivalence of two vectors ( @xmath44 ) is single - variant for the timelike vectors , however it is multivariant for spacelike vectors . in the general space - time 
 the equivalence relation @xmath44 is multivariant for both timelike and spacelike vectors . 
 the problem of multivariance is essential for both existence and dynamics of elementary geometrical objects ( elementary particles ) . 
 let us formulate dynamics of elementary particles in the coordinateless form . 
 dynamics of an elementary particle , having skeleton @xmath11 , is described by the world chain @xmath45direction of evolution in the space - time is described by the leading vector @xmath4 . if the motion of the elementary particle is free , the adjacent links @xmath46 and @xmath47 are equivalent in the sense that @xmath48    relations ( [ c1.7 ] ) - ( [ c1.9 ] ) realizes coordinateless description of the free elementary particle motion . in the simplest case , 
 when the space - time is the space - time of minkowski , and the skeleton consists of two points @xmath49 with timelike leading vector @xmath4 , the coordinateless description by means of relations ( [ c1.7 ] ) - ( [ c1.9 ] ) coincides with the conventional description . 
 the conventional classical dynamics is well defined only in the riemannian space - time . the coordinateless dynamic description ( [ c1.7 ] ) - ( [ c1.9 ] ) of elementary particles is a generalization of the conventional classical dynamics onto the case of arbitrary space - time geometry . 
 any geometry is constructed as a modification of the proper euclidean geometry . 
 but not all representations of the proper euclidean geometry are convenient for modification . 
 there are three representation of the proper euclidean geometry @xcite . 
 they differ in the number of primary ( basic ) elements , forming the euclidean geometry . 
 the euclidean representation ( e - representation ) contains three basic elements ( point , segment , angle ) . 
 any geometrical object ( figure ) can be constructed of these basic elements . 
 properties of the basic elements and the method of their application are described by the euclidean axioms . 
 the vector representation ( v - representation ) of the proper euclidean geometry contains two basic elements ( point , vector ) . 
 the angle is a derivative element , which is constructed of two vectors . 
 a use of the two basic elements at the construction of geometrical objects is determined by the special structure , known as the linear vector space with the scalar product , given on it ( euclidean space ) . 
 the scalar product of linear vector space describes interrelation of two basic elements ( vectors ) , whereas other properties of the linear vector space associate with the displacement of vectors . 
 the third representation ( @xmath0-representation ) of the proper euclidean geometry contains only one basic element ( point ) . 
 segment ( vector ) is a derivative element . 
 it is constructed of points . 
 the angle is also a derivative element . 
 it is constructed of two segments ( vectors ) . 
 the @xmath50-representation contains a special structure : world function @xmath0 , which describes interrelation of two basic elements ( points ) . 
 the world function @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the distance between points @xmath5 and @xmath53 . 
 the concept of distance @xmath54 , as well as the world function @xmath0 , is used in all representations of the proper euclidean geometry . however , the world function forms a structure only in the @xmath0-representation , where the world function @xmath0 describes interrelation of two basic elements ( points ) . 
 besides , the world function satisfies a series of constraints , formulated in terms of @xmath0 and only in terms of @xmath0 . 
 these conditions ( the euclideaness conditions ) will be formulated below . 
 the euclideaness conditions are equivalent to a use of the vector linear space with the scalar product on it , but formally they do not mention the linear vector space , because all concepts of the linear vector space , as well as all concepts of the proper euclidean geometry are expressed directly via world function @xmath0 and only via it . 
 if we want to modify the proper euclidean geometry , then we should use the @xmath0-representation for its modification . in the @xmath0-representation the special geometric structure ( world function ) 
 has the form of a function of two points . modifying the form of the world function , we modify automatically all concepts of the proper euclidean geometry , which are expressed via the world function . 
 it is very important , that the expression of geometrical concepts via the world function does not refer to the means of description ( dimension , coordinate system , concept of a curve ) . 
 the fact , that modifying the world function , one violates the euclideaness conditions , is of no importance , because one obtains non - euclidean geometry as a result of such a modification . 
 a change of the world function means a change of the distance , which is interpreted as a deformation of the proper euclidean geometry . 
 the generalized geometry , obtained by a deformation of the proper euclidean geometry is called the tubular geometry ( t - geometry ) , because in the generalized geometry straight lines are tubes ( surfaces ) , in general , but not one - dimensional lines . 
 another name of t - geometry is the physical geometry . 
 the physical geometry is the geometry , described completely by the world function . 
 any physical geometry may be used as a space - time geometry in the sense , that the set of all t - geometries is the set of all possible space - time geometries . 
 modification of the proper euclidean geometry in v - representation is very restricted , because in this representation there are two basic elements . 
 they are not independent , and one can not modify them independently . 
 formally it means , that the linear vector space is to be preserved as a geometrical structure . 
 it means , in particular , that the generalized geometry retains to be continuous , uniform and isotropic . 
 the dimension of the generalized geometry is to be fixed . besides 
 , the generalized geometry , obtained by such a way , can not be multivariant . 
 such a property of the space - time geometry as multivariance can be obtained only in @xmath0-representation . 
 as far as the @xmath0-representation of the proper euclidean geometry was not known in the twentieth century , the multivariance of geometry was also unknown concept . 
 transition from the v - representation to @xmath0-representation is carried out as follows . 
 all concepts of the linear vector space are expressed in terms of the world function @xmath0 . in reality , 
 concepts of vector , scalar product of two vectors and linear dependence of @xmath37 vectors are expressed via the world function @xmath55 of the proper euclidean geometry . 
 such operations under vectors as equality of vectors , summation of vectors and multiplication of a vector by a real number are expressed by means of some formulae . 
 the characteristic properties of these operations , which are given in v - representation by means of axioms , are given now by special properties of the euclidean world function @xmath55 . 
 after expression of the linear vector space via the world function the linear vector space may be not mentioned , because all its properties are described by the world function . 
 we obtain the @xmath0-representation of the proper euclidean geometry , where some properties of the linear vector space are expressed in the form of formulae , whereas another part of properties is hidden in the specific form of the euclidean world function @xmath55 . modifying world function , we modify automatically the properties of the linear vector space ( which is not mentioned in fact ) . at such a modification 
 we are not to think about the way of modification of the linear vector space , which is the principal geometrical structure in the v - representation . in the @xmath0-representation the linear vector space is a derivative structure , which may be not mentioned at all . 
 thus , at transition to @xmath0-representation the concepts of the linear vector space ( primary concepts in v - representation ) become to be secondary concepts ( derivative concepts of the @xmath0-representation ) .    in @xmath0-representation 
 we have the following expressions for concepts of the proper euclidean geometry . 
 vector @xmath56 is an ordered set of two points @xmath8 and @xmath9 . 
 the length @xmath57 of the vector @xmath58 is defined by the relation@xmath59the scalar product @xmath25 of two vectors @xmath4 and @xmath1 is defined by the relation@xmath60where the world function @xmath0@xmath61is the world function @xmath55 of the euclidean geometry .    in the proper euclidean geometry 
 @xmath37 vectors @xmath62 , @xmath63 are linear dependent , if and only if the gram s determinant @xmath64 where the gram s determinant @xmath65 is defined by the relation @xmath66using expression ( [ a1.1 ] ) for the scalar product , the condition of the linear dependence of @xmath37 vectors @xmath62 , @xmath63 is written in the form@xmath67    definition ( [ a1.1 ] ) of the scalar product of two vectors coincides with the conventional scalar product of vectors in the proper euclidean space . 
 ( one can verify this easily ) . the relations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.7b ] ) do not contain a reference to the dimension of the euclidean space and to a coordinate system in it . hence , the relations ( [ a1.1 ] ) , ( [ a1.7b ] ) are general geometric relations , which may be considered as a definition of the scalar product of two vectors and that of the linear dependence of vectors . 
 equivalence ( equality ) of two vectors @xmath4 and @xmath1 is defined by the relations@xmath68where @xmath23 is the length ( [ a1.0 ] ) of the vector @xmath4@xmath69    in the developed form the condition ( [ a1.3 ] ) of equivalence of two vectors @xmath4 and @xmath1 has the form@xmath70    let the points @xmath49 , determining the vector @xmath4 , and the origin @xmath3 of the vector @xmath1 be given . 
 let @xmath4eqv@xmath1 . 
 we can determine the vector @xmath1 , solving two equations ( [ a1.5 ] ) , ( [ a1.6 ] ) with respect to the position of the point @xmath71 . 
 in the case of the proper euclidean space there is one and only one solution of equations ( [ a1.5 ] ) , ( [ a1.6 ] ) independently of the space dimension @xmath37 . in the case of arbitrary t - geometry 
 one can guarantee neither existence nor uniqueness of the solution of equations ( [ a1.5 ] ) , ( [ a1.6 ] ) for the point @xmath71 . 
 number of solutions depends on the form of the world function @xmath0 . 
 this fact means a multivariance of the property of two vectors equivalence in the arbitrary t - geometry . in other words , 
 the single - variance of the vector equality in the proper euclidean space is a specific property of the proper euclidean geometry , and this property is conditioned by the form of the euclidean world function . in other t - geometries 
 this property does not take place , in general . 
 the multivariance is a general property of a physical geometry . 
 it is connected with a necessity of solution of algebraic equations , containing the world function . as far as the world function is different in different physical geometries 
 , the solution of these equations may be not unique , or it may not exist at all .    if in the @xmath37-dimensional euclidean space @xmath72 , the vectors @xmath62 , @xmath63 are linear independent . 
 we may construct rectilinear coordinate system with basic vectors @xmath62 , @xmath63 in the @xmath37-dimensional euclidean space . 
 covariant coordinates @xmath73 of the vector @xmath74 in this coordinate system have the form@xmath75    now we can formulate the euclideaness conditions . 
 these conditions are conditions of the fact , that the t - geometry , described by the world function @xmath0 , is @xmath37-dimensional proper euclidean geometry . 
 i. definition of the dimension and introduction of the rectilinear coordinate system : @xmath76where @xmath77  is the gram s determinant ( a1.7 ) . 
 vectors @xmath78 , @xmath79  are basic vectors of the rectilinear coordinate system @xmath80  with the origin at the point @xmath5 . in @xmath80 
 the covariant metric tensor @xmath81 ,  @xmath82  and the contravariant one @xmath83 ,  @xmath82  are defined by the relations @xmath84@xmath85    \ii . 
 linear structure of the euclidean space : @xmath86where coordinates @xmath87  @xmath88  of the point @xmath8  are covariant coordinates of the vector @xmath74 , defined by the relation ( [ a1.8 ] ) . 
 iii : the metric tensor matrix @xmath89  has only positive eigenvalues 
 @xmath90    \iv . 
 the continuity condition : the system of equations @xmath91considered to be equations for determination of the point @xmath8  as a function of coordinates @xmath92 ,  @xmath88  has always one and only one solution . _ _  _ _ all conditions i @xmath93 iv contain a reference to the dimension @xmath37  of the euclidean space . 
 one can show that conditions i @xmath93 iv are the necessary and sufficient conditions of the fact that the set @xmath34 together with the world function @xmath0 , given on @xmath94 , describes the @xmath37-dimensional euclidean space @xcite . 
 investigation of the dirac particle ( dynamic system , described by the dirac equation ) has shown , that the dirac particle is a composite particle r2004 , whose internal degrees of freedom are described nonrelativistically @xcite . 
 the composite structure of the dirac particle may be explained as a relativistic rotator , consisting of two ( or more ) particles , rotating around their inertia centre . 
 the relativistic rotator explains existence of the dirac particle spin , however , the problem of the rotating particles confinement appears . in this paper 
 we try to explain the problem of spin in the framework of the program of the physics geometrization , when dynamics of physical bodies is determined by the space - time geometry . 
 although the first stages of the physics geometrization ( the special relativity and the general relativity ) manifest themselves very well , the papers on further geometrization of physics , which ignore the quantum principles , are considered usually as dissident . 
 dynamics in the space - time , described by a physical geometry ( t - geometry ) , is presented in @xcite . here 
 we remind the statement of the problem of dynamics . 
 geometrical object @xmath95 is a subset of points in the point set @xmath34 . in the t - geometry 
 the geometric object @xmath10 is described by means of the skeleton - envelope method . 
 it means that any geometric object @xmath10 is considered to be a set of intersections and joins of elementary geometric objects ( ego ) .    the elementary geometrical object @xmath12 is described by its skeleton @xmath30 and envelope function @xmath13 . 
 the finite set @xmath96 of parameters of the envelope function @xmath13 is the skeleton of elementary geometric object ( ego ) @xmath97 . 
 the set @xmath97 of points forming ego is called the envelope of its skeleton @xmath30 . 
 the envelope function @xmath13@xmath98determining ego is a function of the running point @xmath99 and of parameters @xmath100 . 
 the envelope function @xmath13 is supposed to be an algebraic function of @xmath101 arguments @xmath15 , @xmath102 . 
 each of arguments @xmath103 is the world function @xmath0 of two points @xmath104 , either belonging to skeleton @xmath30 , or coinciding with the running point @xmath105 . 
 thus , any elementary geometric object @xmath12 is determined by its skeleton @xmath30 and its envelope function @xmath13 . 
 elementary geometric object @xmath12 is the set of zeros of the envelope function @xmath106__definition . 
 _ _ two egos @xmath107 and @xmath108 are equivalent , if their skeletons @xmath30 and @xmath109 are equivalent and their envelope functions @xmath13 and @xmath110 are equivalent . 
 equivalence ( @xmath30eqv@xmath109 ) of two skeletons @xmath111 and @xmath112 means that @xmath113equivalence of the envelope functions @xmath13 and @xmath110 means , that they have the same set of zeros . 
 it means that @xmath114where @xmath115 is an arbitrary function , having the property@xmath116    evolution of ego @xmath117 in the space - time is described as a world chain @xmath118 of equivalent connected egos . 
 the point @xmath5 of the skeleton @xmath11 is considered to be the origin of the geometrical object @xmath119 the ego @xmath117 is considered to be placed at its origin @xmath5 . 
 let us consider a set of equivalent skeletons @xmath120 @xmath121which are equivalent in pairs @xmath122the skeletons @xmath123 @xmath121are connected , and they form a chain in the direction of vector @xmath4 , if the point @xmath53 of one skeleton coincides with the origin @xmath5 of the adjacent skeleton @xmath124the chain @xmath118 describes evolution of the elementary geometrical object @xmath117 in the direction of the leading vector @xmath4 . the evolution of ego @xmath117 is a temporal evolution , if the vectors @xmath125 are timelike @xmath126 @xmath127 . 
 the evolution of ego @xmath117 is a spatial evolution , if the vectors @xmath125 are spacelike @xmath128 @xmath127 . 
 note , that all adjacent links ( egos ) of the chain are equivalent in pairs , although two links of the chain may be not equivalent , if they are not adjacent . 
 however , lengths of corresponding vectors are equal in all links of the chain @xmath129we shall refer to the vector @xmath125 , which determines the form of the evolution and the shape of the world chain , as the leading vector . 
 this vector determines the direction of 4-velocity of the physical body , associated with the link of the world chain . 
 if the relations@xmath130@xmath131are satisfied , the relations@xmath132are not satisfied , in general , because the relations ( [ a6.11 ] ) contain the scalar products @xmath133 . 
 these scalar products contain the world functions @xmath134 , which are not contained in relations ( [ a6.9 ] ) , ( [ a6.10 ] ) . 
 the world chain @xmath118 , consisting of equivalent links ( [ a6.1 ] ) , ( [ a6.2 ] ) , describes a free motion of a physical body ( particle ) , associated with the skeleton @xmath30 . 
 we assume that _ the motion of physical body is free , if all points of the body move free _ ( i.e. without acceleration ) . if the external forces are absent , the physical body as a whole moves without acceleration . 
 however , if the body rotates , one may not consider a motion of this body as a free motion , because not all points of this body move free ( without acceleration ) . in the rotating body 
 there are internal forces , which generate centripetal acceleration of some points of the body . as a result 
 some points of the body do not move free . 
 motion of the rotating body may be free only on the average , but not exactly free . 
 conception of non - free motion of a particle is rather indefinite , and we restrict ourselves with consideration of a free motion only 
 .    conventional conception of the motion of extensive ( non - pointlike ) particle , which is free on the average , contains a free displacement , described by the velocity 4-vector , and a spatial rotation , described by the angular velocity 3-pseudovector @xmath135 . 
 the velocity 4-vector is associated with the timelike leading vector @xmath4 . at the free on the average motion of a rotating body some of vectors @xmath136 ... of the skeleton @xmath30 are not in parallel with vectors @xmath137 , although at the free motion all vectors @xmath138 are to be in parallel with @xmath137 as follows from ( [ a6.1 ] ) . 
 it means that the world chain @xmath118 of a freely moving body can describe only translation of a physical body , but not its rotation . 
 if the leading vector @xmath4 is spacelike , the body , described by the skeleton @xmath30 , evolves in the spacelike direction . 
 it seems , that the spacelike evolution is prohibited . 
 but it is not so . 
 if the world chain forms a helix with the timelike axis , such a world chain may be considered as timelike on the average . in reality 
 such world chains are possible . for instance , the world chain of the classical dirac particle is a helix with timelike axis . 
 it is not quite clear , whether or not the links of this chain are spacelike , because internal degrees of freedom of the dirac particle , responsible for helicity of the world chain , are described nonrelativistically . 
 thus , consideration of a spatial evolution is not meaningless , especially if we take into account , that the spatial evolution may imitate rotation , which is absent at the free motion of a particle . 
 further we consider the problem of the spatial evolution . 
 dirac particle @xmath139 is the dynamic system , described by the dirac equation . 
 the free dirac particle @xmath139 is described by the free dirac equation @xmath140where @xmath141 is the four - component complex wave function , and @xmath142 , @xmath143 are @xmath144 complex matrices , satisfying the relations@xmath145@xmath146 is the @xmath144 unit matrix , @xmath147 is the metric tensor . 
 expressions of physical quantities : the 4-flux @xmath148 of particles and the energy - momentum tensor @xmath149 have the form@xmath150where @xmath151 , @xmath152 is the hermitian conjugate to @xmath141 . 
 the classical dirac particle is a dynamic system @xmath153 , which is obtained from the dynamic system @xmath139 in the classical limit .    to obtain the classical limit 
 , one may not set the quantum constant @xmath154 in the equation ( [ f1.2 ] ) , because in this case we do not obtain any reasonable description of the particle . 
 the dirac particle @xmath139 is a quantum particle in the sense , that it is described by a system of partial differential equations ( pde ) , which contain the quantum constant @xmath155 . 
 the classical dirac particle @xmath153 is described by a system of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) , which contain the quantum constant @xmath155 as a parameter . 
 may the system of ode carry out the classical description , if it contains the quantum constant @xmath155 ? 
 the answer depends on the viewpoint of investigator . 
 if the investigator believes that _ the quantum constant is an attribute of quantum principles and only of quantum principles _ , he supposes that , containing @xmath155 , the dynamic equations can not realize a classical description , where the quantum principles are not used . 
 however , if the investigator consider the classical description simply as method of investigation of the quantum dynamic equations , it is of no importance , whether or not the system of ode contains the quantum constant . 
 it is important only , that the system of pde is approximated by a system of ode . 
 the dynamic system , described by pde , contains infinite number of the freedom degrees . 
 the dynamic system , described by ode , contains several degrees of freedom . 
 it is simpler and can be investigated more effectively .    obtaining the classical approximation 
 , we use the procedure of dynamic disquantization @xcite . 
 this procedure transforms the system of pde into the system of ode . 
 the procedure of dynamic disquantization is a dynamical procedure , which has no relation to the process of quantization or disquantization in the sense , that it does not refer to the quantum principles . 
 the dynamic disquantization means that all derivatives @xmath156 in dynamic equations are replaced by the projection of vector @xmath157 onto the current vector @xmath148 @xmath158this dynamical operation is called the dynamic disquantization , because , applying it to the schrdinger equation , we obtain the dynamic equations for the statistical ensemble of classical nonrelativistic particles . 
 these dynamic equations are ode , which do not depend on the quantum constant @xmath155 .    applying the operation ( [ b3.1 ] ) , to the dirac equation ( [ f1.2 ] ) , 
 we transform it to the form@xmath159the equation ( [ b3.2 ] ) is the dynamic equation for the dynamic system system @xmath160 . 
 the equation ( [ b3.2 ] ) contains only derivative @xmath161 in the direction of the current 4-vector @xmath148 . in terms of the wave function 
 @xmath141 the dynamic equation ( [ b3.2 ] ) for @xmath160 looks rather bulky . however , in the properly chosen variables the action for the dynamic system @xmath160 has the form @xcite @xmath162=\int \left\ { -\kappa _ { 0}m\sqrt{\dot{x}^{i}\dot{x}_{i}}+\hbar { \frac{(\dot{\mathbf{\xi } } \times \mathbf{\xi } ) \mathbf{z}}{2(1+\mathbf{\xi z})}}+\hbar \frac{(\dot{\mathbf{x}}\times \ddot{\mathbf{x}})\mathbf{\xi } } { 2\sqrt{\dot{x}^{s}\dot{x}_{s}}(\sqrt{\dot{x}^{s}\dot{x}_{s}}+\dot{x}^{0})}\right\ } d^{4}\tau   \label{a5.18}\]]where the dot means the total derivative @xmath163 . 
 the quantities @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 are considered to be functions of the lagrangian coordinates @xmath168 , @xmath169 . 
 the variables @xmath170 describe position of the dirac particle . 
 here and in what follows the symbol @xmath171 means the vector product of two 3-vectors . 
 the quantity@xmath172 is the constant unit 3-vector , @xmath173 is a dichotomic quantity @xmath174 , @xmath175 is the constant ( mass ) taken from the dirac equation ( [ f1.2 ] ) . 
 in fact , variables @xmath170 depend on @xmath176 as on parameters , because the action ( [ a5.18 ] ) does not contain derivatives with respect to @xmath177 ,  @xmath167 . 
 lagrangian density of the action ( [ a5.18 ] ) does not contain independent variables @xmath178 explicitly . 
 hence , it may be written in the form @xmath162=\int \mathcal{a}_{\mathrm{dcl}}[x,\mathbf{\xi } ] d\mathbf{\tau , \qquad } d\mathbf{\tau } = d\tau _ { 1}d\tau _ { 2}d\tau _ { 3 }   \label{b3.8}\]]where @xmath179=\int \left\ { -\kappa _ { 0}m\sqrt{\dot{x}^{i}\dot{x}_{i}}+\hbar { \frac{(\dot{\mathbf{\xi } } \times \mathbf{\xi } ) \mathbf{z}}{2(1+\mathbf{\xi z})}}+\hbar   \frac{(\dot{\mathbf{x}}\times \ddot{\mathbf{x}})\mathbf{\xi } } { 2\sqrt{\dot{x}^{s}\dot{x}_{s}}(\sqrt{\dot{x}^{s}\dot{x}_{s}}+\dot{x}^{0})}\right\ } d\tau _ { 0 }   \label{b3.9}\ ] ]    the action ( [ b3.8 ] ) is the action for the dynamic system @xmath160 , which is a set of similar independent dynamic systems @xmath153 . such a dynamic system is called a statistical ensemble . dynamic systems @xmath153 are elements ( constituents ) of the statistical ensemble @xmath160 . 
 dynamic equations for each @xmath153 form a system of ordinary differential equations . 
 it may be interpreted in the sense , that the dynamic system @xmath153 may be considered to be a classical one , although lagrangian of @xmath153 contains the quantum constant @xmath155 . 
 the dynamic system @xmath180 will be referred to as the classical dirac particle .    the dynamic system @xmath153 has ten degrees of freedom . 
 it describes a composite particle @xcite . 
 external degrees of freedom are described relativistically by variables @xmath170 . 
 internal degrees of freedom are described nonrelativistically @xcite by variables @xmath181 . 
 solution of dynamic equations , generated by the action ( [ b3.9 ] ) , gives the following result @xcite . in the coordinate system , where the canonical momentum four - vector @xmath182 has the form @xmath183the world line of the classical dirac particle is a helix , which is described by the relation @xmath184where the speed of the light @xmath185 , and @xmath186 is an arbitrary constant ( lorentz factor of the classical dirac particle ) . 
 the velocity @xmath187 of the classical dirac particle is expressed as follows @xmath188    helical world line of the classical dirac particle means a rotation of the particle around some point . on the one hand , 
 such a rotation seems to be reasonable , because it explains freely the dirac particle spin and magnetic moment . on the other hand , 
 the description of this rotation is nonrelativistic . 
 besides , it seems rather strange , that the world line of a free classical particle is a helix , but not a straight line . 
 attempt of consideration of the dirac particle as a rotator , consisting of two particles @xcite , meets the problem of confinement of the two particles . 
 although the pure dynamical methods of investigation are more general and effective , than the investigation methods , based on quantum principles , the purely dynamical methods of investigation meet incomprehension of most investigators , who believe , that the dirac particle must be investigated by quantum methods . the papers , devoted to investigation of the dirac equation by the dynamic methods , are considered as dissident . 
 they are rejected by the peer review journals ( see discussion in @xcite ) . 
 suddenly it is discovered that the helical world line , which is characteristic for the classical dirac particle , can be obtained as a result of a spatial evolution of geometric objects in the framework of properly chosen space - time geometry . 
 let us consider the flat homogeneous isotropic space - time @xmath189 , described by the world function @xmath190@xmath191@xmath192where @xmath193 is the world function of the @xmath194-dimensional space - time of minkowski . 
 @xmath195 is some elementary length . 
 in such a space - time geometry two connected equivalent timelike vectors @xmath4 and @xmath196 are described as follows @xcite @xmath197where @xmath198 is an arbitrary unit 3-vector . 
 the quantity @xmath199 is the length of the vector @xmath4 ( geometrical mass , associated with the particle , which is described by the vector @xmath4 ) . 
 we see that the spatial part of the vector @xmath196 is determined to within the arbitrary 3-vector of the length @xmath200 . 
 this multivariance generates wobbling of the links of the world chain , consisting of equivalent timelike vectors @xmath201 , @xmath196 , @xmath202 , ... statistical description of the chain with wobbling links coincides with the quantum description of the particle with the mass @xmath203 , if the elementary length @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the speed of the light , @xmath155 is the quantum constant , and @xmath206 is some universal constant , whose exact value is not determined @xcite , because the statistical description does not contain the quantity @xmath206 . 
 thus , the characteristic wobbling length is of the order of @xmath195 .    to explain the quantum description of the particle motion as a statistical description of the multivariant classical motion , we should use the world function ( [ a4.1 ] ) 
 however , the form of the world function ( [ a4.1 ] ) is determined by the coincidence of the two descriptions only for the value @xmath207 , where the constant @xmath208 is determined via the mass @xmath209 of the lightest massive particle ( electron ) by means of the relation @xmath210where @xmath211 is the geometrical mass of the lightest massive particle ( electron ) . 
 the geometrical mass @xmath212 of the same particle , considered in the space - time geometry of minkowski , has the form@xmath213as far as @xmath214 , and , hence , @xmath215 , we obtain the following estimation for the universal constant @xmath206@xmath216    intensity of wobbling may be described by the multivariance vector @xmath217 , which is defined as follows . 
 let @xmath196 , @xmath218 be two vectors which are equivalent to the vector @xmath219 . 
 let @xmath220let us consider the vector @xmath221which is a difference of vectors @xmath196 , @xmath218 . 
 we consider the length @xmath222 of the vector @xmath223 in the minkowski space - time . 
 we obtain@xmath224the length of the vector ( [ a4.3a ] ) is minimal at @xmath225 . at @xmath226 
 the length of the vector ( [ a4.3a ] ) is maximal , and it is equal to zero . by definition 
 the vector @xmath223 at @xmath225 is the multivariance 4-vector @xmath217 , which describes the intensity of the multivariance . 
 we have @xmath227where @xmath198 is an arbitrary unit 3-vector . 
 the multivariance vector @xmath217 is spacelike    in the case , when @xmath228 , the corresponding wobbling length @xmath229where @xmath230 is the electron compton wave length . 
 the relation ( [ a4.3 ] ) means that @xmath231for other values @xmath232 the form of the world function @xmath233 may distinguish from the relation ( [ a4.4 ] ) . 
 however , @xmath234 , if @xmath235 . 
 two equivalent connected spacelike vectors @xmath1 , @xmath236 have the form @xcite@xmath237where constants @xmath238 and @xmath239 are arbitrary . the result is obtained for the space - time geometry ( [ a4.0 ] ) . 
 arbitrariness of constants @xmath240 generates multivariance of the vector @xmath236 even in the space - time geometry of minkowski , where @xmath241 . 
 vectors @xmath236 , @xmath242 @xmath243are equivalent to the vector @xmath1 . the difference @xmath244 of two vectors @xmath236 , @xmath242 has the form@xmath245the vector @xmath244 may be spacelike and timelike 
 . its length has an extremum , if @xmath246 and @xmath247 . in this case the length @xmath248    however , the length@xmath249has neither maximum , nor minimum , and one can not introduce the multivariance vector of the type ( [ a4.3c ] ) . 
 the multivariance of the spacelike vectors equality is not introduced by the distortion @xmath250 , defined by ( [ a4.0a ] ) . 
 it takes place already in the space - time of minkowski . in the conventional approach to the geometry of minkowski one 
 does not accept the multivariance of spacelike vectors equivalence . 
 furthermore , the concept of multivariance of two vectors parallelism ( and equality ) is absent at all in the conventional approach to the geometry . 
 for instance , when in the riemannian geometry the multivariance of parallelism of remote vectors appears , the mathematicians prefer to deny at all the fernparallelism ( parallelism of two remote vectors ) , but not to introduce the concept of multivariance . 
 this circumstance is connected with the fact , that the multivariance may not appear , if the geometry is constructed on the basis of a system of axioms . 
 the world chain , consisting of timelike equivalent vectors , imitates a world line of a free particle . 
 this fact seems to be rather reasonable . 
 considering the vectors @xmath1 and @xmath236 in ( [ a6.50 ] ) from the viewpoint of the geometry of minkowski , we see that the vector @xmath236 is obtained from the vector @xmath1 as a result of spatial rotation and of an addition of some temporal component . 
 one should expect , that the world chain , consisting of spacelike equivalent vectors , imitates a world line of a free particle , moving with a superluminal velocity . 
 the motion with the superluminal velocity seems to be unobservable . 
 such a motion is considered to be impossible . however , if the spacelike world line has a shape of a helix with timelike axis , such a situation may be considered as a free rotating particle . 
 the fact , that the particle rotates with the superluminal velocity is not so important , if the helix axis is timelike . 
 the world line of a classical dirac particle is a helix . 
 it is not very important , whether the rotation velocity is tardyon or not . 
 especially , if we take into account that the dirac equation describes the internal degrees of freedom ( rotation ) nonrelativistically , ( i.e. the description of internal degrees of the classical dirac particle is incorrect from the viewpoint of the relativity theory ) . 
 we investigate now , whether a world chain of equivalent spacelike vectors may form a helix with timelike axis . 
 if it is possible , then we try to investigate , under which world function such a situation is possible . 
 we consider the world function @xmath233 of the form @xmath251where the function @xmath252 should be determined from the condition , that the world chain , consisting of spacelike links , forms a helix with timelike axis . 
 to estimate the form of @xmath233 as a function of @xmath193 at @xmath232 , we consider the chain , consisting of equivalent spacelike vectors ... @xmath4 , @xmath196 , @xmath253 ... we suppose that the chain is a helix with timelike axis in the space - time . 
 let the points @xmath254 . have the coordinates@xmath255all points ( [ a4.6 ] ) lie on a helix with timelike axis . 
 in the space - time of minkowski the step of helix is equal to @xmath256 , and @xmath105 is the radius of the helix . 
 the constants @xmath257 and @xmath258 are parameters of the helix . 
 all vectors @xmath259 have the same length . 
 introducing designations [ 02beg]@xmath260we obtain coordinates of vectors @xmath259 in the form @xmath261where @xmath262 are parameters of the helix . 
 let us investigate , under which conditions the relation @xmath263eqv@xmath259 takes place . 
 we suppose that all vectors of the helix are spacelike @xmath264 . 
 it is evident , that it is sufficient to investigate the situation for the case @xmath265 , when @xmath4eqv@xmath196 . 
 let coordinates of vectors @xmath4 , @xmath196 be @xmath266 in this case the coordinates of the points @xmath267 may be chosen in the form@xmath268and the vector @xmath219 has coordinates @xmath269we choose the world function ( [ a4.5 ] ) in the form@xmath270and introduce the quantity @xmath271    thus , we have @xmath272the space - time geometry ( [ a4.15 ] ) is a special case of the space - time geometry ( [ a4.4 ] ) . 
 we do not pretend to the claim , that ( [ a4.15 ] ) is the world function of true space - time geometry . 
 we shall show only that in the space - time geometry ( [ a4.15 ] ) the spacelike vectors ( [ a4.9 ] ) may be equivalent at some proper choice of parameters @xmath273 , @xmath274 and @xmath257 .    in our calculations we shall use two geometries : the geometry @xmath275 of minkowski and the space - time geometry @xmath276 , described by the world function @xmath233 , determined by ( [ a4.15 ] ) . 
 then expressions of the geometry @xmath276 may be reduced to expressions of the geometry @xmath275 by means of relations@xmath277@xmath278@xmath279the geometrical relations in @xmath276 are expressed via the same relations , written in @xmath275 with additional terms , containing the distortion @xmath250 . 
 this additional terms in dynamic relations are interpreted as additional metric interactions , acting on a particle , when the real space - time geometry @xmath276 is considered to be the geometry @xmath275 . 
 appearance of additional interactions reminds appearance of inertial forces at a use of accelerated coordinate systems instead of inertial ones . 
 condition @xmath4eqv@xmath196 of equivalence of vectors @xmath4 , @xmath196 is written in the form of two equations@xmath280@xmath281where index m means , that the corresponding quantities are calculated in @xmath275 . 
 the function @xmath250 is determined by the relation ( [ a4.15 ] ) , and the quantity @xmath282 is determined by the relation @xmath283which follows from the definition of the scalar product ( [ a4.15c ] ) . using the conventional relations for the scalar product in @xmath275 , we can rewrite the relations ( [ a4.16 ] ) , ( [ a4.17 ] ) in the form @xmath284@xmath285where@xmath286    to obtain the relation ( [ a4.21 ] ) from ( [ a4.18 ] ) , we use the relations@xmath287@xmath288the equation ( [ a4.20 ] ) is the identity . 
 let us introduce pure quantities 
 @xmath289 , @xmath290 , defining them by relations@xmath291@xmath292then the equation ( [ a4.19 ] ) takes the form@xmath293where the function @xmath294 is defined by the relation ( [ a4.15])@xmath295and the constant @xmath296 is defined by the relation ( [ a4.14a ] ) . 
 let us note , that in the case , when @xmath297 is a linear function @xmath298 , for @xmath299 $ ] , the equation ( [ a4.25a ] ) has the unique solution @xmath300 . 
 the solution with @xmath301 describes a straight but not a helix . 
 considering solutions of equation ( [ a4.25a ] ) with respect to @xmath302 , we are interested in positive values of @xmath290 , because the quantity @xmath290 is nonnegative by definition ( [ a4.25 ] ) . at @xmath303 numerical solutions of equation ( [ a4.25a ] ) with respect to @xmath290 
 are presented in the form@xmath304    according to ( [ a4.7 ] ) , ( [ a4.24 ] ) and ( [ a4.25 ] ) we have the following relations for the helix radius @xmath105 @xmath305we obtain the helix step @xmath306 in the form@xmath307    negative values of @xmath289 correspond to helix with timelike vectors @xmath263 . 
 positive solutions of equation ( [ a4.25a ] ) take place only for @xmath308 ( spacelike vectors ) and @xmath309 ( timelike vectors ) . 
 the values of parameter @xmath310 belong to intervals    @xmath311 , \qquad a\in \left ( 0,3\right )   \label{a4.38}\ ] ]    for spacelike and timelike vectors correspondingly . 
 thus , we see that in the space - time geometry with the world function ( a4.15 ) the spatial evolution , determined by the spacelike vectors @xmath259 , may lead to a helical world chain with timelike axis . 
 however , equivalence of spacelike vectors @xmath259 is multivariant even in the space - time of minkowski . 
 it is valid for the space - time geometry ( [ a4.15 ] ) also . as a result 
 the wobbling of the spacelike vectors appears . 
 it may lead to destruction of the helix .    in reality the conditions @xmath312 determines vector @xmath313to within the vector @xmath314 , and we have instead of equations ( [ a4.9 ] ) @xmath315where @xmath316 , @xmath317 , @xmath318 are 4-vectors with coordinates@xmath319    instead of equations ( [ a4.19 ] )  ( [ a4.21 ] ) we have the following equations@xmath320@xmath321where @xmath322 and @xmath323 mean scalar products of vectors @xmath324 in the space - time of minkowski . the relation ( [ a4.25a ] ) is the necessary condition of the fact , that @xmath325 is a solution of equations ( [ a4.41 ] ) , ( [ a4.42 ] ) . 
 we obtain from ( [ a4.41 ] ) @xmath326where @xmath327 means the scalar product of 3-vectors @xmath328 and @xmath329 . 
 taking into account the relation ( [ a4.25a ] ) , we obtain from relation ( [ a4.42 ] ) @xmath330supposing , that @xmath322 is a small quantity we obtain from ( [ a4.44 ] ) by means of ( [ a4.43])@xmath331    the relation ( [ a4.45 ] ) may be transformed to the equation@xmath332where@xmath333as far as @xmath334 , we obtain , that @xmath335 , and the surface ( [ a4.46 ] ) is a hyperboloid in the 3-space of quantities @xmath336 . 
 it means that solutions of the equations ( [ a4.43 ] ) , ( [ a4.44 ] ) may deflect arbitrarily far from the helix solution ( [ a4.9 ] ) . 
 this deflection is a manifestation of the multivariance of the space - time geometry . 
 suppression of multivariance and stabilization of the world chain , consisting of spacelike vectors , can be achieved , if we consider the world chain with composed links , whose skeleton consists of three points @xmath337 , @xmath338 ( see figure 1 ) . 
 let @xmath259 be a spacelike vector , whereas the vector @xmath339 be a timelike vector in @xmath275 . to investigate the effect of stabilization , it is sufficient to consider the points @xmath340 , having coordinates@xmath341the following vectors 
 are associated with these points of the skeletons@xmath342where the quantities @xmath343 are the given 4-vectors , whereas the quantities @xmath344 are 4-vectors , which are to be determined from the condition @xmath345    expressions for 4-vectors @xmath317 and @xmath54 are chosen in such a way , that vectors @xmath196 and @xmath346 ( at @xmath347 ) were a result of rotation of vectors @xmath4 and @xmath348 in the plane @xmath349 by the angle @xmath350 . 
 the quantities @xmath351are supposed to be given . the 4-vectors @xmath352are to be determined from the relations ( [ a5.3a ] ) .    the 4-vectors @xmath316 and @xmath317 coincide with vectors ( [ a4.9 ] ) . 
 we are interested in the following question , whether the stabilizing vector @xmath353 can be chosen in such a way , that equations ( [ a5.3a ] ) have the unique solution @xmath347 . 
 if such a stabilizing vector @xmath354exists , the world chain will have a shape of a helix without wobbling . 
 it may be , that the complete stabilization is impossible . 
 then , maybe , a partial stabilization is possible , when the quantities @xmath318 , @xmath355 are small , although they do not vanish . in any case 
 the problem of the stabilizing vector existence is a pure mathematical problem .    solving this problem 
 , we shall use relations ( [ a4.15a ] ) , ( [ a4.15b ] ) to reduce all geometrical relations to the geometrical relations in the space - time of minkowski . 
 working in the space - time of minkowski , we shall use the conventional covariant formalism , where the expressions of the type @xmath356 and @xmath357 mean@xmath358index "" will be omitted for brevity . 
 it follows from the condition @xmath4eqv@xmath196@xmath359where@xmath360after transformations we obtain@xmath361@xmath362these equations coincide with ( [ a4.41 ] ) , ( [ a4.42 ] ) . if @xmath363 the equations ( [ b5.11 ] ) , ( [ b5.12 ] ) coincide with ( [ a4.20 ] ) , ( a4.25a ) respectively . 
 we obtain from the condition @xmath348eqv@xmath346@xmath364@xmath365where@xmath366    the equations ( [ b5.14 ] ) and ( [ b5.15 ] ) are transformed to the form@xmath367@xmath368@xmath369    let us suppose that the stabilizing vector @xmath101 is long in the sense that @xmath370then in ( [ b5.17 ] ) the functions @xmath250 , which contains @xmath101 in its argument will be equal to @xmath371 and all terms , containing @xmath101 compensate each other . 
 the necessary condition of the fact , that @xmath372 is a solution of equations ( [ b5.16 ] ) , ( [ b5.17 ] ) , has the form@xmath373@xmath374the equation ( [ b5.18 ] ) is satisfied identically by the choice ( b5.4a ) , ( [ b5.4b ] ) of vectors @xmath101 and @xmath54 . 
 we obtain from the condition @xmath375eqv@xmath376@xmath377@xmath378@xmath379@xmath380    the necessary conditions of the fact , that @xmath381 is a solution of equations ( [ b5.23 ] ) , ( [ b5.24 ] ) , have the form@xmath382@xmath383    the equation ( [ b5.27 ] ) is satisfied identically by the relations ( b5.4a ) , ( [ b5.4b ] ) . 
 the difference of equations ( [ b5.19 ] ) and ( b5.28 ) leads to the equation    @xmath384    let us substitute expressions for @xmath385 , determined by the relations ( [ b5.4a ] ) , ( [ b5.4b ] ) , in ( [ b5.29 ] ) . 
 after transformations we obtain the connection between the quantities @xmath386 and @xmath387 in the form@xmath388    the equation ( [ b5.19 ] ) by means of ( [ b5.30 ] ) is reduced to the form@xmath389where according to ( [ a4.15 ] ) the function @xmath390 is substituted by @xmath391 .    setting @xmath392and using designations ( [ a4.24 ] ) , ( [ a4.25 ] ) , we transform the equation ( [ b5.31 ] ) to the form @xmath393    the equations ( [ a4.25a ] ) and ( [ b5.33 ] ) form a system of two necessary conditions , imposed on parmeters of the helical world chain . 
 each link of the chain consists of two vectors : leading vector @xmath394 and stabilizing vector @xmath395 . 
 parameter @xmath396 is determined by the space - time geometry . 
 the quantity @xmath397 describes the length of the spacelike leading vector @xmath394 . 
 parameter @xmath398 describes the length of the projection of the leading vector @xmath394 on the plane of rotation . 
 finally , @xmath399 describes the angle @xmath350 of rotation of the leading vector in the plane of rotation . 
 numerical solutions of equations ( [ a4.25a ] ) and ( [ b5.33 ] ) are presented for the parameter @xmath303 
 solutions of equations , which describe the necessary conditions of the fact , that the world chain may be a helix , are not unique 
 . there may be solutions of ( [ a5.3a ] ) , described by nonvanishing @xmath318 and @xmath355 , which generate wobbling and violate the helical character of world chain . 
 we write six equation ( [ a5.3a ] ) as equation for @xmath401 with parameters @xmath343 , satisfying the necessary conditions ( [ a4.25a ] ) and ( b5.33 ) . 
 we obtain instead of equations ( [ b5.11 ] ) , ( [ b5.12 ] ) the following two equations@xmath402@xmath403where the quantities @xmath404 satisfy the necessary conditions ( [ b5.33 ] ) ( [ a4.25a ] ) , and @xmath405 is a derivative of the function ( [ a4.26 ] ) , which is always nonnegative 
 . then it follows from ( [ b6.2 ] ) @xmath406    equations ( [ b6.1 ] ) , ( [ b6.3 ] ) contain only the variable @xmath318 ( but not @xmath355 ) and coincide with the equations ( [ a4.41 ] ) , ( a4.42 ) . however , there are additional constraints , containing @xmath318 . as a result the constraints on @xmath318 distinguish from the relation ( a4.46 ) , describing values of @xmath318 without the stabilizing vector @xmath395 .    in the developed 
 form the relations ( [ b5.16 ] ) , ( [ b5.17 ] ) have the form @xmath407@xmath408they contain only the variable @xmath355 ( but not @xmath318 )    finally the relations ( [ b5.23 ] ) , ( [ b5.24 ] ) in the developed form can be written as follows@xmath409@xmath410the relation ( [ b6.7 ] ) is a linear combination of equations ( [ b5.17 ] ) and ( [ b5.24 ] ) , which does not contain the function @xmath294 . relations ( b6.6 ) and ( [ b6.7 ] ) contain both quantities @xmath401 and @xmath411 . the constraints ( [ b6.6 ] ) and ( [ b6.7 ] ) 
 modify the constraints ( [ a4.46 ] ) , transforming the hyperboloid into ellipsoid . 
 we suppose for simplicity , that the vector @xmath395 is very long ( @xmath412 ) . 
 we suppose , that @xmath413 . in this case 
 we obtain from the relation ( [ b6.5 ] ) , that @xmath414 . 
 it follows from ( [ b6.7 ] ) , that @xmath415 . 
 besides , it follows from ( [ b6.3 ] ) , that @xmath416 . 
 thus , solutions of the equations ( [ b6.5 ] ) , ( [ b6.7 ] ) and ( [ b6.3 ] ) have the form @xmath417    at the constraints ( [ b6.8 ] ) three other equations ( [ b6.1 ] ) , ( b6.4 ) and ( [ b6.6 ] ) take the form @xmath418@xmath419@xmath420solution of equation ( [ b6.9 ] ) has the form @xmath421where @xmath422 is an arbitrary angle . 
 solution of equation ( [ b6.10 ] ) has the form@xmath423where the quantities @xmath424 @xmath425 are arbitrary . and the quantity @xmath426 is determined by the relation ( [ b5.30 ] ) .    substituting ( [ b6.12 ] ) - ( [ b6.14c ] ) in ( [ b6.11 ] ) , one obtains a constraint on the quantities @xmath427 @xmath424 @xmath425 . 
 independently of this constraint the 3-vector @xmath428has the same 3-length @xmath274 , as the length of 3-vector @xmath429 . 
 the angle between the 3-vectors @xmath430 and @xmath431is equal to @xmath350 . if @xmath432 , then @xmath325 , and vectors @xmath394 and @xmath433 are elements of the same helix .    we see that the stabilizing vector @xmath395 reduces wobbling of vector @xmath394 . in the case of equation ( [ a4.46 ] ) 
 the spatial component @xmath329 of the 4-vector @xmath318 may be infinite . in the case of the equation ( [ b6.9 ] ) 
 the length @xmath434 of the spatial component @xmath329 of the 4-vector @xmath318 is less , than @xmath435 thus , the stabilizing vector @xmath395 reduces the wobbling of the world chain . 
 one can not be sure , that this wobbling does not destroy the helical character of the world chain . 
 however , the main question is , whether or not the evolution of the world chain in the spacelike direction lead to the world chain , which is timelike on the average . 
 any next point @xmath436 of the world chain jumps along the timelike direction at the distance @xmath273 and in the 3-space , which is orthogonal to this direction , the point jumps at the distance @xmath437 . 
 direction of the jump in the 3-space is described by the vector @xmath430 , which is given by the relation ( [ c5.17 ] ) . 
 the length of @xmath430 is @xmath274 . if the direction of jump is completely random , the displacement @xmath438 for @xmath37 steps ( @xmath439 is proportional to @xmath440 , whereas displacement in the temporal direction is @xmath441 . 
 it means that the mean velocity @xmath442tends to zero for @xmath443 , although @xmath444 . in the case , if @xmath363 and the 3-vector @xmath430 * *  * * determined by ( [ c5.17 ] ) is not random , the world chain form a helix with timelike axis . in this case 
 the mean velocity tends to zero also . 
 it should expect that in the case , when the vector ( [ c5.17 ] ) is stochastic , but its stochasticity is restricted by the relation ( [ c5.17 ] ) ( the angle @xmath422 is completely random ) , the mean world chain will be also timelike on the average . 
 we can not prove this fact strictly now , but this result seems to be very probable . 
 the obtained classical helical world chain ( [ a4.6 ] ) associates with the classical dirac particle , which has alike world line ( [ e6.33 ] ) , ( e6.34 ) . 
 the direction of the mean momentum distinguishes from the direction of the 4-velocity . 
 this fact is characteristic for both particles ( the dirac particle , and the particle , described by the world chain ( a4.6 ) ) . 
 both particles have angular moment . for the dirac particle the mass @xmath175 , which enters in the dirac equation , distinguishes from the mass @xmath445 of the particle moving along the world line ( [ e6.33 ] ) , ( [ e6.34 ] ) @xcite . as to the mass of the particle , described by the world chain ( [ a4.6 ] ) , it is not yet determined . for determination of the mass , one needs to consider the world chain ( [ a4.6 ] ) of charged particle with the skeleton @xmath446 in the distorted space - time of klein - kaluza , containing electromagnetic field . 
 existence of helical world chain with timelike axis seems to be rather unexpected , because leading vectors @xmath259 of the chain are spacelike , and it corresponds to superluminal motion of a particle . 
 superluminal motion seems to be incompatible with the relativity principle , which admits only motion with the speed less , than the speed of the light . 
 however , this constraint is valid only for continuous space - time geometry , which admits unlimited divisibility . in a discrete geometry 
 there are no distances less , than some elementary length , and it is difficult to formulate the relativity principle statement on impossibility of superluminal motion . 
 one needs another more adequate formulation of the relativity principle .    is the space - time geometry ( [ a4.14 ] ) discrete ? at @xmath447 the space - time geometry ( [ a4.14 ] ) turns to the space - time geometry@xmath448which is certainly discrete , because in the space - time there no timelike intervals @xmath57 , which are less , than @xmath195 , and there are no spacelike intervals @xmath449 , which are less , than @xmath195 . in such a space - time geometry 
 there are no particles , whose geometrical mass @xmath199 is less than @xmath195 . 
 however , if @xmath214 , is the space - time geometry discrete ? to answer this question , we introduce the parameter of discreteness : the relative density of points in the space - time with respect to the point density in the space - time of minkowski . 
 let us define the quantity @xmath450 by means of the relation @xmath451 in the case ( [ a4.14 ] ) we have for @xmath452 $ ] @xmath453resolving ( [ a7.3 ] ) with respect to @xmath193 , we obtain @xmath454where@xmath455    taking into account ( [ a7.4 ] ) we obtain the world function @xmath193 as a function of @xmath233@xmath456the relative density of points in the space - time geometry @xmath276 with respect to the standard geometry @xmath275 of minkowski is given by the relation ( [ a7.2 ] ) . 
 the expression for @xmath457 is given by the relation@xmath458where @xmath459 is given by the relation @xmath460if @xmath461 and @xmath462 , we have approximately@xmath463 in the limit @xmath461 , when the world function ( [ a4.14 ] ) turns into the world function ( [ a7.1 ] ) of the completely discrete geometry , we obtain for the relative density@xmath464    thus , @xmath465 for @xmath466 , and this fact correspond to the space - time geometry ( [ a7.1 ] ) , where close points , for which @xmath467 , are absent . the relative density @xmath450 of points may serve as quantity , describing the discreteness of the space - time geometry and the character of this discreteness . 
 the discreteness may be complete , when the density @xmath468vanishes in some region as in the case ( [ a7.10 ] ) . 
 but the discreteness may be incomplete , as in the case ( [ a7.7 ] ) . in this case for @xmath469 
 we have @xmath470{g_{1}\left ( \sigma _ { \mathrm{d}}\right ) } + \frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{g_{1}\left ( \sigma _ { \mathrm{d}}\right ) } } \right ) , \qquad \sigma _ { \mathrm{d}}\in \left ( -2\lambda _ { 0}^{2},2\lambda _ { 0}^{2}\right )   \label{a7.11}\]]where@xmath471the expression ( [ a7.11 ] ) is a symmetric function of @xmath472 , as one can see from ( [ a7.3 ] ) . 
 it is symmetric , indeed , although it does not look formally as a symmetric function of @xmath233 . 
 numerical values of @xmath473 @xmath474 are presented in the table @xmath475the relative density @xmath450 is less , than unity . 
 it may be interpreted in the sense , that the space - time geometry is discrete only partly . 
 nevertheless the incompletely discrete space - time geometry discriminates most of world chains with spatial leading vector , remaining only some of them . 
 multivariance of particle motion and discrimination of some states of motion play the crucial role in structure of elementary particles , as well as in the structure of atoms . 
 let us explain this circumstance in the example of the hydrogen atom . according to laws of the classical mechanics the electron of the hydrogen atom is to fall onto the nucleus due to the coulomb attraction . 
 two reasons prevent from this falling : ( 1 ) multivariant ( stochastic ) motion of the electron , and ( 1 ) rotation of electron around the nucleus .    the multivariant motion of the electron leads to escape of the electron from the nuclear surface . 
 this process has the same nature , as an escape of dust from the earth surface . moving multivariantly ( as brownian particles ) , the flecks of dust form a stationary distribution in the gravitational field of the earth . 
 if multivariance of their motion is cut out , the flecks of the dust fall onto the surface of the earth . 
 statistical description of the electron distribution and the dust distribution are different , because the multivariant electron motion is conceptually relativistic , whereas the brownian particles motion is nonrelativistic . 
 one may describe brownian particles by means of probabilistic statistical description , whereas one may use only dynamical conception of statistical description for statistical description of multivariant motion of relativistic particles . 
 rotation of the electron around the nucleus creates the field of centrifugal force , which is added to the coulomb force . as a result 
 additional distributions of the electrons appear . 
 if the obtained distribution of electrons is nonstationary , the electrons emanate the electromagnetic radiation until the electron distribution becomes to be stationary . 
 thus , the electromagnetic radiation carries out discrimination of nonstationary states ( electron distributions ) . 
 the multivariance of the electron motion and mechanism of discrimination of non - stationary states generates the structure of the hydrogen atom and discrete character of the radiation spectra . from the mathematical viewpoint 
 the discrete character of the electron states is conditioned by procedure of the eigenstates determination . 
 only eigenstates of the hamilton operator appear to be stationary and stable . 
 the multivariance of the particle motion and some mechanism of discrimination play also the crucial role in the understanding of the structure of elementary particles . 
 however , in the case of the elementary particle structure the discrimination mechanism is conditioned by some metric ( geometric ) forces , which appear , when we use space - time geometry of minkowski instead of the real multivariant space - time geometry . 
 formally these forces have the form of additional terms of the type ( [ a4.18 ] ) in dynamic equations . 
 these additional terms are expressed via the space - time distortion @xmath250 . 
 they describe both multivariance of motion and the discrimination mechanism . 
 the multivariance of motion is associated with the multivariance of the vector equivalence definition ( [ a1.3 ] ) , whereas the discrimination mechanism is associated with the zero - variance of the same definition ( [ a1.3 ] ) for some vectors . 
 besides , as we have seen , the zero - variance ( discrimination ) is associated with the discreteness ( or partial discreteness ) of the space - time geometry . 
 it is very important , that consideration of multivariant space - time geometry _ is not a hypothesis _ , which needs an experimental test . 
 consideration of the multivariant space - time geometry is a corollary of correction of our imperfect conception of geometry . 
 conception of geometry , based on supposition that any space - time geometry may be axiomatized ( i.e. may be concluded from some system of axioms ) , is imperfect , because it does not admit one to construct multivariant geometry conceptually . 
 however , the motion of electrons and other elementary particles is multivariant . 
 multivariance of this motion is an experimental fact , which can not be ignored . 
 as far as the imperfect conception of geometry did not admit one to construct multivariant space - time geometry , investigators were forced to ascribe multivariance to dynamics , introducing quantum principles with all their attributes . 
 the quantum principles look enigmatic and artificial , because multivariance is ascribed to dynamics , whereas it should be ascribed to the space - time geometry . 
 multivariance and zero - variance as properties of the space - time geometry look as quite natural properties of the definition ( [ a1.3 ] ) . 
 indeed , it does not follow from anywhere , that equations ( [ a1.3 ] ) are to have unique solution for arbitrary world function , which determines the form of these equations 
 . absence of any hypotheses is a very important property of the geometrical approach to the structure of elementary particles . besides 
 , the geometrical dynamics is very general and simple . 
 dynamic equations of the geometric dynamics do not use even differential equations . 
 formulation of dynamic equations does not contain a reference to the coordinate system . on the other hand , when the geometric dynamics in the real space - time is described in terms of the space - time of minkowski , one obtains additional metric forces , which look rather exotic . 
 they can be obtained hardly in the framework of the conventional approach . 
 the conventional approach to the theory of elementary particles contains a lot of secondary concepts and properties . 
 one may not see any discrimination mechanism in wave functions , field equations , branes , symmetries and other remote corollaries of the unknown structure of elementary particles . 
 but it is impossible to obtain and to understand the discrete properties of elementary particles without a reliable mechanism of discrimination . 
 even if investigating and systematizing these remote corollaries , one succeeds to obtain a perfect systematization of elementary particles , one can obtain structure of elementary particles from the perfect systematization with the same success , as one can obtain the atomic structure from the periodical system of chemical elements . 
 consideration of t - geometry as a space - time geometry admits one to obtain dynamics of a particle as corollary of its geometrical structure . 
 evolution of the geometrical object in the space - time is determined by the skeleton @xmath476 of the geometrical object and by fixing of the leading vector @xmath4 . 
 the skeleton and the leading vector determine the world chain , which describes the evolution completely . 
 the world chain may wobble , it is manifestation of the space - time geometry multivariance . 
 quantum effects are only one of manifestation of the multivariance . 
 it is remarkable , that for determination of the world chain one does not need differential equations , which may be used only on the space - time manifold . 
 one does not need space - time continuity ( continual geometry ) . 
 of course , one may introduce the continual coordinate system and write dynamic differential equation there . 
 one may , but it is not necessary . in general , the geometrical dynamics ( i.e. dynamics generated by the space - time geometry ) is a discrete dynamics , where step of evolution is determined by the length of the leading vector . 
 it is possible , that one will need a development of special mathematical technique for the geometrical dynamics . 
 the real space - time geometry contains the quantum constant @xmath155 as a parameter . as a result 
 the geometric dynamics explains freely quantum effects , but not only them . 
 the particle mass is geometrized ( the particle mass is simply a length of some vector ) . as a result 
 the problem of mass of elementary particles is simply a geometrical problem . 
 it is a problem of the structure of elementary geometrical object and its evolution . 
 one needs simply to investigate different forms of skeletons of simplest geometrical objects . 
 in general , not all skeletons are possible , because at the spatial evolution the world chain is observable ( helical ) only for several skeletons . 
 additional points of skeleton lead to additional ( sometimes unexpected ) properties of corresponding elementary geometrical objects ( elementary particles ) . 
 note that the geometric dynamics does not contain a rotational motion . 
 it contains only a shift . 
 all vectors of the skeleton @xmath477 of the link @xmath478 are equivalent to vectors of the skeleton @xmath479 of the adjacent link @xmath480 . 
 such a situation is quite reasonable , because the geometrical dynamics describes evolution of free particles . the rotating particle can not be completely free , because in the rotating particle there is centripetal acceleration . 
 however , acceleration of all parts of the body has to be absent for completely free motion . on the other hand , 
 the geometric dynamics contains the spatial evolution , which absent in the conventional dynamics . from the geometrical viewpoint 
 we may not discriminate spatial evolution on the basis , that the leading vector @xmath4 is spacelike and its length is imaginary . 
 in fact the spatial evolution discriminates itself , by the fact , that the corresponding world chain is unobservable , in general . 
 it appears to be observable only for some complex skeletons , consisting of more , than two points . 
 the world chain , describing the spatial evolution is observable only in the case , when it may be localized near the world chain of the observer . 
 it takes place , when the world chain has a shape of a helix with timelike axis , or some other shape , which may be localized near the world chain of the observer . as a result 
 not all skeletons appear to be observable . 
 although the geometric dynamics does not contain a rotation , but the corollaries of the rotation ( angular momentum , magnetic momentum ) may be obtained as a result of the spatial evolution , when the world chain is a helix . 
 apparently , the fact , that such a `` particle rotation '' is a corollary of the spatial evolution , leads to the spin discreteness of the dirac particle . 
 of course , such statements are to be tested by exact mathematical investigations of different types of skeletons and of different space - time geometries . 
 however , such a statement of the problem is quite concrete and realizable . 
 note , that the geometric dynamics in the real ( non - minkowskian ) space - time contains additional terms with respect to dynamics in the space - time of minkowski . from viewpoint of the space - time of minkowski 
 these additional terms may be interpreted as some ( metric ) interactions , which take place inside the elementary particles . from the conventional viewpoint 
 these interactions look very exotic and strange . 
 it is impossible ( or very difficult ) to guess at them , starting from conventional conception of the space - time and dynamics . in the geometric dynamics 
 there are no additional interactions , if we use the true space - time geometry . however , additional interactions appear , if we use inadequate geometry ( for instance , geometry of minkowski , or riemannian geometry ) . in other words , it is possible to compensate false space - time geometry by introduction of additional interactions . 
 it is well known from the general relativity , that the motion of free body in the curved space - time looks as a motion in the gravitational field , if one interprets this motion as a motion in the space - time of minkowski . 
 description of conceptually new unknown phenomena by means of a change of the space - time geometry is simpler , than an introduction of additional interactions , because the space - time geometry is described by the world function , which is a function of two points . 
 the form of the world function for large distances is determined by the necessity of obtaining the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics . 
 restrictions , imposed on the world function at small distances , are determined by the condition , that the spatial evolution may describe the dirac particle . 
 ( very many elementary particles are the dirac particles ) . 
 besides , the condition of localization of the world chain ( helical world chain ) imposes restrictions on parameters of the particle . 
 not all parameters of particles appear to be possible . 
 this condition is a condition of `` peculiar quantization '' of the particle parameters , which include the particle mass . 
 let us note that the contemporary theory of elementary particles returns to geometrical considerations ( strings , branes ) . 
 however , these considerations are restricted by the framework of the riemannian geometries and geometries close to the riemannian geometry . 
 for instance , the quantum geometry , which uses operators instead of the point coordinates . this is some way of introduction of multivariance in the geometry . 
 however , this geometry is developed on the basis of the linear vector space , which is a restriction on the space - time geometry . in any case 
 the conventional approach to the space - time geometry considers only a part of all possible space - time geometries . 
 one can not be sure , that the class of considered geometries contains true space - time geometry . 
 of course , if one uses a false space - time geometry , there is a possibility to correct the false space - time geometry by means of additional interaction , generated by difference with the true space - time geometry . 
 but such a correction is difficult , especially if the true geometry is discrete or close to the discrete geometry . 
 note , that the geometry ( [ a4.0 ] ) is discrete , although it is given on the continuous manifold of minkowski . 
 it is discrete , because the module of distance between any two points is more , than @xmath195 . 
 it is very unexpected , because it is a common practice to consider any geometry on the manifold as a continuous geometry , although in reality the geometry is determined by the world function and only by the world function . 
 a discrete geometry is associated with a grid . 
 of course , a geometry , given on a grid , can not be continuous . 
 however , a geometry , given on the continuous set of points ( manifold ) , may be discrete .    why the microcosm physics of the twentieth century did leave the successful program of the physics geometrization and choose the alternative program of quantum theory ? 
 discovery of the electron diffraction need of multivariance of the microcosm physics . 
 multivariance may be taken into account either on the level of the space - time geometry , or on the level of dynamics . 
 the multivariant space - time geometry was not known in the thirtieth , when the electron diffraction was discovered . 
 the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics had been constructed already , and it was applied successfully for explanation of the electron diffraction .    the space - time geometry is a basis of dynamics . introducing multivariance in dynamics , one can describe not only nonrelativistic phenomena of microcosm . 
 one can describe also relativistic phenomena and that part of the microcosm physics , which is known as the theory of elementary particles . 
 the principles of quantum mechanics , which introduce multivariance in the microcosm physics , were invented for the newtonian conception of the space - time , and their extrapolation to the relativistic phenomena appeared to be problematic . 
 of course , some properties of the true space - time geometry may be taken into account by introduction of additional interactions . 
 however , it is very difficult to invent and introduce additional interactions without understanding of these innovations . 
 capacities of the geometrical approach are very large , especially if one takes into account all possible space - time geometries . 
 the theory of elementary particles returns to the geometrical description , but this description is burthened by such concepts as wave function , string , brane , which have very abstracted relation to the structure of elementary particles and microcosm physics .

 passes very near the line - of - sight to a background luminous source . in the case of a single point lens , two images of the source 
 are formed with a separation that scales with the angular radius of the einstein ring , @xmath1^{-1/2}$ ] , where @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the mass of the lens , its distance , and the distance to the source , respectively . for sources in the galactic bulge , 
 this separation is @xmath01  mas , and thus generally too close to be resolved . 
 the combined image brightness , however , can be observed and is a function of the changing projected distance between the lens and the observer - source line - of - sight . as the source moves through the axisymmetric magnification pattern generated by a single lens , a symmetric light curve results . 
 this symmetry is destroyed for multiple lenses such as binary star systems or planetary systems . 
 more complicated magnification patterns are formed , and the resulting light curve depends on the angle @xmath6 of the source trajectory . for binary lenses , the topology of the magnification map ( fig . 
 1 ) depends on only two parameters : the mass ratio @xmath7 of the lenses and their projected separation @xmath8 in units of the einstein ring radius . for typical galactic lenses , m dwarfs in the bulge or inner disk , 
 the physical size of the einstein radius is @xmath9  au . because typical @xmath10 are comparable to the orbital radius of many solar system planets , microlensing is an excellent way to search for planets , as first suggested by mao & paczynki ( 1991 ) and further developed by gould & loeb ( 1992 ) . 
 0.0cm=12.5 cm -4.25 cm    -0.5 cm    figure  1 shows the differential magnification effect of binary lenses as a function of their mass ratio @xmath11 and separation @xmath12 . 
 each panel covers an area @xmath13 on a side centered on the more massive primary lens . 
 the brightness of an image is proportional to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the jacobian that describes the coordinate transformation between the image and source planes . 
 the locus of points in the source plane for which @xmath16 is called the `` caustic curve . '' a source crossing the caustic will be highly magnified . 
 -8.5 cm -0.5 cm 
 -1 cm    since most microlensing events are alerted in real time only when the source lies near or inside @xmath17 , a light curve will reveal the binarity of the lens ( via an anomaly @xmath18 ) only if the source trajectory passes over the contours shown in fig  1 . 
 otherwise , the light curve will be indistinguishable from that due to a single isolated lens . 
 figure  2 illustrates this effect ; two possible source trajectories are shown passing the same distance from the `` central '' caustic , but different distances from the two , outer `` planetary '' caustics ( all three caustics are caused by the lens - planet combination ) . 
 the light curve associated with only one of these trajectories betrays the presence of the planet . since the deviation contours are most extended for @xmath11 and @xmath12 of order unity ( fig .  1 ) 
 , these types of binary lenses will be the easiest to detect . 
 even planets as small as the earth generate caustic structures as they orbit galactic lenses ; background sources passing over or near these caustics will experience a substantial additional microlensing effect due to the binarity of the lens . 
 the cross section of the planetary caustic and thus the probability that a random trajectory will pass over or near it decreases slowly with mass ratio ( dominik 1999 ) . 
 for this reason , microlensing  unlike most other planet detection methods  has _ sensitivity _ to terrestrial - mass planets . 
 this sensitivity is limited primarily by the sampling rate and precision of the photometry required to see signals that are reduced in amplitude by finite source effects for @xmath19 . 
 the _ efficiency _ with which planets of given @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be detected in a given light curve is a statistical quantity that depends on the photometric precision , sampling and duration of the photometric data and on the characteristics of the underlying event sampled , most notably its minimum impact parameter , @xmath20 , and the amount of blended non - lensed light in the same resolution element ( gaudi & sackett 2000 ) . 
 determination of detection efficiencies for individual light curves allows non - detections to be translated into statistical upper limits for a given class of planet .      in principle 
 , the _ detection _ of a microlensing anomaly can be quantified statistically , but its clear identification with a planetary lens relies on the _ characterization _ of the planet through determination of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . since any given event will not repeat , characterization must be obtained at the time of detection , and will require better data . with sufficient data quality , both @xmath12 and @xmath11 can be determined from light curve modeling , although in some cases the well - known @xmath21 `` degeneracy '' ( griest & safizadeh 1998 ; dominik 1999 ) will prevent a unique identification . 
 high magnification events are sensitive and reasonably efficient to the detection of small mass planets since their small @xmath20 brings them close to the central caustic generated by companions ( griest & safizadeh 1998 ) . 
 unfortunately , such detections may be particularly difficult to characterize , since all planets orbiting the primary lens will distort the central caustic ( gaudi , naber & sackett 1998 ) ; more massive ones will have an effect over a larger range of @xmath12 . 
 di  stefano and scalzo ( 1999 ) point out that current programs typically halt intensive monitoring when @xmath22 ; extended high - precision monitoring may detect and characterize planets at larger separation from their host lenses

 of 21 light curves consistent with binary lenses analyzed by macho , two produced acceptable fits with companion masses as small @xmath23 ( alcock et al . 
 the first suggestion of possible planetary - mass lenses ( bennett et al .  1997 ) came from macho survey data for macho  1994-blg-4 , which could be modelled as an m - dwarf/5@xmath24 pair , and macho  1995-blg-3 , a very short duration event modelled as an isolated 2@xmath24 lens . 
 however , many alternate interpretations were allowed by the infrequently sampled light curves inherent to survey data ( which must sample @xmath0@xmath25 stars nightly ! ) ; no firm planetary detection was claimed in either case . 
 the timescale @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the relative proper motion of lens and source ) of typical galactic microlensing events is weeks to months ; whereas planetary ( @xmath28 ) anomalies would have durations of hours to days . the necessity of round - the - clock monitoring for detection and characterization of short - lived planetary deviations prompted the establishment of international collaborations such as mps ( rhie et al . 
 2000 ) and planet ( albrow et al .  1998 ) , which obtain sub - day to sub - hourly photometry on events discovered by the survey teams macho , ogle and eros . 
 although tantalizing hints have been seen in some light curves ( see below ) , no clear _ planetary _ anomaly has been detected . 
 2.25 cm -4.0 cm    -0.25 cm    * macho 1997-blg-41 : * the very unusual event macho 1997-blg-41 caused a stir in the community : although clearly multiple lens microlensing , static stellar binary models did not fit the data . 
 bennett et al . 
 ( 1999 ) interpreted the double caustic structure as coming from a static triple system , a jovian planet orbiting a stellar binary . 
 the planet team , modeling their own data , instead showed that the light curve could be fit as a normal stellar binary ( albrow et al . 
 2000a ) whose rotation brings one of the triangular caustics across the source trajectory ( fig .  3 ) . 
 the proposed binary+jovian model was incompatible with planet data .    * 
 ogle 2000-bul-12 : * recently , yock et al . 
 ( 2000 ) have suggested that a planet may be orbiting the primary lens of event ogle  2000-bul-12 , based on analysis of public domain ogle data ( udalski & szymanski 2000 ) that displayed a possible anomaly at peak . 
 unpublished planet team data indicates no anomaly and much smaller scatter at the same temporal position ( fig .  4 ) . 
 0.5cm=6.5 cm -6.75 cm 6.75cm=6.75 cm -0.25 cm    -0.25 cm    * macho 1998-blg-35 : * although ruling out a large class of high - mass planets orbiting the lens of macho  1998-blg-35 (  4.1 ) , the mps and moa groups ( rhie et al . 
 2000 ) noticed a weak anomaly near the peak of this high amplification event that they interpreted as intriguing evidence of a low - mass companion with @xmath29 . 
 the signal fell below the formal mps / moa detection limit . 
 planet team data for this event did not confirm this detection ; the planet light curve was consistent with an isolated point lens ( albrow et al . 
 current microlensing planet searches have appreciable efficiency for the detection of companions with mass ratio @xmath30 , ie . , planets with masses of order @xmath31 . 
 the lack of detected perturbations consistent with planets in this mass range allows constraints to be placed on the abundance of jovian analogs around typical stars ( ie , lenses ) in the milky way .    the first published exclusion diagram ( fig . 
 5 ) for companions in an individual lensing system was presented by the mps / moa collaborations for macho  98-blg-35 ( rhie et al . 
 2000 ) . due to the high amplification of this event 
 , the source would have passed very near any ( central ) caustic structure due to massive companions . since no anomaly consistent with jovian - mass companions 
 was seen , exclusion contours could be derived as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath12 for this lensing system ( fig . 
 the planet collaboration performed a similar analysis for another high amplification event , ogle  1998-bul-14 ( albrow et al . 
 1999b ) . when converted to parameters appropriate to a solar - type lens in the bulge and averaged over all orbital inclinations , the exclusion contours for jovian and super - jovian planets in the ogle  1998-bul-14 overlap the region of parameter space inhabited by current planet detections by the radial velocity technique ( fig .  5 ) . 
 for the most part , however , microlensing is sensitive planets at larger orbital radii ( 1 - 10  au ) than is the doppler technique .

 no clear planetary anomalies were observed in these 43 events , implying that less than one - third of @xmath00.3  m@xmath39 stars have jovian - mass companions with semi - major axes in the range 1.5 au@xmath384 au ( fig . 
 weaker limits are placed on the existence of jovian planets orbiting in the range 1 au@xmath387 au . 
 these are the first constraints on exoplanets orbiting the most common of galactic stars : m - dwarfs . 
 as with all techniques , microlensing has advantages and disadvantages . in the cadre of exoplanet search techniques , it offers the opportunity to _ detect and characterize jovian planets at large orbital radius ( 1 - 10  au ) without waiting for one or more orbital periods_. currently , it also has more _ sensitivity to neptune - mass planets _ than any other ground - based search technique . in the future , 
 this sensitivity may be enhanced and extended with new facilities on the ground ( peale 1997 , sackett 1997 ) and in space ( rhie , this conference ) . 
 challenges must be overcome to detect and characterize earth - mass planets with reasonable efficiency _ 
 , including the diluting effect of finite source size on the magnification gradient due to small caustics ( bennett & rhie 1996 , gaudi & sackett 2000 ) . 
 currently , the mass ratio ( but not the mass ) and the projected separation in units of @xmath17 ( but not in au ) of a lensing planet can be determined from an anomaly . 
 more information may be forthcoming in the future . 
 _ large - aperture spectroscopy _ of an event may yield spectroscopic identification of the faint primary lens against the sea of source star light ( mao , reetz & lennon 1998 ) , thereby allowing the mass of the primary and @xmath17 to be estimated . 
 measurement of the _ photometric centroid motion _ due to the changing position and brightness of the microimages ( astrometric microlensing ) , could yield the mass of the lens ( dominik & sahu 2000 , han 2000 , gould & han 2000 ) , and a more robust determination of planetary parameters ( safizadeh , dalal & griest 1999 ) .","specially - designed microlensing searches , some of which have been underway for several years , are sensitive to extrasolar planets orbiting the most common stars in our galaxy .

26,"the value of the circular orbital velocity at the sun s radius in the milky way is of considerable interest in galactic and extragalactic astrophysics . 
 it is necessary to correct observed velocities of stars and galaxies for the motion of the sun around the galactic center . 
 the circular velocity also plays a large role in characterizing the mass of the milky way in comparison with other spiral galaxies , placing it in a cosmological context , e.g. , when asking whether the milky way matches the tully  fisher relation ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) or what is its total star formation efficiency ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 the circular velocity at the sun s radius has typically been established by measuring the sun s motion with respect to an object assumed to be at rest with respect to the galaxy ( sgr a@xmath2 : @xcite ; the stellar halo : @xcite ) , or by using a tracer population assumed to be angle - mixed , i.e. , having a uniform distribution of orbital phases , in a steady - state galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 recently , a competitive estimate has been obtained by a different approach using a narrow stellar stream that is assumed to be tracing out an orbit @xcite .    in this paper 
 we re - analyze a new population of tracers of milky way dynamics : masers associated with star - forming regions ( * ? ? ? 
 * r09 ) . using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) and 
 the japanese vlbi  exploration of radio astronomy ( vera ) , precise measurements of the parallaxes , proper motions , and line - of - sight velocities of masers have been made ( see r09  and references therein ) . 
 these give accurate full six - dimensional phase - space information in the disk of the galaxy . 
 since these massive star - forming regions are associated with spiral arms and their shocks , the dense molecular gas regions that produce masers do not lie on exactly circular orbits , nor are they detected at random points on their orbits . 
 therefore , modeling approaches that assume a uniform distribution of the orbital phases of the tracer population can not give accurate determinations of the dynamics of the galaxy . 
 for the existing maser data , the problem of non - random orbital phases is exacerbated by the sparseness of the sample  only 18 masers with accurate six - dimensional phase - space information have been measured at present  and by the spatially non - uniform selection of the current sample of masers .    in this paper 
 , we perform an analysis of the r09  maser data that deals simultaneously with the sparseness of the data , the spatial non - uniformity of the sampling , the non - random orbital phase distribution of masers , and prior information . assuming a flat rotation curve , @xmath7 constant 
 , we use a simple model for the distribution of the maser velocities with respect to their local standards of rest : a mean offset from circular rotation @xmath8 and a general velocity dispersion tensor fixed in galactocentric cylindrical coordinates . in the probabilistic inference framework that we use  described in @xmath9  [ 
 sec : data]we can marginalize over the uncertainty in the inferred distribution function of masers , take prior information on the dynamics of the galaxy into account , use the sparse data set as efficiently as possible , and then ask what information on @xmath5 the maser data provide . 
 our results presented in @xmath9  [ sec : results ] show that allowing for a finite velocity dispersion tensor in the model for the maser peculiar - velocity distribution function leads to lower values of @xmath5 than the large value reported in r09 , in whose analysis the maser velocity dispersion was ( implicitly ) assumed to vanish . adding in informative prior information about @xmath10 , inferred from monitoring stellar orbits around the black hole at the center of the galaxy @xcite and from the measurement of the proper motion of sgr a@xmath2 @xcite 
 , we find that the best circular velocity estimate is @xmath3 km s@xmath1 , but that the current maser data set adds little information . 
 we discuss this measurement and its limitations in the light of other recent determinations in @xmath9  [ sec : discussion ] . 
 throughout the analysis that follows we use the standard cylindrical galactocentric coordinate frame @xmath11 , with associated unit vectors ( @xmath12 ) pointing toward the galactic center , in the direction of galactic rotation , and toward the north galactic pole , respectively . 
 the data we analyze here consist of the galactic coordinates , parallaxes , proper motions , and line - of - sight velocities of 18 galactic masers , as well as their associated uncertainties , presented in table 1 of @xcite . 
 following r09 , we add a 7 km s@xmath1 uncertainty in quadrature to the uncertainties in the velocity components of each maser to describe the random , virial motion in the massive star - forming region of the individual massive star associated with each maser . 
 the line - of - sight velocities have been ` corrected ' by the radio observatories pipelines for the motion of the sun with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) . 
 this correction assumed a value of 20 km s@xmath1 toward @xmath13(b1900.0)= 18@xmath14 , @xmath15(b1900.0)=@xmath16 for the solar motion @xmath17 , although it is unclear whether all observatories used this standard value ( m.  reid , private communication ) . 
 we undo this correction , after which the currently accepted correction for @xmath17  can be applied ; however , as we will describe below , this correction will become part of our model and , therefore , the correction for @xmath17  does not occur during the preprocessing of the data .    beyond these two corrections , 
 no processing of the @xcite data has been done . 
 parameter estimation in a probabilistic framework _ by necessity 
 _ uses bayes s theorem to connect the probability of the model parameters given the data @xmath18 to the probability of the observed data given the model parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 this requires us ( 1 ) to identify all the parameters that need to be included in the model , ( 2 ) to write down the likelihood of the model and ( 3 ) to specify suitable priors for the model parameters . 
 although the model space needs to be exhaustive , the probabilistic framework allows integration over uninteresting parameters . 
 here we put forward a model for the maser kinematics in which the maser velocities are most easily modeled in galactocentric cylindrical coordinates . in order to go from the raw data described in @xmath9  [ sec : datasub ] to the velocity of each maser in galactocentric coordinates , we need to ( 1 ) correct the measured velocity for @xmath17 , ( 2 ) add to this velocity the circular velocity around the galactic center at the sun s radius , and ( 3 ) project this velocity onto the galactocentric coordinate frame ( the details of this transformation are described in the appendix of r09 ) . since the latter procedure includes 
 geometrical projection factors depending on the distance @xmath10  of the sun from the galactic center , the model parameters need to include the three components of @xmath17 , @xmath10 , and @xmath5 . however , it is more practical to assume that sgr a@xmath2 is at rest with respect to the galaxy , and to use the proper motion @xmath19 of sgr a@xmath2 @xcite as a model parameter instead of the circular velocity , as @xmath19 is very tightly constrained independently of @xmath10 . 
 these two parameters are related simply by multiplying the proper motion of sgr a@xmath2 by @xmath10 and correcting this for @xmath17 . 
 the circular velocity then becomes a parameter derived from the actual model parameters , which is no problem in the probabilistic framework , where it is easy to propagate uncertainties correctly . as we will assume that the rotation curve is flat , no extra parameters to model the shape of the rotation curve need to be included in the model . 
 if we had uniformly sampled the phase space of masers and full prior knowledge of the phase - space distribution function of massive star - forming regions , this would uniquely specify the likelihood of the model , as the probability of the measured position and velocity of each maser would simply be given by the distribution function of the masers convolved with the observational uncertainty . 
 however , we have neither a uniform sample of masers nor much prior information about the distribution of masers throughout the galaxy . to account for the spatial non - uniformity of the sample we will focus on the distribution of velocities at the actually observed position of the maser , instead of using the full six - dimensional phase - space distribution function to evaluate the likelihood . 
 for this distribution we will assume that it only depends on the peculiar velocity @xmath20 of the maser in galactocentric cylindrical coordinates . 
 we will assume that this distribution of peculiar velocities is given by a gaussian distribution characterized by a mean , a 3-vector @xmath21 , the offset from circular motion , and a general velocity dispersion tensor , a symmetric @xmath22 tensor @xmath23 with six free parameters . 
 since there have been no measurements of either the mean offset from circular motion of the masers or their velocity dispersion , we will use flat priors on these quantities . 
 this model is essentially a generalization of the model used in @xcite where the velocity dispersion tensor was assumed to vanish ; this was a poor assumption as we will show below . 
 the probability of a single maser is thus given by @xmath24|{\ensuremath{\overline{{{\boldsymbol{{\mathbf{v}}}}}}}},{\ensuremath{\mbox{\boldmath$\sigma$}}}\right)\otimes p({{\boldsymbol{{\mathbf{x}}}}},{{\boldsymbol{{\mathbf{v}}}}}|{{\boldsymbol{{\mathbf{x}}}}_i}^{\mathrm{obs}},{{\boldsymbol{{\mathbf{v}}}}_i}^{\mathrm{obs}})\,,\ ] ] where we have suppressed the dependence of @xmath25 on the dynamical parameters , and where the convolution with the observational uncertainty distribution @xmath26 has been included . 
 the posterior distribution for the 14 model parameters is then given by @xmath27 where the first factor on the right - hand side is the prior probability distribution for these parameters and the product is the likelihood . 
 we have used flat priors for @xmath21 and @xmath23 , which is why they do not appear explicitly . 
 for @xmath19 we use a gaussian prior with a mean of 30.24 km s@xmath1 kpc @xmath1 and a standard deviation of 0.12 km s@xmath1 kpc@xmath1 @xcite . for @xmath10 
 we combine current state - of - the - art determinations of @xmath10  from galactic center orbits with equal weights : 8.0 @xmath28 0.6 kpc found by @xcite and 8.33 @xmath28 0.35 kpc found by @xcite . 
 this prior is shown as the gray curve in  [ fig : ro ] . for @xmath17 
 we use the value and uncertainties obtained from _ hipparcos _ 
 data @xcite , although the clumpiness of the velocity distribution of nearby stars @xcite implies an uncertainty more on the order of a few km s@xmath1 in the value of @xmath17  ( j.  bovy & d.  w.  hogg , in preparation ) . 
 the implied prior for the circular velocity is shown as the thick gray curve in  [ fig : thetao ] . to investigate how informative the maser measurements are about @xmath5 and @xmath10 
 , we will consider the effect of dropping ( some combination of ) these priors below . 
 the framework described here can easily be generalized to more general descriptions of the distribution of the peculiar velocities of the masers . in what follows 
 we will use a distribution function that is the sum of two gaussian distributions , the second having half of the weight and twice the dispersion of the first gaussian , to determine the possible effect of outliers .      in order to explore the posterior distribution for all of the model parameters in light of the maser data we use a simple markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method @xcite . 
 this procedure is described in some detail in the appendix .    the practical complication in evaluating the likelihood given in equations  ( [ eq : onelike ] ) and ( [ eq : posterior ] ) for each of the masers comes from the fact that the observational uncertainties are gaussian in the space of observed quantities  more specifically , for the parallax  but are non - gaussian in the space of the peculiar velocities . however , if the relative parallax uncertainty is small ( @xmath29percent ) we can confidently propagate the uncertainties to the space of peculiar velocities , where the convolution of the gaussian velocity distribution model for the peculiar velocities with the observational gaussian uncertainty distribution is simple . 
 a few of the masers have relative parallax uncertainties larger than 10percent , but we have nonetheless propagated the uncertainties in the gaussian approximation . to check that this does not bias our results 
 we have also run our analysis using a full numerical convolution with the actual observational uncertainties and we find results that are barely distinguishable from the results presented below . 
 the main scientific goal of this paper is to understand what the maser measurements tell us about @xmath5 . 
 the posterior probability distribution for @xmath5 , fully marginalized over all of the parameters of the maser distribution function , the solar motion with respect to the lsr , the distance to the galactic center , and the proper motion of sgr a@xmath2 , is shown in  [ fig : thetao ] . 
 the analogously marginalized posterior distribution for @xmath10  is shown in  [ fig : ro ] . 
 also shown in  [ fig : thetao ] is the posterior we obtained when we drop the informative prior on @xmath19 . 
 the posterior distributions for the proper motion of sgr a@xmath2 and for the components of @xmath17  are not shown here . 
 they are all basically identical to their prior distributions , implying that the masers  not surprisingly  cannot inform us about these quantities .    while the prior on @xmath5 in  [ fig : thetao ] peaks at 244 km s@xmath1 with a 1sigma uncertainty of 16 km s@xmath1 , the posterior for @xmath5 is peaked at a value of 244 km s@xmath1 with a 1sigma uncertainty of about 13 km s@xmath1 . 
 this equal value for @xmath5 after analyzing the masers is in qualitative contrast to the initial analysis of r09 , who found that it raised the peak to 254 km s@xmath1 . 
 this difference arises mainly from our more general model for the distribution function of the masers . 
 if we insist within our analysis that the velocity dispersion of the masers is zero , we find a posterior distribution for the circular velocity that is peaked at 255 km s@xmath1 , in rough agreement with the r09  results . 
 the light gray line in  [ fig : thetao ] shows what happens when we drop the informative prior on @xmath19 , while keeping the @xmath10 prior : @xmath0 km s@xmath1 . 
 this and the fact that the posterior probability is barely narrower than the prior , tells us that the current maser measurements have not much power to constrain @xmath5 . 
 the posterior estimate for the distance to the galactic center is @xmath30 kpc ; this shows that the masers lead to a small improvement to our knowledge of the sun s distance to the galactic center . without the informative prior on @xmath19 the posterior estimate for @xmath10 
 is the same as the prior estimate : @xmath31 kpc .    at the same time 
 , the mcmc procedure provides fully marginalized posterior distributions for the parameters of the conditional velocity distribution function of masers , which are given in  [ fig : dist ] : shown are the posterior distributions for the three components of the mean offset from circular velocity of the masers , i.e. , the mean peculiar velocity , in cylindrical coordinates ( toward the galactic center , in the direction of galactic rotation , and toward the north galactic pole ) as well as for the trace of the velocity dispersion tensor . from this 
 we confirm the mean lag of 15 km s@xmath1we find a lag of @xmath32 km s@xmath1of the masers with respect to their local standards of rest previously found by r09 . 
 [ fig : dist ] shows that the masers have a mean velocity toward the galactic center of @xmath33 km s@xmath1 . 
 taken together , these mean peculiar velocities imply that the masers are typically just past the apocenter of their orbits . 
 we also find a mean velocity component of @xmath34 km s@xmath1 in the direction toward the north galactic pole .    from the posterior distribution for the trace of the velocity dispersion tensor 
 we see that the masers have a relative large velocity dispersion@xmath35 km s@xmath1]@xmath37larger than might be expected from a comparison with the velocity dispersion of young stars in the solar neighborhood , whose trace is about [ 14 km s@xmath1]@xmath37 @xcite . 
 since we put no restrictions on the form of @xmath23 we also obtain posterior probability distributions for all of the components of @xmath23 : for the diagonal components we find @xmath38 km s@xmath1 , @xmath39 km s@xmath1 , and @xmath40 km s@xmath1 . as we discuss below 
 , the fact that we obtain these large values could be because our model for the conditional velocity distribution is too restrictive .    in order to assess the possible affect of outliers on our inference , 
 we have performed the same analysis assuming a distribution of the peculiar velocities which consists of a mixture of two gaussian distributions , identical in every aspect except that the second gaussian has half of the weight and twice the dispersion of the first gaussian ( by doubling each component of the velocity dispersion tensor ) . 
 we find the same posterior distributions for the dynamical parameters and the mean offset ; the inferred dispersion of the masers is , predictably , somewhat smaller : the trace of the covariance matrix peaks at [ 22 km s@xmath1]@xmath37 . 
 two specific candidate outliers , the sources ngc 7538 and g 23.6 - 0.1 , were identified and removed from the sample by r09 , because they displayed large post - fit residuals . to assess whether these two sources affect our results significantly , the same analysis as described above of the r09  basic sample of 16 masers was performed , leaving out the sources ngc 7538 and g  23.6 - 0.1 . 
 we find basically the same result : @xmath41 km s@xmath1 . 
 thus , as opposed to r09 , who found that these two sources significantly raise the circular velocity derived from the maser data , our result is robust with respect to their inclusion . 
 we have re - analyzed the recent maser kinematics from r09 , to see what they tell us about @xmath42 and the maser orbits . 
 our analysis differs from that of r09  by allowing for a more general model for the distribution of the velocities of the masers with respect to their local standards of rest , by using a proper probabilistic framework that includes proper marginalization over uninteresting parameters , and by the explicit inclusion of suitable prior information . from this 
 , we find an estimate of @xmath5 of @xmath43 km s@xmath1 , the same value as the mode of our prior , and substantially lower than the estimate of r09 . 
 our analysis has also shown that the current maser measurements have only limited power to constrain @xmath5 beyond the prior ; dropping the prior coming from the measured proper motion of sgr a@xmath2 we find @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ; further dropping the prior information on @xmath10 , the maser data provide no constraint on @xmath5 at all . 
 the value for @xmath5 that we have inferred in this paper from the kinematics of galactic masers compares favorably with other recent measurements of the circular velocity . as is clear from  [ fig : thetao ] 
 , the posterior probability distribution for the circular velocity is peaked at about the same value as the prior probability distribution obtained from combining the precise measurements of the distance to the galactic center , the proper motion of sgr a@xmath2 , and the solar motion in the direction of galactic rotation . 
 it is also consistent with the value of @xmath44 km s@xmath1 from a recent measurement based on the completely different principle of fitting an orbit to the gd-1 stellar stream @xcite . combining these estimates by inverse variance weighting we find a value for the circular velocity of @xmath45 km s@xmath1 . 
 the results in this paper are unaffected by the uncertainty in the value of the solar motion with respect to the lsr . 
 if we use a larger uncertainty in the value of @xmath46 of 3 km s@xmath1 in each component , as suggested by an analysis of the effect of moving groups on @xmath46 ( j.  bovy & d.  w.  hogg , in preparation ) , we retrieve the same estimate @xmath47 km @xmath1 as before . 
 even when we use an uncertainty of 15 km s@xmath1 in the value of each component of @xmath46 , we find a slight increase in the uncertainty , but still the same value @xmath48 km s@xmath1 . 
 thus , the uncertainty in @xmath46 only affects our conclusions if it is larger than about 10 km s@xmath1 . 
 we also learned that the masers on average lag @xmath5 and are moving toward the galactic center . 
 this fact is illustrated in s  [ fig : dist ] and [ fig : phases ] , where the orbital phases of the masers are shown for a logarithmic potential @xmath49 ( e.g. , equation  ( 3.14 ) in * ? ? ? 
 * ) assuming @xmath50 kpc and @xmath51 km s@xmath1 . 
 this will be interesting to analyze in the context of spiral shock models . 
 our analysis implies that the present maser data do not lead to a substantive improvement of our knowledge of @xmath10  and @xmath5 , as most of the information in the data is spent on determining the properties of the conditional velocity distribution of the masers . 
 it is also remarkable that , given all of the prior information , the masers are much more informative about @xmath10  than they are about the angular rotation speed at the sun s radius , as the posterior distribution for @xmath52 is barely distinguishable from the prior distribution .    despite the fact that most of the information content in the maser data is already being used to infer the distribution function , it is possible that our model for the distribution function is not general enough . 
 for one , it is very likely that the distribution function of the masers depends on the galactocentric radius and , in particular , that the mean velocity offset in the direction toward the galactic center depends on radius . 
 indeed , there is some indication of that already in our results , as the large velocity dispersion of the masers is mostly driven by a large velocity dispersion in the direction toward the galactic center ; this could be due to an unmodeled radial dependence of the distribution function . 
 the measurement of the dynamics of the galaxy performed here uses a tracer population that is obviously non - angle mixed but has no unambiguous non - angle - mixed interpretation  such as a stellar stream tracing out an orbit . 
 such a measurement has the fundamental problem that structure in the distribution function of the tracers is , in a sense , exchangeable with complexity of the potential . 
 therefore , detailed measurements of the potential of the galaxy using larger samples of masers will very likely be fundamentally limited by our lack of knowledge about the distribution function of the masers . as more masers with precise 
 kinematic information become available  as many as 400 are possible over the next few years ( m.  reid , private communication)more detailed inferences of the distribution function will have to be made simultaneously with more precise measurements of the potential of the galaxy from these masers . 
 the method described and used in this paper is flexible enough to handle these more general distribution functions and more general models for the potential of the galaxy .

 we explore the posterior probability distribution using a metropolis - hastings ( mh ) mcmc algorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ) . the mh algorithm works by proposing new model parameters @xmath53 from a proposal distribution @xmath54 that can only depend on the current values @xmath55 of the parameters . 
 one then computes the quantity @xmath56 if @xmath57 one accepts the new state ; if @xmath58 , the new state is accepted with probability @xmath59 . if the new state is rejected , the old state is added again as a sample of the posterior . 
 this procedure converges to give samples from the posterior .    as proposal distributions we use : 
 ( 1 ) the prior for the components of @xmath17 , ( 2 ) a gaussian for @xmath10  and @xmath19 centered on the current values with widths of 0.5 kpc and 0.12 km s@xmath1 kpc@xmath1 , respectively , ( 3 ) a gaussian for the mean offset centered on the current values with a width of @xmath60 km s@xmath1 for each component , and ( 4 ) a wishart distribution for the velocity dispersion tensor with mean equal to the current tensor and shape parameter @xmath61 . 
 the widths of these last three proposal distributions were chosen so as to give an acceptable acceptance rate of about 50percent . 
 monte carlo chains were run with different sets of parameters of the proposal distributions and the resulting posterior probability distributions were found to be independent of the parameters of the proposal distributions .

galaxies placing it in a cosmological context e g when asking whether the milky way matches the tully fisher relation e g or what is its total star formation efficiency e g the circular velocity at the sun s radius has typically been established by measuring the sun s motion with respect to an object assumed to be at rest with respect to the galaxy sgr a xmath2 the stellar halo or by using a tracer population assumed to be angle mixed i e having a uniform distribution of orbital phases in a steady state galaxy e g recently a competitive estimate has been obtained by a different approach using a narrow stellar stream that is assumed to be tracing out an orbit. at the same time the mcmc procedure provides fully marginalized posterior distributions for the parameters of the conditional velocity distribution function of masers which are given in fig dist shown are the posterior distributions for the three components of the mean offset from circular velocity of the masers i e the mean peculiar velocity in cylindrical coordinates toward the galactic center in the direction of galactic rotation and toward the north galactic pole as well as for the trace of the velocity dispersion tensor. adding in informative prior information about inferred from monitoring stellar orbits around the black hole at the center of the galaxy and from the measurement of the proper motion of sgr a xmath2 we find that the best circular velocity estimate is km s xmath1 but that the current maser data set adds little information. as proposal distributions we use 1 the prior for the components of 2 a gaussian for and centered on the current values with widths of 0 5 kpc and 0 12 km s xmath1 kpc xmath1 respectively 3 a gaussian for the mean offset centered on the current values with a width of km s xmath1 for each component and 4 a wishart distribution for the velocity dispersion tensor with mean equal to the current tensor and shape parameter. from the posterior distribution for the trace of the velocity dispersion tensor we see that the masers have a relative large velocity dispersion xmath35 km s xmath1 xmath37larger than might be expected from a comparison with the velocity dispersion of young stars in the solar neighborhood whose trace is about 14 km s xmath1 xmath37. as is clear from fig thetao the posterior probability distribution for the circular velocity is peaked at about the same value as the prior probability distribution obtained from combining the precise measurements of the distance to the galactic center the proper motion of sgr a xmath2 and the solar motion in the direction of galactic rotation. parameter estimation in a probabilistic framework _ by necessity _ uses bayes s theorem to connect the probability of the model parameters given the data to the

3 to specify suitable priors for the model parameters. in order to go from the raw data described in sec datasub to the velocity of each maser in galactocentric coordinates we need to 1 correct the measured velocity for 2 add to this velocity the circular velocity around the galactic center at the sun s radius and 3 project this velocity onto the galactocentric coordinate frame the details of this transformation are described in the appendix of r09 . in order to assess the possible affect of outliers on our inference we have performed the same analysis assuming a distribution of the

27,"as has been pointed out previously by harney @xcite , finite vector analyzing powers @xmath3 arise in reaction processes only , if at least two different partial waves interfere . hence in case of an isolated @xmath4-channel resonance , which is formed by a single partial wave matching to spin and parity of the resonance , the analyzing powers in the resonance region will be vanishing small , if there is no sizeable interfering background from other reaction processes .    recently , in the reaction @xmath5 a pronounced , narrow resonance structure corresponding to a mass of 2.38 gev and a width of about 70 mev has been observed in the total cross section near @xmath6 2.4 gev ( @xmath7 = 1.2 gev ) @xcite . 
 its quantum numbers have been determined to be @xmath8 @xcite . 
 the @xmath4-channel character of this resonance has been established recently by polarized @xmath9 scattering . 
 inclusion of these new data into the said partial - wave analysis produces a pole in the coupled @xmath10-@xmath11 partial - waves at ( @xmath12 ) mev @xcite . since then this resonance is denoted by @xmath1 . 
 the @xmath13 channel is the @xmath2 decay channel with the smallest amount of background from other reaction processes @xcite . 
 nevertheless it has sizeable contributions from @xmath14-channel @xmath15 and @xmath16 excitations . 
 both of them are very well known from the study of @xmath17-induced two - pion production @xcite . 
 hence , due to the finite background amplitudes we may expect sizeable analyzing powers @xmath18 in the region of the @xmath2 resonance . 
 also , they are expected to increase with increasing energy due to the increasing contribution of higher partial waves . 
 since @xmath18 is composed only of interference terms of partial waves , it is sensitive to even small partial - wave contributions and therefore qualifies as a sensitive spectroscopic tool for the investigation of the @xmath2 resonance region . 
 in order to investigate this issue in a comprehensive way we measured the basic _ isoscalar _ double - pionic fusion process @xmath0 exclusively and kinematically complete . 
 the experiment was carried out with the wasa detector setup @xcite at cosy via the reaction @xmath19 using a polarized deuteron beam at the lab energy @xmath20 = 2.27 gev . since due to fermi motion of the nucleons in the beam deuteron the quasifree reaction proceeds via a range of effective collision energies , we cover the energy region 2.30 gev @xmath21 2.47 gev . 
 the emerging deuterons as well as the fast , quasifree scattered spectator protons were detected in the forward detector of wasa and identified by the @xmath22e - e technique . 
 gammas from the @xmath23 decay were detected in the central detector .    that way the full four - momenta were determined for all particles of an event . since the reaction was measured kinematically overdetermined , kinematic fits with 6 overconstraints 
 could be performed for each event . from the full kinematic information available for each event also the relevant total energy in the @xmath24 system 
 could be reconstructed for each event individually .    by just having a different trigger these measurements 
 have been obtained in parallel to the ones for @xmath24 elastic scattering @xcite . 
 the trigger used for the detection of the @xmath13 events required at least one hit in the forward detector and three neutral hits in the central detector .    for details of the experiment , in particular also with respect to the determination of the beam polarization , checks for quasifree scattering and the procedure for deriving @xmath18 from the data , see ref .

 the intermediate @xmath22 from the process @xmath31 has been reconstructed from the 4-momenta of its decay products @xmath23 and nucleon  the latter by taking half the deuteron momentum , thereby neglecting the small correction due to fermi motion of the nucleons inside the deuteron . since the dalitz plot displayed in fig .  4 of ref . 
 @xcite exhibits a @xmath22 excitation band sitting upon no substantial background , no cut on the @xmath22 mass appears to be necessary . 
 the data have been binned into three energy bins as displayed in figs .  1 - 3 : @xmath25  =  2.30  -  2.35  gev with center of gravity at 2.34  gev , @xmath25  =   2.36  -  2.40  gev with centroid at 2.38  gev and @xmath25  =  2.41  -  2.47  gev centered at 2.42  gev . 
 the middle one corresponds to the maximum cross section of the @xmath2 resonance , whereas the other two roughly correspond to its half maximum . at the lowest energy bin 
 the analyzing power in dependence of the deuteron scattering angle is still small . 
 however , substantial @xmath18 values are obtained at the two higher energy bins .    in the following the description of the data 
 is based on the formalism outlined in ref . 
 @xcite . based on that work @xmath18 angular dependencies 
 have been derived in ref . 
 @xcite , which can be theoretically expected in @xmath17 induced , _ 
 i.e. _ purely isovector two - pion production , if there are only relative @xmath4- and @xmath32- waves in the final channel :    @xmath33    with the parameters a and b to be adjusted to the data .    for the @xmath5 reaction 
 the situation changes insofar as we deal here with a purely isoscalar channel . 
 in addition @xmath34-waves have to be included , in order to allow the formation of @xmath1 . for simplicity 
 we assume the @xmath35 system to be in relative @xmath4-wave . 
 at least for the resonance formation this is well justified @xcite . applying the formalism presented in ref . 
 @xcite to this situation @xcite we again end up with a formal description in terms of @xmath36 :    @xmath37    due to the involvement of @xmath34-waves the sum runs now over 4 terms ( j = 1 , ... 4 ) from @xmath38 until @xmath39 . 
 the weighting parameters @xmath40 ... @xmath41 to be adjusted to the data have now the following meaning :    @xmath42    here @xmath43 denotes the momentum of the @xmath35 system relative to the deuteron and the strength parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 stand for the transitions :    @xmath46    where on the left - hand side the @xmath47 partial wave in the entrance channel is given by its spectroscopic nomenclature . 
 the right - hand side denotes the partial wave of the deuteron together with its angular momentum relative to the @xmath35 system . 
 the interference of these partial waves , which are abbreviated by @xmath4 , @xmath32 and @xmath34 , is indicated in brackets at the right - hand side of eq . 
 note that in the entrance channel @xmath48 and @xmath49 as well as @xmath10 and @xmath11 are coupled partial waves . in principle , also the @xmath48 - @xmath49 coupled waves contribute to the @xmath50 configurations . 
 however , for simplicity we omit this contribution , since it is expected to be small compared to the contribution of the @xmath2 resonance .    in order to see how many terms in the expansion ( 3 ) 
 are needed by the data , we performed fits with 2 , 3 and 4 terms as given in tables 1 - 3 and shown in figs . 1 - 3 by the dotted , solid and dashed lines , respectively .    for the analyzing power in dependence of the deuteron scattering angle the latter two are very close together in the angular regions , which are well covered by data . 
 this means that a 3-parameter fit is already appropriate for a proper description of the data . for the lowest energy , where the data are very close to zero throughout the measured angular range , already the 2-parameter fit is sufficient with providng a @xmath51 per degree of freedom ( ndf ) of unity 
 the fact that already a 3-parameter fit is sufficient for an appropriate description of the data in the resonance region is in accordance with the new said solution , which exhibits the @xmath2 pole predominantly in the @xmath10 wave and only very weakly in @xmath11 . 
 hence @xmath45 got to be small and @xmath41 negligible compared to @xmath52 . 
 in fact , the resonance term @xmath52 is highly demanded by the data , as the comparison between dashed and dotted curves demonstrates . since @xmath52 enters also in @xmath40 , the latter 
 is also requested by the fit , whereas @xmath53 turns out compatible with zero within uncertainties at resonance . 
 therefore , the leading contribution to the analyzing power of the @xmath28 angular distribution turns out to be the interference of the resonant @xmath34 wave with the non - resonant @xmath32 wave . 
 .results of the fits to the analyzing power data in dependence of the deuteron scattering angle by use of eq . 
 ( 2 ) with two ( 2p ) , three ( 3p ) and four ( 4p ) terms . [ cols= "" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < "" , ]      +    the @xmath43-dependence of the parameters makes it plausible that the analyzing power is smallest at the lowest energy @xmath25 = 2.34 gev and tends to level off as soon as the resonance maximum is reached . at 2.42 gev the resonance amplitude is already substantially reduced , however , the @xmath43-dependence in @xmath40 and @xmath52 counteracts this reduction .    for the @xmath29 dependence of the analyzing power we may stick with the same ansatz eq . 
 ( 2 ) , but need to reinterpret the transitions ( 4 ) with respect to the partition @xmath54  -  @xmath23 . with still having 
 the @xmath55 system coupled to zero , this means that the transitions @xmath56 and @xmath57 both represent configurations , where the @xmath23 is in relative @xmath32 wave to the @xmath54 system , _ 
 i.e. _ contain also resonance contributions . 
 if we forget the somewhat erratic data point at small angles at @xmath25 = 2.34 gev , then we observe an approximately constant pattern over the energy region of interest , which can be described sufficiently well by already the first two terms in the expansion eq . 
 ( 2 ) .    finally , 
 for the @xmath16 partition we expect relative @xmath4-waves independent of whether this partition originates from @xmath2 or conventional @xmath14-channel excitation , since the considered energies are still below the nominal mass of two @xmath22 excitations . 
 the observed @xmath18 distributions are similar to those for the @xmath54  -  @xmath23 partition and hence characterized dominantly by the @xmath53 contribution .      by using both the unpolarized and polarized runs of this experiment 
 we may extract also ( unpolarized ) differential and total cross sections . 
 this is valuable , since we used in this experiment the quasifree @xmath47 collision in reversed kinematics covering thus the lab system phase space complementary to what has been obtained in regular kinematics used previously @xcite . 
 4 shows the @xmath58 angular dependence of the ( unpolarized ) differential cross section over the energy region @xmath25 = 2.33 - 2.43 gev binned into five intervals . 
 the data plotted by the open circles have been obtained in a previous experiment @xcite by use of a proton beam hitting a deuterium target in quasi - free kinematics . due to the experimental conditions 
 only the deuteron back - angles could be measured in good quality . 
 now , with a deuteron beam impinging on a hydrogen target the phase space in the lab system is populated in a complementary way and we may deduce the cross sections preferably at forward angles ( solid circles ) . note that in fig . 
 4 the data are plotted at angles mirrored to the way plotted in fig .  5 of ref . 
 @xcite . here 
 , in this work , the angles are defined relative to the direction of the initial neutron , whereas in ref . 
 @xcite they have been defined relative to the direction of the initial proton . 
 since we deal here with a purely isoscalar reaction , the unpolarized angular distributions have to be symmetric about @xmath59 in the cms ( barshay - temmer theorem @xcite ) . 
 the data are in very good agreement with this requirement . to underline this , we show in fig . 
 4 fits with an expansion into legendre polynomials of order 0 , 2 , 4 and 6 , _ i.e. _ including @xmath34-waves between d and @xmath55 systems and allowing total angular momenta up to @xmath60 = 3 :    @xmath61    where the coefficients @xmath62 denote the fit parameters . 
 in addition to the symmetry about @xmath59 fig . 
 4 demonstrates that the anisotropy is largest around the maximum of the @xmath2 resonance flattening off below and above . 
 the fact that the angular distribution tends to flatten out towards lower energies is not unexpected , since close to threshold we expect contributions only from the lowest partial waves . 
 the fact that the angular distribution tends to be flatter also at the high energy end of the investigated energy region , is not as trivial . 
 it supports the fact that the high spin @xmath63 = 3 of the @xmath2 resonance requires a unusually large anisotropy of the angular distribution , which is larger than obtained in the conventional @xmath14-channel @xmath16 process , which gets the dominant mechanism at higher energies and where the @xmath16 system may also be in lower angular momentum configurations .

 the data of the first and third measurements have been normalized in absolute height to the value obtained in the second measurement @xcite for @xmath25 = 2.38 gev . within uncertainties 
 the data from all three experiments agree to each other . 
 we have presented the first measurements of the @xmath0 reaction with polarized beam using the quasifree @xmath24 collision process under reversed kinematics . 
 the deduced total cross sections are consistent with previous results . 
 the obtained deuteron angular distributions complement the previous results . 
 they clearly show that at resonance the anisotropy is larger than outside . 
 the measurements exhibit significant analyzing powers in dependence of deuteron and pion angles , which can be understood as being due to the interference of the @xmath2 resonance amplitude with background amplitudes .

28,"one of the most fundamental aspects of the stellar content of galaxies is the distribution by mass of newly formed stars , the initial mass function ( imf ) . 
 evidence supporting or restricting variations in the imf for very low mass stars is of profound importance for an understanding of the mass content of the universe , the dynamical evolution of open and globular clusters , the chemical evolution of galaxies , and the physics of star formation . 
 while developments in star formation theory ( e.g. shu 1991 ) and observations ( e.g. evans 1991 ) continue to increase our understanding of the complexities and processes involved in star formation , any understanding of how the imf does , or does not , depend on environment and metallicity is still elusive . for low mass stars , which are the subject of this paper , large surveys ( see reid & gilmore 1982 ; 
 hawkins & bessell 1988 ; stobie , ishida & peacock 1989 ; bessell & stringfellow 1993 ) have provided a fairly well determined measure of the field star luminosity function near the sun . 
 extensive modelling is required to derive the corresponding stellar initial mass function . 
 however , there is reasonable agreement ( cf . 
 et al . _ 
 1993 and tinney 1995 for recent references ) that the luminosity function shows a broad maximum near @xmath5 , while the underlying mass function ( mf ) breaks away from an approximate power - law increase below 0.5 m@xmath1 . 
 star count surveys in the near - ir ( e.g. hu _ et al . _ 
 1994 ) and in the optical with hst ( bahcall _ et al . _  1994 
 ; santiago , gilmore & elson 1995 ) , and most recently from the hubble deep field ( elson , santiago & gilmore 1996 ) , suggest that the field stars of the galactic thick disk and halo have a luminosity function which is not significantly distinguishable from that of the solar neighborhood down to masses near the hydrogen burning limit . 
 this is a remarkable result , given that these stellar populations differ considerably in local density , and by a factor of forty in mean chemical abundance . 
 field star analyses are , however , subject to many uncertainties , in particular imprecise distance determination ( kroupa _ et al . _ 
 the derivation of an initial mass from a color and apparent magnitude of an object which may be an unresolved binary star of unknown age , distance , and metallicity remains a statistical goal , rather than a precise tool . 
 by contrast , in clusters the primary uncertainties of differential ages , abundances and distances are removed . 
 hence , extensive surveys of the open clusters near the sun have been undertaken ( e.g. pleiades : hambly & jameson 1991 ; hyades : reid 1993 ; praesepe : williams , rieke & stauffer 1995 ; hambly _ et al . _ 
 such clusters are however primarily young , so that interpretation suffers from the limitation that evolutionary models for pre - main sequence stars of low mass are not yet well tested . 
 ideally , one wants clusters older than perhaps 1 gyr , covering a wide range of metallicities .    in the past year 
 there has been a vast improvement in the quality and quantity of data on the low mass end of the stellar luminosity function ( lf ) from observations of globular clusters with the refurbished hst ( e.g.  elson _ et al . _  1995 
 ; de marchi & paresce 1995a , 1995b ; paresce , de marchi & romaniello 1995 ) . 
 these four globular cluster studies have already provided good stellar lfs to @xmath6 ( @xmath2 0.2 m@xmath1 ) , and they will soon be supplemented by at least seven more hst globular cluster studies . in this paper 
 we report deep hst observations of the lfs in two open clusters , which allow us to extend the metallicity range represented by these four globular clusters ( @xmath7 < -0.7 $ ] ) up to solar abundance . thus , for the first time we now have cluster luminosity functions extending to very low stellar masses and covering more than 2 dex in metallicity , and can therefore study the effect of metallicity on stellar luminosity functions . in this paper 
 we search for a systematic dependence of the imf on some parameter to provide clues to the physics of star formation . 
 we observed the open clusters ngc 2477 and ngc 2420 with hst on 1994 march 18 and 1994 may 18/19 , respectively , using the wfpc2 along with the f555w ( approximately v - band ) and f814w ( approximately i - band ) filters . 
 our observations were taken 5.2 arc minutes sw of the cluster center ( 7:38:11.2 + 21:33:09.7 , j2000.0 ) for ngc 2420 and 2.7 arc minutes wsw of the cluster center ( 7:52:16.8 -38:35:40.1 , j2000.0 ) for ngc 2477 to avoid the brightest stars in each cluster . 
 these fields still contain many very bright stars so we obtained the cumulative one hour exposures in each filter from nine 400s exposures in ngc 2477 and four 900s exposures in ngc 2420 . 
 all data were acquired in the same manner and with the same filters , although the operating temperature of the ccds was @xmath8c during the march observations and @xmath9c during the may observations . 
 the temperature change was made in order to decrease a charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) problem which manifested itself as a position - dependent non - linearity of the wfpc2 ccds . 
 the effect was found to be @xmath2 10% at @xmath8c and @xmath2 4% at @xmath9c ( holtzman _ et al . _ 
 1995b ) in a series of 40 second calibration exposures taken of a field in @xmath4 cen . 
 elevated sky counts found in longer exposures such as ours are expected to decrease the cte problem ( holtzman _ et al . _ 
 the lower operating temperature also resulted in far fewer ` hot pixels ' ; pixels with an elevated dark count lasting for hours or days . finally , an additional difference between our two cluster observations is that the sky level for the may data was five times higher than for the march data , owing to zodiacal light differences . 
 the raw data were reprocessed using the iraf / stsdas software with the updated calibration frames that became available subsequent to the observations . 
 this included the standard statistical corrections to the analogue to digital conversion , bias subtraction , dark count subtraction , flat fielding and geometric distortion correction . 
 we also included the non - standard `` ramp correction '' for the march cte problem . 
 the cte properties of the wfpc2 are still not entirely understood , but applying the correction reduced the significance of the cte effect to @xmath2 1% . 
 the cte effect in the may data is expected to be @xmath10 1% because of the higher sky counts and the cooler ccds , so we did not attempt to apply a correction for these data . 
 additionally we spent great effort trying to identify hot pixels as measured in the dark frames taken shortly before or after our observations , but were largely unsuccessful owing to the short life - times of these hot pixels . 
 since hot pixels have counts which are independent of the filter in use , and thus have color equal to zero on the instrumental system , they appear in the same region of the color - magnitude ( cm ) diagram as the faintest white dwarfs . 
 since the wfpc2 ccds are undersampled , hot pixels may appear like faint stars , especially two adjacent hot pixels or single hot pixels next to positive sky fluctuations . 
 hot pixels thus decreased our limiting magnitude for white dwarfs ( von hippel _ et al . _ 
 1995 , hereafter paper i ) , but did not affect the limiting magnitude for the coolest main sequence stars , the subject of this paper . 
 we performed aperture photometry using 1.5 pixel radius apertures with aperture corrections based on a detailed study of the many bright stars available in our fields . 
 after some experimenting we did not employ point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry as our fields were uncrowded and the psf was positionally dependent and not well characterized by our stars . unlike paper 
 i , the photometry was directly transformed to the standard johnson - cousins vi system using the calibration from holtzman _ 
 et al . _  ( 1995b ) . 
 the photometry we present here is thus slightly different from that presented in paper i , but the differences are so small for the white dwarfs as not to modify the results of that study . 
 the cm diagrams for all the stars in the fields of both our clusters , with galaxies removed , are presented in figures 1 and 2 .      in order to characterize the completeness of our photometry we created synthetic stars using the tinytim hst psf generation package ( krist 1994 ) , added these stars to our data , and then tried to recover them using our standard finding and photometry procedure . 
 the synthetic stars were created for both the f555w and f814w filters and were centered at 16 different sub - pixel positions and laid down in a grid of positions covering the whole of each ccd . 
 this sub - pixel sampling was done since the psf locations affect the number of pixels under the psf , and thus the sky noise and read noise contributions per pixel cause the limiting magnitude to depend on the psf sub - pixel position . 
 since this effect is based on noise changing systematically with psf position , it affects completeness , but not the measured magnitudes of objects bright enough to find . 
 the resulting simulated noise - free stars were scaled and had noise added to them to mimic stars over a range of magnitudes . from this procedure 
 we estimated our completeness levels , which are superimposed on figures 1 and 2 . 
 these completeness levels lead to a limiting magnitude @xmath2 0.5 magnitudes brighter than initially expected for the refurbished hst , but this is now understood as due to the ccds leaking some charge between adjacent pixels ( holtzman _ et al . _ 
 these estimates of completeness should be reasonably accurate for the redder stars where hot pixels are not a problem . 
 we outline here the remaining sources of uncertainty in our photometry , although we emphasize that these are all small effects which do not affect our results . 
 \1 ) the cte corrections are almost surely not perfect for the @xmath8c data and they have not been attempted for the @xmath9c data . 
 the resulting uncertainties are @xmath2 1% and do not contribute to any important systematics . 
 \2 ) the hst pipeline flats were taken at the gain=14 setting , whereas our data were taken at the gain=7 setting . 
 the relative gains between these two settings are not identically 2.0 for all ccds . 
 the appropriate gain ratios have been applied , but these are uncertain to @xmath2 1% each . 
 this source of uncertainty should not cause systematic errors since all three wf ccds contain nearly equal portions of the cluster cm diagram . 
 \3 ) the hst pipeline flats are good to a few percent , pixel - to - pixel , over most of the area of the ccds . 
 \4 ) we applied a single aperture correction to all photometry for all wf ccds . 
 in fact the relatively large number of bright but isolated stars in our images allowed us to investigate a number of subtle instrumental effects in the photometry . 
 we performed a number of such tests , and compared them with simulations based on tinytim analytical psfs . 
 the results are described in detail in tanvir , robinson & von hippel ( 1995 ) but briefly they found that ( a ) the photometry is essentially unaffected by the position of the center of the star within a pixel , and ( b ) there is a small ( @xmath113% ) variation seen in the ngc 2477 small aperture photometry which correlates with position on the ccd . 
 this latter effect is probably due to small variations in the psf across each ccd . 
 a similar but not identical effect is seen in the simulations , while ngc 2420 has too few bright stars to show it . 
 however , given that this effect is small , is uncorrelated with magnitude , and to first order affects v and i in the same way , thus leaving v - i colors unchanged , it makes a negligible difference to the results presented here and so no correction was made . 
 \5 ) the precision of the holtzman _ 
 et al . _  ( 1995b ) transformation is expected to be @xmath2 2% , over the applicable color range . 
 the range of applicability of the holtzman _ 
 et al . _  photometric transformations 
 is @xmath12 v - i @xmath13 , whereas our stars continue to v - 
 i @xmath2 3.5 . 
 the expected error for the reddest stars is not large ( see section 3 ) , but this is probably our single greatest systematic uncertainty . 
 \6 ) whitmore ( 1995 ) reports that the hst + wfpc2 throughput increased by 4.1% in f555w and by 0.6% in f814w after cooling the wfpc2 ccds to @xmath9c on 24 april 1994 . 
 et al . _  ( 1995b ) report similar numbers . 
 since the photometric zero points were determined after the ccds were cooled , corrections need to be applied to the earlier data , in our case to ngc 2477 . 
 most of the throughput differences seem to be due to the decrease in the cte problem ( ferguson , private communication ) , however , and since we make a cte correction for our ngc 2477 data , much of this zero point difference probably disappears . 
 the zero point difference between cte corrected data has not yet been determined . 
 we therefore have not applied any throughput correction to the ngc 2477 data . 
 thus , our ngc 2477 data may suffer an additional @xmath2 2 - 5% systematic error in v - i .    from items 1 through 5 above 
 we estimate that the additional random error contributed by the instrument , above and beyond that produced by photon counting statistics , is likely to be 4 - 5% , largely independent of magnitude . 
 item number 5 is relevant to the color magnitude diagrams presented in figures 1a , b and 2a , b as well as to any comparison of these data in the transformed johnson - cousins system to models . it does not affect our analysis of cluster luminosity functions as we compare our data to other hst observations taken through the same filters 
 also , these additional noise sources are not included in the cm diagram error bars , which represent only the internal photon - counting errors and read - noise . 
 in this section we present the cm diagrams for ngc 2420 and ngc 2477 and derive their main sequence lfs . 
 ngc 2420 is metal - poor for an open cluster , with @xmath14 \approx -0.45 $ ] , is only lightly reddened , with a uniform e@xmath15 , and has a distance modulus 11.95 . 
 ages from isochrone fitting for this cluster range from 2.1 gyrs ( carraro & chiosi 1994 ) to @xmath16 gyrs ( anthony twarog _ 
 et al . _ 
 1990 ) and 4 gyrs ( vandenberg 1985 ) . 
 we derived ( paper i ) a lower limit for the age of this cluster from the white dwarfs luminosities of 1.3 gyrs . 
 ngc 2477 is more metal rich , with @xmath14 \approx 0 $ ] , is heavily and unevenly reddened , with an adopted e@xmath17 ( smith & hesser 1983 ; hartwick , hesser & mcclure 1972 ) , and has a distance modulus of about 10.6 . 
 isochrone fitting ages for this cluster range from @xmath18 gyrs ( carraro & chiosi 1994 ) to @xmath19 gyrs ( smith & hesser 1983 ) . 
 we derived ( paper i ) a lower limit on the age of this cluster from the white dwarfs luminosities of 1.3 gyrs . 
 the photometry for ngc 2420 and ngc 2477 is presented in the cm diagrams of figures 1a and 1b , respectively . 
 the photometry has been transformed to the johnson - cousins system and 1 @xmath20 error bars are plotted for all objects . 
 completeness levels derived from our simulations are indicated at the bottom of these figures by the dotted lines . 
 the completeness levels are labeled and correspond to @xmath2 90 , 50 , and 10% completeness . 
 the v - band completeness levels are nearly horizontal , being curved slightly due to the color term in the photometric transformations . 
 likewise the i - band completeness levels are at a near - constant value in i , and thus inclined in this cm diagram . 
 the saturation limits are indicated by the upper dotted lines , level for v and inclined for i. the reddening vector for each cluster is plotted at v @xmath2 22 and v - i @xmath2 0.6 . 
 examination of these figures shows that the main sequence stars and white dwarfs clearly stand out in both clusters , even in the relatively crowded field of ngc 2477 ( which has galactic latitude @xmath21 = @xmath22 ) . 
 it is also evident that the completeness simulations are consistent with the photometric errors and the faint limit of the photometry . 
 figures 2a and 2b present the cluster photometry after the effects of distance and reddening have been removed , and after the removal of the obvious contaminating field stars . 
 the dashed lines are eye - ball fits to the monet _ 
 et al . _  ( 1992 ) trigonometric data for white dwarfs and solar metallicity main sequence stars . 
 they are plotted here to demonstrate that the entire combination of extrapolated photometric transformations , measured distances , and reddenings are reasonable for these clusters . 
 figure 2b presents the fits to the monet _ 
 et al._data placed for e(b - v ) = 0.2 , 0.3 and 0.4 ( left to right ) , since this cluster is known to have variable reddening . 
 contaminating field stars were removed by comparison with nearby fields observed by the hst medium deep survey project . 
 the medium deep survey cm diagrams ( santiago , private communication ) were derived from f606w and f814w photometry , so we used the transformations derived by elson _ 
 et al . _  ( 1995 ) to convert to the johnson - cousins colors . 
 a detailed comparison was then made of the number of stars as a function of magnitude and color in one nearby field for ngc 2420 and two comparable fields for ngc 2477 . 
 the comparison field for ngc 2420 is at _ l , b _ 
 = 206 , + 19.6 , whereas ngc 2420 is at _ l , b _ = 198 , + 19.7 . 
 the comparison field has a similar , and nearly negligible , reddening , e(b - v ) = 0.02 ( burstein & heiles 1982 ) . 
 two comparison fields were used for ngc 2477 since none yet exist which closely match its galactic position and reddening . 
 one field is at _ l , b _ = 85 , 
 -3.5 and has e(b - v ) @xmath3 0.39 , whereas the other is at _ l , b _ 
 = 202 , + 9 and has e(b - v ) @xmath3 0.18 ( burstein & heiles 1982 ) . 
 ngc 2477 is at _ l , b _ 
 = 254 , -5.8 . using this procedure 
 we found it straightforward to isolate the main sequence cluster stars from the contaminating foreground and background stars , most of which lie well away from the main sequences . 
 a few stars in the comparison fields do lie on the cluster main sequences , and thus a small proportion of the stars presented in figures 2a and 2b are expected not to be cluster members . 
 these can only be removed statistically , so no corrections were applied to figures 2a and 2b , though the statistical corrections were applied to the cluster main sequence lfs presented below . before moving on to the extracted cluster lfs , it is worth pointing out that the main sequence in ngc 2420 ( figure 2a ) may actually stop at @xmath23 @xmath2 12 ( @xmath0 @xmath2 9.5 ) , as the fainter stars lie somewhat off the expected main sequence locus . 
 since we argue below that this cluster lf peaks at @xmath23 @xmath2 11.5 ( @xmath0 @xmath2 9.0 ) , for the present purposes we make the conservative assumption that these stars are cluster members . 
 the main sequences lfs for ngc 2420 and ngc 2477 are plotted in figures 3a and 3b . 
 the star symbols are the raw lfs , and the open circles are the lfs corrected for field star contamination and incompleteness . also plotted are lines representing the fractional incompleteness based on our synthetic star simulations . 
 the fractional incompleteness rises from @xmath2 0% at @xmath0 = 10 to nearly 100% by @xmath0 = 11.5 . in all subsequent use of the cluster lfs 
 we include only portions of the lf where incompleteness is less than 25% . 
 the ngc 2420 lf ( figure 3a ) turns over at @xmath0 @xmath2 9.0 while the ngc 2477 lf ( figure 3b ) seems to flatten at @xmath0 @xmath3 9.5 . 
 the numbers of stars in these lfs are small , being only 19 and 53 stars in the complete portion of the lfs for ngc 2420 and ngc 2477 , respectively , so these lf shapes are currently only suggestive . 
 we can estimate the likelihood that the ngc 2420 lf does not turn over by evaluating the probability that the value of the lf in the final bin is actually greater than the identified peak . for ngc 2420 
 a turn - over is a 1.5 @xmath20 result , i.e. there is a 7% chance that this lf continues to rise to its measured limit . 
 the likelihood that the lf continues to rise as rapidly after @xmath0 @xmath2 9.0 as it did before this point is only 1% , however , since the last lf bin lies 2.3 @xmath20 below such an extrapolation . for ngc 2477 a turn - over 
 is not seen , and a flattening is only suggestive . 
 we thus locate the peak in this lf at , or after , @xmath0 = 9.5 . 
 we proceed below to consider the implications of these lf shapes , assuming that they have been correctly determined .    in figure 4 
 we plot our open cluster lfs along with the solar neighborhood lf presented in kroupa _ 
 et al . _  ( 1993 ) and the four published hst globular cluster lfs : @xmath4 cen ( elson _ et al . _ 
 1995 ) , 47 tuc ( de marchi & paresce 1995b ) , m 15 ( de marchi & paresce 1995a ) , and ngc 6397 ( paresce , de marchi & romaniello 1995 ) . the four globular cluster lfs have been shifted down by 1 to 2 units in the log to approximately match the open cluster number counts , for ease of presentation . 
 since all the hst results were obtained using the f814w filter with wfpc2 , we choose to plot the lfs directly in terms of f814w magnitudes , and have therefore transformed the kroupa _ 
 et al . _  ( 1993 ) data first to @xmath0 using the trigonometric parallax data of dahn _ et al . _  ( 1995 ) , and then to @xmath24 . 
 error bars are not plotted here for clarity , but the globular cluster lfs are well determined with typically many hundreds of stars per bin near the lf peak . 
 error bars due to poisson statistics are large for our open cluster data and can be readily determined either in this figure or in figures 3a and 3b by reference to the vertical scale .    in figure 5 we plot the location of the turn - over of all the lfs of figure 4 with respect to their metallicity , measured in [ fe / h ] . 
 the location of a lf turn - over is defined as the location of the peak bin , or for the case of @xmath4 cen , the location of the first bin of the lf flattening . 
 the solar neighborhood value has been placed at [ fe / h ] = @xmath250.2 , representative of this sample ( wyse & gilmore 1996 ) . 
 the abundance distribution of the field stars ( unlike the clusters which each have a single abundance ) blurs any sharp features in its lf , so that the lf maxima discussed here are less precisely defined for the solar neighborhood . 
 the error in the turn - over magnitude for the solar neighborhood is @xmath2 0.25 magnitudes , while the error in the turn - over magnitude for ngc 2420 is larger , @xmath2 0.5 magnitudes . 
 the turn - over magnitude for ngc 2477 is plotted as a lower limit . 
 the internal errors in the turn - over magnitudes for the globular clusters are small because of the large number of stars in each bin . 
 the errors in the turn - over magnitudes are thus likely dominated by the distance uncertainties for these clusters , which are @xmath2 0.2 magnitudes ( e.g. elson _ et al . _ 
 we do not plot the location of the turn - over in the very broad halo field star lf as given by dahn _ 
 _  ( 1995 ) in figure 5 , as the location of this peak is probably more uncertain than the other lf peaks . 
 the essential result which is evident in figure 5 is a smooth and well defined correlation between the location of the turnover of the luminosity function of a stellar sample and the metallicity of that stellar sample . while we discuss explanations of this correlation below , we note here that it bears a close resemblance to a theoretical constant - mass locus . 
 such loci are plotted in figure 5 as dashed lines from the low mass star models of saumon ( private communication ) , for masses @xmath26 and @xmath27 m@xmath1 , and as solid lines from the low mass star models of alexander _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) , for masses @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 m@xmath1 . 
 the saumon models are plotted in @xmath0 , rather than @xmath24 , but the differences are expected to be minor . 
 in the preceding sections we have concentrated on the cluster luminosity functions , not the mass functions , since the derivation of the latter requires additional assumptions . indeed , 
 et al . _  ( 1995 ) , in their analysis of @xmath4 cen , show that even small uncertainties in the mass - luminosity relation are enough to cause major changes in the derived mass function slope . 
 dantona & mazzitelli ( 1996 ) also demonstrate that the faint star lf slope has little to do with the mf slope , or metallicity , as it is driven by the slope of the mass - luminosity relation . while theoretical models for low mass stars are rapidly improving ( see alexander _ et al . _  1996 ; dantona & mazzitelli 1996 ) , a number of difficulties still remain at solar metallicities . 
 we therefore chose not to convert these lfs to mfs , but rather to follow the dominant lf feature , the turn - over , and compare it with stellar models . by following the lf turn - overs we are able to see that all available lfs look essentially the same , especially when corrected for the metallicity of the population . 
 all lfs have approximately the same shape , and each has a turn - over at @xmath30 m@xmath1 
 . why might all lfs have turn - overs at the same mass value , and what physical phenomena might affect the turn - over ? 
 we look at the effects of dynamics , the mass - luminosity relation , and the imf slope in turn . 
 in analyzing their globular cluster luminosity functions , de marchi & paresce ( 1995a , 1995b ) argue that while these three globular clusters have undergone different degrees of core collapse and tidal stripping , their observed lfs are relatively insensitive to the cluster dynamical histories since they were obtained near the cluster half - mass radii . 
 our open cluster observations were also made well inside the radii of tidal stripping , 3 pc from the center of ngc 2420 and 1 pc from the center of ngc 2477 . 
 these distances should be compared to the tidal radius for ngc 2420 , which was determined to be @xmath3 18 pc by leonard ( 1988 ) . 
 the tidal radius for ngc 2477 has not been determined to the best of our knowledge , but these clusters are similar in their stellar density and distance from the galactic center . additionally , although ngc 2420 has a relaxation time of only @xmath2 @xmath31 yrs , it shows only marginally significant mass segregation ( leonard 1988 ) . 
 furthermore , since the globular clusters have a mean stellar density a factor @xmath32 to @xmath33 times higher than the open clusters ( compare the densities of leonard 1988 with those of webbink 1985 ) , and are approximately an order of magnitude older , it would require careful tuning of the dynamical histories of these clusters for low mass stellar evaporation to produce , just at the present time , an uncoordinated set of changes which mimic a systematic dependence on metallicity . in any case , several more globular clusters have been observed with hst , so additional information to check the importance of dynamical evolution , and the true scatter in the correlation of figure 5 , will soon be available . 
 we do not argue that these clusters have not undergone possibly very different dynamical histories , only that their dynamical histories are not the primary cause of the lf turn - overs . 
 the slope of the mass - luminosity ( ml ) relation , in both v and i , is rapidly increasing at masses lower than @xmath30 m@xmath1 , independent of metallicity ( alexander _ et al . _  1996 ; dantona & mazzitelli 1996 ) . 
 metallicity does cause an offset in luminosity at a given mass , but it only slightly affects the slope of the ml relation at a given mass ( alexander _ et al . _ 
 this increase of slope in the ml relation causes a given mass increment to cover a larger and larger absolute magnitude increment , especially below m@xmath34 @xmath2 9.5 - 10 . 
 thus a turn - over in the lf at these magnitudes is naturally explained by the rapidly steepening ml relation . 
 this point was appreciated by kroupa _ 
 et al . _  ( 1993 ) 
 for the solar neighborhood lf , and the theoretical models of alexander _ et al . 
 _  ( 1996 ) and dantona & mazzitelli ( 1996 ) now support this interpretation for all metallicities . 
 a test of this hypothesis is whether these ml relations , when applied to our cluster lfs , yield smooth mfs . 
 when we apply either the observed solar metallicity ml relation of henry & mccarthy ( 1993 ) or the theoretical ml relation of alexander _ et al . _ 
 ( 1996 ) to our lfs , we do indeed find mfs which rise smoothly through the peak and to the completeness limit of the data . 
 this statement can not be made strongly , however , due to the small number of stars in our lfs . 
 we note that our measured mfs rise as n @xmath35 m@xmath36 for both clusters , but that this value for the slope should not be taken too seriously , for the reasons mentioned above with regard to the insensitivity of this procedure to the mf slope , and because of its great dependence on the slope of the ml relation . 
 in fact , dantona & mazzitelli ( 1996 ) demonstrate that a change in the imf slope moves the peak of the lf to a different mass value , by approximately 1 magnitude in the i - band for a change of 0.5 in the mf slope , depending somewhat on metallicity . 
 the lf peak is thus a sensitive measure of the mf slope , and any significant changes in this slope from cluster to cluster would have destroyed the match between the data and the single mass locus seen in figure 5 . 
 the increase in the slope of the ml relation below m@xmath34 @xmath2 9.5 makes a smooth mass function a viable explanation for these cluster lfs . 
 it is therefore unnecessary to invoke the third possibility , a mf kink at @xmath30 m@xmath1 , as the cause of the lf turn - overs . 
 such a mf kink is still possible , since the mf is very poorly determined at lower masses , but it is not _ 
 necessary_.    a complication we have not addressed here is the effect on the actual mf of undiscovered binaries . 
 a large number of stars with masses below @xmath30 m@xmath1 could be hiding as unseen companions of brighter main sequence stars . 
 furthermore , globular clusters , open clusters , and the solar neighborhood field could have different relative numbers of such low mass companions . 
 a detailed analysis of the effect of binarism on luminosity functions was presented by kroupa _ 
 et al . _  ( 1993 ) to which the reader is referred . 
 we conclude that the low mass imf is , to first order , independent of metallicity , with all the systematic changes in luminosity functions with metallicity dominated by the systematic changes in the mass - luminosity relation with metallicity . 
 the implication for star formation is that a large range of initial conditions and environments produce essentially the same distribution by mass of low mass stars . 
 additionally , the low mass mf is not steep enough to provide a large number of essentially invisible main sequence stars ( kroupa _ et al . _

29,"the rationale for , capabilities of , and scientific context of the mid - infrared instrument ( miri ) on jwst are described in rieke et al . 
 ( 2014 ; hereafter paper i ) and the overall optical , thermal , mechanical / structural electronic and control aspects of the design are summarized in wright et al . 
 ( 2014 ; hereafter paper ii ) . 
 this paper describes in more detail the miri medium resolution spectrometer ( mrs ) , which is an integral field unit ( ifu ) spectrometer that covers the wavelength range from 5 to 28.5 @xmath0 m at spectral resolving powers of a few thousand . 
 the mrs consists of 4 channels that have co - aligned fields of view , simultaneously observing the wavelength ranges listed in table 1 with individually optimised ifus , collimators and gratings . 
 section [ sec : optical ] of this paper provides a description of the optical design , including the rationale for choosing the ifu concept and its impact on how observations are carried out . 
 section [ sec : measured ] then describes the expected on - orbit optical performance of the mrs as measured during cryogenic testing , and with a description of the procedure used to construct calibrated spectral data cubes from the raw measured images . 
 the impact of particular characteristics of the mrs , including spectral fringing and straylight are also discussed here . 
 an ifu based design was preferred to a long - slit design for the miri spectrometer for the following reasons . 
 firstly , for point source observations , the need to centre the source in a narrow slit ( via a peak - up procedure ) is relaxed , simplifying and accelerating the target acquisition procedure . 
 there is an additional benefit that there is no loss of light at the slices ( ` slit losses ' in a conventional long slit spectrometer ) . 
 the mrs slice width is set to be less than or equal to the fwhm of the diffraction limited point spread function at the slicing mirror . 
 an equivalent long - slit spectrometer would vignette the light outside this region , losing about 50% of the total . 
 the amount of lost light could be reduced by making the slit wider , but doing so would in turn reduce the spatial and spectral resolution and could also decrease the signal to noise because of increased background radiation . 
 second , from a scientific perspective , the wavelength range covered by the miri spectrometer is sufficiently broad ( a factor of nearly six ) that different emission mechanisms may dominate in different regions of the spectrum . in cases where these mechanisms do not share a common centre ( e.g. , stellar output compared with infrared re - emission in a starburst galaxy ) , a simple slit spectrograph poses a dilemma in placing the `` source '' on the slit . an ifu implements 3d spectroscopy , which solves this problem by giving accurately registered spatially resolved spectroscopy over the entire field . 
 these considerations , combined with the wavelength coverage and resolving power requirements defined by the jwst mission science goals , and the mass , volume and electrical power limitations set by the jwst spacecraft environment , have resulted in a system with the characteristics summarised below and illustrated in block diagram form in figure 1 . 
 as shown in the figure , the full 5 to 28.5 @xmath0 m wavelength range is divided within the spectrometer pre - optics ( spo ) into four simultaneous spectral channels @xcite , each with its own ifu @xcite and using a simple scheme of pass - band separation by dichroic filters whose design is described in hawkins et al . 
 ( 2007 ) and wells et al . 
 we denote the short and long wavelength limits of each channel as @xmath1 and @xmath2 . 
 each channel serves an optimised spectrometer . 
 this separation provides several benefits : ( 1 ) it enables the use of diffraction gratings in first order , allowing each to be used near peak efficiency around the blaze wavelength , and ( 2 ) it also allows the ifu slice widths to be tailored to the wavelength - scaled fwhm in each channel . 
 electrical and thermal constraints limit the mrs to two 1024 x 1024 si : as detectors ( ressler et al . , 2014 , hereafter paper viii ) , resulting in the spectrometer being split into two sets of optics , each with its own detector array , one for the two short - wave channels and one for the two long - wave channels . in each case 
 , the spectra of two wavelength channels are imaged simultaneously onto the left and right halves of a detector array . 
 the product of spatial and spectral coverage that can be achieved in a single instantaneous exposure is ultimately set by the number of detector pixels . for the mrs , 
 this results in a single exposure providing a spectral sub - band that covers only one third of each channel . 
 full wavelength coverage then requires three exposures , with a pair of mechanisms being used to select the gratings and dichroics in each case . 
 we refer to the short and long wavelength limits of each sub - band as @xmath3 and @xmath4 . 
 this design choice allows the grating performance to be optimised over a narrow wavelength range ( @xmath4/@xmath5 @xmath61.2 ) . 
 the gratings only have to work over 20% of the 1@xmath7 order near the blaze wavelength and the dichroics do not have to be used near the cross over between reflection and transmission . 
 we will now step through the optical train as shown in figure 1 : the input optics and calibration ( ioc ) modules pick off the mrs fov from the jwst focal surface and pass it on to the spo . 
 the spo spectrally splits the light into the 4 spectrometer channels and spatially reformats the rectangular fields of view into slits at the entrance of the spectrometer main optics ( smo ) . 
 the smo comprises fixed optics that collimate the light for presentation to diffraction gratings mounted in the spo and then re - images the dispersed spectra onto the two focal plane arrays . 
 key features of this optical system are described individually in the following subsections . 
 the spectral and spatial coverage of the mrs is summarised in table 1 .      the field of view of the mrs is adjacent to the miri imager field and picked off from the jwst focal surface using the miri pickoff mirror ( pom ) , which is common to both ( see paper ii ) . 
 the sky and the jwst pupil are reimaged by the ioc so that there is a pupil image at the spo input and a sky image further on . 
 a cold stop that is 5% oversized with respect to the jwst pupil is placed at the spo input pupil for straylight control . 
 the light is directed towards the first dichroic filter via a fold mirror placed 10 mm beyond the pupil . 
 the focal plane is formed 535 mm beyond the pupil , providing the long path length and narrow beam waist needed between the pupil and the inputs of the four integral field units ( ifus ) , for mounting a chain of dichroics to divide the light among the four spectral channels .    a hole in the fold mirror , sized to be smaller than the footprint of the telescope central obscuration , acts as an aperture for the injection of light from the on - board spectrometer calibration unit ( scu ) , shown in figure 2 . 
 the scu provides spatially and spectrally uniform blackbody illumination for flux calibration and pixel flat fielding functions , using as its light source a tungsten filament heated to a temperature of @xmath61000 k by the application of an 8 ma drive current . 
 the filament is mounted inside a non - imaging flux concentrator that generates spatially uniform focal plane illumination at the exit port of a 25 mm diameter reflective hemisphere , ( described in glasse et al . , 2006 ) . 
 two cadmium telluride lenses within the scu then re - image the exit port onto the ifu input focal planes . the lenses provide a pupil image that coincides with the hole in the input fold mirror . 
 this hole is positioned to lie within the footprint of the central obscuration of the jwst primary mirror and so has no impact on the science beam . in this way 
 , the scu can provide flood illumination of the full mrs field of view without any need for mechanisms or additional optical elements . 
 the overall layout of the dichroic assembly is shown in figure 3 , with the input fold mirror and scu situated at the left - hand end ( but not shown ) . 
 the three dichroics needed to divide the spectral band among the four spectrometer channels for one of the three sub - bands are indicated as d1 , d2 , and d3 in figures 1 and 3 . taking sub - band a as an example , the required reflective band for dichroic d1 is the wavelength range for sub - band a in channel 1 , while its transmission band needs to extend from the short end of sub - band a in channel 2 to the long end of sub - band a in channel 4 . 
 the bands are listed in table 2 for all nine dichroics . in all cases , the mean 
 reflectivity is above 0.95 and the mean transmission is above 0.74 . 
 all of the gratings work in first diffractive order so additional blocking is needed to reject second and higher orders . because the dichroics work in series it is possible to use the combined blocking of dichroics 1 and 2 to remove the need for blocking filters in channels 3 and 4 . for channels 1 and 2 , 
 dedicated blocking is provided by the fixed filters shown as bf1 and bf2 in figure 3 , with light traps lt1 and lt2 absorbing unwanted reflections .    the path length required to reach the input of channel 4 is greater than the 535 mm discussed above , so the light transmitted by the final dichroic is re - imaged via an intermediate focal plane to the entrance of the channel 4 ifu . 
 the 21 mm diameter dichroic filters are mounted on two wheels . 
 first is the nine - sided wheel a containing the three channel 1 dichroic filters and three flat mirrors to direct the light towards channel 1 . the second , six - sided wheel , contains the six dichroics needed to divert the light into channels 2 and 3 . 
 each dichroic filter is mounted onto a diamond machined facet on the wheel that provides the required alignment accuracy and reduces the magnitude of any print - through of surface form errors from the wheel to the filter substrate . 
 the filters are held in place with a spring loaded bezel with a clear aperture of 17 mm compared with the coated area of 17.4 mm . 
 the bezel prevents light from reaching the uncoated area of the filter , which might result in un - filtered light entering the optical path . 
 the blocking filters are mounted directly to the spo chassis with a stand and bezel , similar to the mounting arrangement for the wheels . 
 the mechanisms that carry the dichroic wheels also carry the corresponding wheels with diffraction gratings for each sub - band ( three per channel ) , as discussed in section 2.4 . by arranging for the gratings to be mounted on the same mechanisms as their band - selecting dichroics , 
 the number of moving mechanisms within the mrs is kept to two .      before the light in the four channels reaches the gratings it is sliced and reformatted by the integral field units and 
 so we describe these next . 
 the parameters pertaining to the spatial and spectral coverage and sampling of the spectrometer , which are largely determined by the design of the four ifus , are given in table 1 . 
 spatially , the image is sampled in the dispersion direction by the ifu slicing mirrors and in the slice direction by the detector pixels . 
 spectrally , the width of the slices defines the spectrometer entrance slit and the width of the image ( in pixels ) of the slice at the detector defines the width of the spectral sample . 
 inspection of table 1 then shows that channels 1 to 3 are all slightly undersampled spectrally , with slice widths less than 2 pixels at the detector . 
 the bandwidths of the spectral channels listed in table 1 were chosen such that the ratio @xmath8/@xmath1 in all four channels was the same : @xmath2/@xmath9 ( 28.3 / 5)@xmath10 1.54 . 
 this means that , if each channel is assigned the same number of spectral pixels , the resolving power in each will be approximately the same . 
 each sub - band then has a width that is slightly larger than one third of the band - width of its parent channel , where the excess provides sufficient overlap of adjacent spectra to allow their concatenation . in practice , the overlap is typically 10 to 15% of the spectral range , depending on the specific sub - bands and position in the field of view .    for full nyquist sampling of the telescope 
 psf the four ifu slice widths should ideally be matched to the half width at half maximum intensity of the psf at the shortest wavelength in each channel . 
 for the jwst telescope pupil this would equate to a@xmath11 0.088 ( @xmath12 / 5 @xmath0 m ) arcsec . 
 however , the large increase in the beam size produced by diffraction at the ifu slicer mirror would then necessitate large apertures for the spectrometer optics to avoid vignetting . to control the size , mass and optical aberrations of the spectrometer , the starting point for determining the slice widths was therefore to set them equal to 2a@xmath13 , with fully sampled psfs to be achieved using two or more pointings of the telescope . 
 optimum spatial sampling , which minimises the number of telescope pointings needed to fully sample all four channels simultaneously in the across - slice direction , is achieved by having a single pointing offset equal to n@xmath14 + 1/2 slice widths for all channels where n@xmath14 is a different integer for each channel . 
 this led us to adopt a set of slice widths that follow a scheme where the slices are factors of 1 , 11/7 , 11/5 and 11/3 wider than the narrowest 0.176 arcsec slice . 
 these values closely match the increasing fwhm of the psf in the 4 channels and allow full nyquist sampling to be achieved using a single ` diagonal ' offset whose magnitude in the across slice direction is equal to 11/2 times the width of the narrowest slice ( 0.97 arcseconds ) and ( n + 1/2 ) detector pixels in the along slice direction ( where n is an integer ) . with 
 these slice widths fixed the design was interated to , as far as possible , meet the following criteria : 1 . ) 
 each channel would occupy half a 1024 x 1024 pixel detector with borders to allow for tolerances in alignment and gaps between slices to avoid crosstalk ; 2 . ) 
 the fov of each channel should be as large as possible and approximately square ; and 3 . ) 
 the long and short wavelength arms of the spectrometer should be identical ( in practice one is the mirror image of the other ) . 
 this iteration resulted in the parameters in table 1 . 
 the ifu design was developed from the ifu deployed in uist , a 1 - 5 @xmath0 m spectrometer for ukirt @xcite . 
 other examples of all - reflecting image slicers are the spectrometer for infrared faintfield imaging ( spiffi ) @xcite , and the slicer in the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) @xcite . 
 the miri ( and uist ) ifu design allows excellent control over stray light by providing through - apertures for baffling . 
 it consists of an entrance pupil , an input fold mirror , an image slicer mirror , a mask carrying exit pupils for the individual sliced images , a mask carrying slitlets for the individual images , and an array of re - imaging mirrors behind the slitlets . these components ( except for the last ) are shown in figure 4 . 
 the design is all - reflecting and constructed entirely of aluminium , and hence is well - suited for operation in the infrared and at cryogenic temperatures , as discussed in paper ii . 
 @xcite describe the manufacture of the slicer . 
 the optical path through the ifus begins with the four toroidal mirrors , which comprise the anamorphic pre - optics ( apo ) module , ( not shown in figure 4 ) . 
 the apo re - images an area of up to 8 by 8 arcseconds of the input focal plane onto the image slicer mirror , with anamorphic magnification . 
 the image slicer ( at the relayed image plane ) consists of a stack of thin mirrors angled to divide the image along the dispersion direction of the spectrometer into separate beams . in the across slice ( dispersion ) direction one slice width 
 is matched to the fwhm of the airy pattern at the shortest operating wavelength for the ifu . in the along slice direction 
 the magnification is chosen to provide the required plate scale at the detector . 
 these two magnifications are not the same and so the apo exit pupil is elliptical , as illustrated in figure 5 for channel 3 , where the footprint of the jwst pupil is shown in blue . 
 the light exits the ifu through individual pupil masks for each beam , then through individual slitlets ( see figure 4 ) . 
 re - imaging mirrors behind the slitlets relay the beam to the input of the appropriate spectrometer . 
 that is , each ifu takes the rectangular fov and transforms it into a pattern of slitlets ( as shown in figure 4 ) that are re - imaged onto the entrance aperture for its corresponding grating spectrometer . 
 the slicing mirror comprises a number of spherical optical surfaces , diamond turned onto a common substrate . 
 this manufacturing approach was used previously for the ifu in gnirs @xcite . 
 figure 6 is a photograph of the image slicer for channel 1 , which has 21 slicer mirrors arranged about the centre of the component with 11 slices on one side and 10 on the other . 
 each mirror is offset to direct its output beam towards the corresponding re - imaging mirror . 
 the design for channels 2 to 4 is similar but with correspondingly fewer and larger slices as the wavelength increases , as listed in table 1 . 
 the mirrors are arranged in a staircase - like manner to aid manufacturing . 
 each of the slices re - images the ifu entrance pupil at a scale of @xmath151:1 and because the centres of curvature of the mirrors are offset laterally with respect to each other , the pupils that the slices produce are separated , as can be seen in figure 4 . 
 the slicing mirrors truncate the anamorphically magnified image of the sky along the dispersion direction , as shown in figure 7 ( a ) to ( c ) . 
 this truncation results in the pupil image being diffraction broadened in the dispersion direction as shown in figure 7 ( d ) . to reduce vignetting , the baffle at this pupil image and subsequent optical components ( including the diffraction gratings ) 
 are oversized . 
 this is illustrated in figure 7(d ) where the geometric footprints for 3 field positions are overlaid along a slice to appear as the blurred green patch in the image . 
 the notional , geometric pupil is shown in red and the oversized mask aperture is shown as a green rectangle . 
 the re - imaging mirror array forms images of the slicing mirrors as input slits of the spectrometer and also images the pupils at infinity , making the output telecentric . 
 finally , a roof mirror redirects light from the re - imaging mirrors so that the output consists of the two lines of staggered slitlets relayed from those seen in figure 4 . 
 a slotted mask at the position of the ifu output slits defines the field of view along the individual slices , while in the spectral direction the slots are oversized to ensure they do not vignette the image , but still act as baffles to reduce scattered light between the slices . 
 the numbers of detector columns covered by the four ifus are approximately 476 , 464 , 485 , 434 for channels 1 to 4 respectively . 
 the size of the gap between individual slits for channel 1 is set to be approximately equal to the diameter of the first dark diffraction ring in the telescope psf , ( about 4 pixels ) . for channels 2 
 4 the size of the gap is slightly greater than the diameter of the first dark ring . 
 the smo ( whose layout is shown in figure 8) , comprises four grating spectrometers in two arms . 
 the development and test of these spectrometers are described by @xcite . 
 each of them performs three functions : collimation of the telecentric output beams of one of the four ifus , dispersion of the collimated beam , and imaging of the resulting spectrum onto one half of one of the two focal plane arrays . 
 one of the two spectrometer arms includes the two short wavelength channels ( 1 and 2 ) , and the other the long wavelength channels ( 3 and 4 ) . 
 we will now step through the optical path from the ifus to the detectors . 
 the ifu output beam for each channel is collimated and its light directed towards the corresponding diffraction gratings as shown in figure 9 . 
 each spectrometer arm uses 6 gratings ( two wavelength channels , three sub - band exposures ) . 
 figure 8 then shows the optical paths from the gratings to the detectors . 
 the dispersed beams are imaged by three - mirror - anastigmat ( tma ) camera systems ( m1-m2-m3 ) . in each spectrometer arm 
 the channels have separate , but identical , m1 camera mirrors that provide intermediate images of the spectra between m1 and m2 . 
 folding flats at these intermediate focus positions reflect the channel 1 and channel 4 beams such that the combined ( ch . 
 1 + 2 ) and ( ch . 3 + 4 ) beam pairs are imaged onto opposite halves of the detectors by common m2 and m3 mirrors . 
 the symmetry through the centre plane of the camera optics and the positioning of the optics allow for an opto - mechanical design of two mirror - imaged boxes , with identical optics and almost identical structures . 
 the combination of symmetry and an all aluminium design ( optics as well as structures ) allowed the very strict alignment and stability requirements to be met fully with an adjustment - free mounting ( i.e. positional accuracy by manufacturing accuracy only except for the focus shim at the detector interface ) , a major advantage regarding the total design , manufacture and test effort . 
 the mirror substrates are all light - weighted aluminium with diamond turned optical surfaces that are gold coated for maximum reflectivity at the miri operating wavelengths . 
 they are mounted through holes in the housing walls using stress - relieving lugs under light - tight covers to prevent any high temperature radiation from the instrument enclosure ( at @xmath640 k ) reaching the detectors . 
 the two sets of gratings for the a , b and c sub - bands of the two channels are mounted on a single wheel , as shown in figure 10 , that is mounted on a mechanism that also carries the dichroics wheel on a lower level . 
 the mechanisms are located in the spo and each mechanism is rotated by a single actuator to give the correct combination of dichroics and gratings across all channels for each exposure . the gratings are master rulings on aluminium substrates and are gold coated . 
 table 3 lists the design parameters of the gratings . 
 all gratings operate in first order . 
 the angular values quoted in figure 1 are calculated for the ( virtual ) nominal input beam , originating from the centre of the ifu output area . 
 the spo is designed to be a well baffled optical system . to intercept stray light from the telescope 
 the first optical element in the mrs is a cold stop placed at the entrance pupil . 
 a number of features within the mrs help to control stray light : 1 . ) stops at each pupil and sky image in the optical train ; 2 . ) 
 light traps where significant stray light occurs ( 0@xmath16 order from the gratings ) ; 3 . ) 
 labyrinths at the edges of apertures between modules and tight control of all external apertures , e.g. electrical feed throughs ; 4 . ) 
 black coating of all surfaces not in the main optical path , which is an inorganic black anodising applied to a roughened surface of aluminium . 
 the process was carried out by protection des metaux , paris ; and 5 . ) 
 avoidance of surfaces at grazing incidence near the main optical path . 
 in addition , for each slice of each ifu there are output pupil and slit masks . 
 all the diamond turned aluminium mirrors in miri were specified to have a surface roughness of < 10 nm rms . 
 this results in a total integrated scatter per surface of < 0.06% ; non - sequential optical modelling indicated that this level of scatter should not significantly degrade the psf of the mrs . 
 all mirrors have an overcoated gold surface with reflectivity > 98.5% in the miri wavelength range . 
 straylight analysis shows that the extensive baffling combined with the low scattering optical surfaces and blackened structure should reduce unwanted light ( cross talk between channels , degraded psf and out - of - beam light at the output image ) to levels that are estimated to be less than 0.1% of the background radiation included in the science beam . 
 due to the nature of an ifu spectrograph with its slicing and dispersing optics , the resulting detector images are not straightforward to analyze : spatial , spectral , and with it photometric information , are spread over the entire detector array . 
 further , the gratings are used in an optically fast , non - littrow conguration . 
 the resulting anamorphic magnification varies from the short to long wavelength limit for each sub - band which , when combined with the curved spectral images of the dispersed slices on the detector as shown in figure 11 , makes the optical distortion significant and complex . 
 the anamorphic and slicing optics add other components of distortion that vary the plate scale in the along - slice direction for each slice individually . 
 this leads to a very complicated variation of the spatial plate scales and finally to a dependency of the spatial and spectral axes on each other and on the location on the detector array .    to enable scientific studies 
 based on mrs data , the flux measured in each detector pixel needs to be associated with a wavelength and location on the sky . 
 since the ifu provides two spatial dimensions , each detector pixel corresponds to a position within a three - dimensional cube with two spatial and one spectral dimension . 
 due to the optical distortion , the edges of these cubes are neither orthogonal nor constant in length . 
 consequently , we have developed a process ( called image or cube reconstruction ) , which allows a transformation of the detector pixels onto orthogonal cubes . 
 cube reconstruction requires a thorough understanding of the optical distortion . 
 it is not possible to just characterize the curved images of the dispersed slices ( as shown in the left plot of figure 11 ) by approximating the curvature with polynomial functions . due to the distortion caused by the slicing optics , the spatial plate scale varies within a slice non - uniformly . 
 the characterization of the plate scale and the association of each detector pixel with its projected location on the sky at any given wavelength is a task for the astrometric and wavelength calibration , described in the next sections . 
 once the sky - coordinates and wavelength are known for each detector pixel , the cube can be reconstructed as discussed by glauser et . 
 2010 ) .      to describe the optical distortion on the image plane of the detectors we began from the optical model , using ray - tracing techniques to project each detector pixel through the slicing optics backwards onto the sky . 
 when the as - built geometry was taken into account , we achieved a high spatial accuracy , as demonstrated for the miri verification model ( glauser , et al . , 2010 ) . 
 to verify this approach , a dedicated astrometric calibration campaign was conducted during the instrument test campaign of the miri flight model .    as outlined in glauser et al . 
 ( 2010 ) , the intra - slice spatial distortion can be approximated with a 2@xmath17 order polynomial to accuracies of a few milli - arcseconds - much better than required for the astrometric accuracy given the minimum plate scale of 0.196 arcseconds in the along - slice direction for channel 1 . 
 we conducted the astrometric calibration by placing a broad - band point source at three field positions for each slice and each channel and recording the dispersed signature on the detector . 
 the central pixel of the spatial profile was determined and correlated with the known position of the point source ( our reference on the sky ) . with this method 
 we were able to determine the spatial plate scale at any location on the detector . due to limitations of the test setup , i.e. , strong field distortion of the steerable point - source , 
 the achievable relative astrometric accuracy was very limited . 
 however , within an estimated upper limit of @xmath60.5 pixels ( 0.098  arcsecond for channels 1 and 2 , 0.123  arcsecond for channel 3 , and 0.137  arcsecond for channel 4 ) , the approach of using the optical model for the reconstruction was validated . 
 a further result from this calibration campaign was the measurement of the fov for each sub - band . 
 figure 12 shows the mrs fov in the jwst coordinate frame and its position relative to the imager field . 
 the fov common to all mrs channels is 3.64  arcsec in the along - slice ( @xmath18 and 3.44  arcsec in the across - slice direction ( @xmath19 .      to determine the absolute wavelengths for the mrs channels we conducted a series of calibration measurements during the instrument test campaign . 
 fabry - prot etalon filters were used to create a dense pattern of unresolved spectral lines on the detector . 
 many tens of lines were typically visible at a signal to noise ratio of more than 50 in a single sub - band exposure . 
 an example etalon measurement is shown in figure 13 . to provide a reference wavelength to distinguish between adjacent etalon lines , the telescope simulator used in the test 
 was also equipped with a pair of ` edge ' filters , one of which cut - on at around @xmath20 6.6 @xmath0 m ( in sub - band 1c ) and the other which cut off at @xmath21 21.5 @xmath0 m ( in sub - band 4b ) . 
 the absolute wavelengths of the etalon lines and edge filters had previously been measured at ambient and 77 k temperatures using a laboratory standard fourier transform spectrometer with a spectral resolving power of r @xmath22 100,000 . 
 the extrapolation of the wavelength scale to the 34 k operating temperature for the test campaign was based on published measurements ( browder and ballard , 1969 , browder and ballard , 1972 and smith and white , 1975 ) . 
 this extrapolation resulted in a typical wavelength correction of less than 1% of the width of the mrs spectral resolution element . 
 the repeatability of the scale after multiple mechanism reconfigurations has been measured to be 0.02 resolution elements . 
 the wavelength calibration process then involved the assignment of an absolute wavelength to an etalon line by fitting the calibrated spectra of the edge filters to their mrs measured spectra in sub - band 1c and 4b . 
 the known separation of the etalon lines was used to extend the wavelength scale across the full spectral image in each of these sub - bands . to extend the scale to other sub - bands , pairs of measured etalon spectra 
 were co - added and the positions of unique identifying features ( due to spectral beating between the two patterns ) were used . 
 a set ( 2 per sub - band ) of second order polynomial fits to the positions of the etalon lines was used to generate a wavelength value for the corners of all illuminated pixels . 
 the wavelength calibration derived in this way was encoded for use in the mrs calibration pipeline by forming six images ( one for each mrs detector and all three grating wheel settings ) where the image signal values were set equal to the wavelengths at the corner of each detector pixel . 
 we note that as a result , these wavelength reference images have one more row and column than the detector images . 
 the relative accuracy of this wavelength scale ( within and between sub - bands ) is estimated to be better than 0.02 spectral resolution elements which , for example , corresponds to 0.03 nm at @xmath21 5 @xmath0 m . 
 the absolute accuracy of the wavelength scale is estimated to be comparable to this figure but this will need to be confirmed during on - orbit commissioning using spectral standards . 
 the wavelength calibrated etalon spectra were also used to measure the spectral resolving power of the mrs . 
 the results are shown in figure 14 , where the sub - band averaged values are shown in red and the spread of values seen across the field of view is indicated by the black band . 
 we note that figure 14 does not take account of the intrinsic spectral width of the etalon features , which was determined using the r @xmath22 100,000 calibrated spectra , described above . 
 initial efforts to deconvolve the intrinsic line profiles from the mrs measured spectra suggest that the resolving powers quoted in figure 14 may be underestimated by around 10 % . 
 we have therefore used the band averaged measurements scaled by a factor 1.1 to generate the summary values quoted in table 1 .      as outlined in section [ sec : optical ] , the psf of the mrs is under - sampled by design , with full sampling in both spatial and spectral dimensions requiring that the object be observed in at least two dither positions that include an offset in the across - slice direction of 11/2 times the channel 1 slice width ( which corresponds to 7/2 slices in channel 2 , 5/2 slices in channel 3 , and 3/2 slices in channel 4 ) . due to the curved shape of the distorted spectrum on the detector and the variable plate scale along the individual slices , 
 the exact dither offset in the along - slice direction is less well determined ( but also less critical ) . 
 figure 15 shows the nominal mrs dither pattern to be used in a single observation to sample point sources fully , as derived during test campaigns , and as proposed for in - flight operations .    to achieve a fully sampled psf 
 , these dithered observations must be combined . 
 we anticipate that this could most readily be achieved using the reconstructed cubes . 
 to avoid loss of spatial resolving power caused by any shift- and co - adding algorithm due to the re - binning of the data ( for example , fruchter & hook , 2002 ) , we minimize the necessary re - binning steps by incorporating dither offsets parallel to the slice into the reconstruction algorithm itself . 
 this has the advantage that only one re - binning step is required from detector data to reconstructed cubes , while dither offsets in the across slice direction can be corrected and combined afterwards using an interlacing method . 
 we expect more sophisticated techniques than we have developed so far to be incorporated into the data reduction pipeline before launch . 
 we attempted to measure the mrs psf during flight model testing at ral using the miri telescope simulator ( mts ) , described in paper ii . 
 however , optical aberrations and vignetting in the mts led to the generated point source being elongated and extended at short wavelengths , such that it did not provide a sufficiently point - like image . even at longer wavelengths , where aberrations became less apparent as diffraction started to dominate , 
 the measured psf was broader than nominal due to vignetting in the telescope simulator . 
 we therefore repeated the psf measurement on the flight model during the first cryo - vacuum test campaign at nasa - goddard ( cv1rr ) , where a compact and well defined point source was available . 
 deep exposures at 17 different locations in the mrs field were combined and reconstructed to form the psf image for channel 1a , shown in figure 16 . for these data , 
 the spectral coverage was limited to a narrow ( 0.125 @xmath0 m wide ) wavelength range around 5.6  @xmath0 m . 
 a comparison with the model psf ( pure diffraction limited fourier - transformed jwst pupil ) shows a very good match across the slices . in the along - slice direction , a broadening of approximately 50% 
 is observed . 
 currently , possible causes considered for the broadening include scattering in the detector substrate ( the detector halo effect , which is also observed in the imager and is discussed in rieke et al . , ( 2014 , paper vii ) or a side - effect of the straylight discussed in section [ subsec : mylabel6 ] . in the case of the halo effect , 
 the larger degree of broadening seen in the mrs may be due to the larger spatial sample per pixel . 
 more detailed modelling is required to confirm the root cause . 
 spectral fringes are a common characteristic of infrared spectrometers . they originate from interference at plane - parallel surfaces in the light path of the instrument . 
 these surfaces act as fabry - prot etalons , each of which can absorb light from the source signal with a unique fringe pattern . in the infrared wavelength range , surfaces separated by a fraction of a mm up to a few cm may form very efficient etalons . the most obvious source of fringes in the mrs is the detector itself with a physical thickness of 500 @xmath0 m ( paper vii ) . 
 similar fringes have also been observed in spectra measured with the miri verification model during testing and with the spitzer - irs instrument , which employs comparable ( though smaller ) si : as bib detectors , lahuis & boogert ( 2003 ) .    for the initial analysis we follow the formalism 
 as defined in kester et al . , ( 2003 ) and lahuis & boogert , ( 2003 ) . 
 the sine approximation , @xmath23 _ _ cos(2__@xmath24 _ _ sin(2__@xmath25 , is used with @xmath26 being the wavenumber and @xmath27 the optical thickness of the instrument component . 
 of primary interest to help in the identification and first characterization of the fringes is the optical thickness @xmath27 . in the mrs test data three distinct fringe components 
 are seen , with key parameters listed in table 4 .    of the three fringe components two 
 are directly matched to optical components in the instrument . 
 the main fringe component ( # 1 in table 4 ) has a derived optical thickness of approximately 3.5 mm for all sub - bands . 
 this corresponds to the optical thickness of the detector substrate which has d @xmath6 500 @xmath28 m and n @xmath6 3.42 , giving d @xmath6 0.34 cm . 
 figure 17 gives an illustration of this fringe pattern , showing the main detector and dichroic fringes in more detail for channel 4 . 
 the optical thickness derived for the second , high frequency , component ( d @xmath6 2.7 cm ) is matched to that of the cdte dichroic filters ( section 2.2 ) . for the third set of low frequency components ( d = 0.01 to 0.1 cm ) , 
 no unique surfaces in the instrument are identified ; instead these are likely to originate from beating between primary fringe components . 
 the fringe variations come from the layered structure of the detector substrate and optical thickness differences between individual dichroic filters . 
 figure 18 shows the peak normalized fringes over the entire wavelength range of the mrs . 
 the two curves in figure 18 show predictions for the expected fringe amplitudes based on representative anti - reflection ( ar ) coating profiles as applied to the miri flight detectors . 
 the solid curve assumes a pure two - sided etalon while the dashed - dotted curve simulates a back - illuminated surface with a fully reflective front surface and photon absorption in the active layer ( adopted from woods et al . , 2011 ) . 
 though not a perfect match , this approximate detector model does reproduce the general trend and magnitude of the fringes . 
 fringe removal will be achieved using the techniques developed for and applied to iso and spitzer data ( see lahuis & van dishoeck , 2000 ; kester et al . , 2003 ; lahuis & boogert , 2003 ) . 
 this involves dividing the observed spectra by a fringe flat - field followed by the removal of fringe residuals using the sine fitting method . 
 this approach has proven to be reliable and robust for most spectra and the experience with iso and spitzer has shown that it allows the removal of fringe residuals down to the noise level . 
 the main limitations with this technique are the definition of the spectral continuum in the presence of spectral features and isolating the fringe spectrum from broad molecular ( vibration-)rotation bands ( e.g. those of c@xmath29h@xmath29 , hcn , co@xmath29 and h@xmath29o ) .    for the miri ifu 
 other effects play a role and may limit the fringe removal for point and compact source measurements . 
 the two major effects are ; i ) the illumination ( and its effective angle ) on the detector depends on the source morphology ( position and extent ) and ii ) the wavelength depends on the spatial location of the point source in the ifu field . 
 this results in i ) changes in the effective optical thickness from source to source and ii ) a wavelength shift with spatial offset . 
 both modify the detailed fringe pattern for individual cases . 
 figure 19 illustrates this with point source measurements from the cv1rr test campaign and using extended source blackbody spectra from flight model testing at ral . 
 small sub - pixel pointing offsets are seen to have a discernable impact on the fringe pattern . 
 these effects can be mitigated by traditional fringe removal techniques using optimized and iterative reduction algorithms ( e.g. by modifying , shifting and stretching the reference fringe spectrum before applying it ) . 
 this has been used in individual iso and spitzer cases and the miri team will work on developing optimized methods for the mrs . for miri 
 an alternative model - based approach is also under study which uses the observed source morphology to define the fringe spectrum . 
 this method will be applicable to both the mrs and the lrs , and will complement the traditional fringe removal techniques . 
 this requires both a well - defined and well - calibrated fringe model ( an ongoing miri team activity ) and a flexible and iterative reduction pipeline ( in development at stsci based on input from the miri team ) . 
 we determined the pixel - to - pixel variation of the response for both short and long wavelength detectors , using measurements taken during testing at ral . 
 the illumination was provided by an external , extended source in the mts . 
 a number of exposures measured over the period of the whole test run and covering the full mrs wavelength range were included in this calculation . 
 we first de - fringed the data using the prescription described in section [ subsec : spectral ] , with the results illustrated in figure 17 . 
 we then calculated the mean value of each pixel , @xmath30 , by averaging over 5 x 5 pixel boxes centered on pixel ( @xmath31 and accounting for pixels close to the edges of the slices or near bad pixel clusters . 
 the original data were then divided by these averaged values to create a map of the normalized pixel gain . 
 we checked the distribution of the pixel - to - pixel variation for each exposure in all the available data for both detectors and all the sub - bands and found that the distribution is gaussian with a full - width - half - maximum of @xmath62% ( figure 20 ) . 
 the variation among different datasets has a standard deviation of @xmath32 0.2% for 16 different observations . 
 the pixel - to - pixel variation does not appear to be wavelength dependent as both short and long wavelength detectors show the same overall flatness . 
 this uniformity suggests that the correction of pixel response variations on orbit can be achieved using infrequent calibration measurements . 
 the absolute responsivity of the mrs is expressed in terms of the quantity referred to as the photon conversion efficiency ( pce ) , which is equal to the number of electrons detected by the focal plane array for each photon incident at the miri entrance focal plane . 
 the wavelength - dependent pces for the mrs were derived during testing at ral . 
 this was done by configuring the mts to provide extended illumination of the miri entrance pupil with the spectral energy distributions of blackbodies of 400 , 600 and 800 kelvin . for each mts blackbody configuration , 
 mrs spectra were obtained in all 12 spectral bands , together with background measurements using the blank position in the mts filter wheel . 
 the data were processed using the standard dhas tool ( paper ii ) , which converts the raw readouts of the integration ramps to slopes in physical units ( electrons / sec ) . 
 the dhas miricube module , which performs the reconstruction technique described in section [ subsec : mylabel4 ] , was then used to construct spectral cubes from the slope images , re - gridding the focal plane array pixel signals onto an equidistant spectral cube . 
 the spectral cubes of the background measurements ( mts filter blank position ) were subtracted from the flood illumination measurements to correct for the test facility background . 
 the spectral cubes produced with the dhas miricube routine have a fully calibrated wcs with the plate scale and wavelength coverage of every cube pixel . when combined with an estimate for the absolute flux delivered to the entrance focal plane by the mts ( paper ii ) , this allows us to calculate the photon conversion efficiency in every pixel of the spectral cube for all mrs spectral bands . 
 table 5 lists the mean pces for all mrs bands . 
 we estimate the fractional error to be 20 % in these figures , due to systematic effects , primarily in estimating the absolute flux from the mts . 
 one obvious feature of table 5 is the sharp drop in pce from channel 3 to channel 4 . 
 the pce in channel 4 is roughly a factor of 2.5 lower than was expected from sub - system measurements of the nominal mrs optical train . 
 the extra loss was identified ( m. te plate , esa , private communication ) as being caused by a fault in the groove profiles of the channel 4 gratings , which can not be corrected before launch . 
 following the procedure to determine the photon conversion efficiency , we can establish a first spectrophotometric calibration . by comparing the flux conversion factors derived from blackbody measurements of the mts at 400 , 600 and 800k 
 , we can assess the achievable spectrophotometric calibration accuracy . 
 figure 21 shows the ratios of the different obtained flux conversion factors as a function of wavelength . 
 we are encouraged by the good agreement ( less than 2 % variation ) over a large swathe of the mrs wave - band .      as described in sections 2.3 and 2.5 , 
 great care was taken to minimise sources of straylight and optical cross - talk within the mrs ifus . 
 however , a source of straylight was detected during ral testing , which was identified as being caused by scattering in optical components within the smo . 
 the stray light is manifested as a signal that extends in the detector row direction . 
 its magnitude is proportional to that of bright illuminated regions of the spectral image , at a ratio that falls with increasing wavelength , from about 2 % in channel 1a to undetectably low levels longward of channel 2b . 
 [ fig23 ] emphasises the impact of the straylight in channel 1b , using the wavelength - averaged , reconstructed image of a bright source ( seen at the top - left ) . 
 the straylight signature is seen as the two horizontal bands , where the variation in brightness with the ` alpha ' coordinate is well explained by the mapping between alpha and detector row coordinate . 
 the development of algorithms for correction of this straylight is underway . 
 they take advantage of the stray - light being the dominant signal in the inter - slice regions of the detector , thereby making it amenable to accurate characterisation . 
 initial indications ( figure 22 ) suggest that an effective correction algorithm will be available before launch . 
 testing at ral revealed a gap in the performance of the train of dichroics described in section 2.2 . 
 the set of filters that define the pass - band for channel 3 , sub - band a , have an unwanted ( but small ) transmission peak at a wavelength of 6.1 @xmath0 m , which allows light in the second diffraction order to reach the detector at the position where 12.2 @xmath0 m light is detected in the first diffraction order . 
 this leak was confirmed using fabry - prot etalon data and characterised to produce the leak profile plotted in figure 23 . 
 this curve can be interpreted as the transmission profile by which the 6.1 @xmath0 m spectrum of a target object should be multiplied to determine the leakage signal at 12.2 @xmath0 m . 
 there are two options for mitigating the effects of the spectral leak . 
 first , the channel 3a spectrum can be corrected by multiplying an observation of the 6.1 @xmath0 m ( channel 1b ) spectrum of the target object by the leak profile , resampling the wavelength scale of the resulting spectrum to the wavelength grid of channel 3a and then subtracting it from the contaminated channel 3a spectrum . 
 this requires that a separate channel 1b observation has been taken . 
 the second method would be to make the channel 3a observation with dichroic wheel 1 set to use the sub - band c dichroics ( see section 2.2 to see what this means in terms of the optical train ) . 
 this combination of dichroics reduces the spectral leak by a factor of more than 1000 at @xmath33 = 6.1 @xmath28 m . 
 the unwanted side - effect of this solution is up to a factor of three loss of pce at the short wavelength ends of channel 2a and channel 4a . 
 we have presented the key parameters that describe the performance of the miri mrs spectrometer as designed or measured , in a form that both provides our best estimate of the behaviour of the instrument on - orbit and also that is accessible to the prospective user . 
 the optical design behind the parameters is presented at a level of detail that is intended to provide the astronomer with an understanding of what to expect in terms of operating restrictions and data format when planning observations . 
 the impact of straylight and spectral leaks in contaminating the spectral images has been discussed , along with proposals of operational and analytical techniques that should mitigate their effects . when combined with the latest sensitivity estimates ( glasse et al . , 2014 , paper ix ) , we are confident that the miri mrs will meet all of its scientific objectives as part of the jwst observatory .

30,"linear wave functions in quantum chemistry are fundamentally limited by their inability to compactly express wave functions in strongly correlated regimes , a difficulty that arises directly from the factorial growth of hilbert space in the quantum many - body problem . in practice , therefore , the field of quantum chemistry has long pursued sophisticated nonlinear forms for its approximate wave function ansatzes . 
 @xcite a key challenge arises in this pursuit due to the difficulty of constructing an ansatz that is simultaneously size - consistent ( giving the same energy for independent systems when treated together or individually ) and variational ( giving an upper bound to the true energy ) while maintaining a cost that scales polynomially with system size . 
 recently , wave function stenciling , wich is a generalization of gutzwiller s approach @xcite in which a nonlinear correlation factor removes unsuitable terms from an overabundant fermionic expansion , has been shown to achieve these three properties , @xcite and so appears to be a promising paradigm for future ansatz design . 
 while the jastrow antisymmetric geminal power ( jagp ) in hilbert space is characteristic of this approach and has proven effective at capturing strong correlation during bond dissociations , @xcite it is much less effective for capturing the full range of dynamic correlation effects . 
 one way to understand this difficulty is to consider that its number - operator - based jastrow factor , which is central to its stenciling strategy , @xcite can also be written as a very limited coupled cluster doubles operator . 
 @xcite although sufficient for stenciling , this incomplete reproduction of the doubles operator only partially recovers dynamic correlation . in short , the hilbert space jastrow factor is effective at making large changes to the wave function through stenciling , but much less so at making the multitude of small changes demanded by dynamic correlation . 
 in contrast , more traditional jastrow factors in real space , @xcite especially when working in tandem with diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) , @xcite are renowned for their ability to capture dynamic correlation . 
 indeed , this pairing has been employed as a reliable substitute for the `` gold standard '' coupled cluster with singles , doubles , and perturbative - triples ( ccsd(t ) ) @xcite in cases where the latter s higher cost scaling makes it untenable . 
 @xcite    this dichotomy between jastrow factors strengths in real space and hilbert space raises the natural question : what is preventing the development of a jastrow factor that can deliver both the large changes required for stenciling and the small changes for dynamic correlation ? 
 further : can these obstacles be overcome in a way that maintains both low - order polynomial scaling as well as suitability for use as as a dmc guiding function in strongly correlated regimes , where the best current option is to rely on a factorial - cost determinantal expansion ? in this paper , we will present a real space formulation that answers these questions in the affirmative , explain why previous real space jastrows were not able to live up to this ideal , demonstrate that jastrow - based stenciling can be effective even when the stenciled wave function is a single slater determinant , and offer some thoughts on the requirements that should be satisfied in future by a general - purpose stenciling jastrow .    the essential challenge to performing stenciling in real space 
 is that any attempt to delete large portions of the wave function using a multiplicative jastrow factor will require its functional form to contain a high degree of curvature . 
 such curvature is necessary , as any smooth function that asymptotes to a constant value at infinite distance ( as a jastrow factor should ) and contains little curvature will be similar to a constant , and multiplication by this nearly - constant function will not produce large changes in the wave function .    unless the large curvature needed for stenciling can be hidden in some way , its tendency to raise the kinetic energy will lead the variational principle to eschew jastrow - based deletion of undesirable configurations , even in cases where the functional form could accommodate it . to address this challenge 
 , we present a new form of four - body jastrow factor that is better - suited to hiding its curvature in regions of low wave function value ( where it will not affect kinetic energy ) and to counting electrons within local regions of space ( the mechanism by which hilbert space jastrows achieve stenciling ) . 
 combined with traditional two - body jastrows , a slater determinant , and diffusion monte carlo , these real space number counting jastrow factors allow for an effective description of both static and dynamic correlation within a structure whose complexity is explicitly polynomial . 
 let us begin by reviewing hilbert space jastrow factors ( hsjfs ) , which may be written in terms of a matrix @xmath0 and the second quantized number operators @xmath1 within an orthonormal ( and typically local ) one particle basis , @xmath2 note that these can be thought of as four - body e - e - n - n jastrow factors , as the indices @xmath3 and @xmath4 run over orbitals that are localized at or near the nuclei while the results of operating with the number operators tell us about the positions of up to two different electrons . 
 as number operators are idempotent and overall constant factors irrelevant , @xmath0 can be chosen such that the hsjf contains any number of gaussian factors @xmath5 for use in wave function stenciling . 
 application of one of these factors to a fermionic wave function effectively reweights each configuration in that wave function s expansion within this particular orbital basis according to a gaussian distribution in the total occupancy of an orbital subset @xmath6 . 
 provided that the `` projection strength '' @xmath7 is sufficiently large , such a gaussian factor acts as a stencil , removing any configuration in which the set of orbitals @xmath6 contains an electron count differing from @xmath8 . 
 given two or more molecular fragments , this effect can be used to eliminate any configurations in which a fragment possesses an unphysical charge ( an `` ionic configuration '' ) , which turns out to be sufficient for restoring size consistency to a geminal power @xcite . crucially , this factor does nothing to components of the wave function which do not deviate from the prescribed pattern of subsystem electron counts , thus preventing the hsjf from raising the kinetic energy of configurations that survive the stencil . 
 unfortunately , a direct translation of the hsjf into real space is problematic for qmc methods due to the nonlocal nature of a number operator s real space form , @xmath9 efficient stochastic interrogations of a wave function in real space hinge on the ability to evaluate local wave function values @xmath10 , which is complicated by the number operators nonlocality . 
 instead , we will seek a local function @xmath11 , associated with a region @xmath6 , enclosed within a jastrow factor of similar gaussian form @xmath12 that permits efficient local evaluation and , thanks to the sum over all the electron positions @xmath13 , maintains the bosonic symmetry required by the jastrow factor to keep the overall wave function correctly antisymmetric .    in order to mimic the effects of a hsjf 
 , we therefore desire that each real space gaussian component approximate the effects of its hilbert space counterpart as closely as possible at any sampled position of the electrons ; thus we want @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fermionic wave function that is to undergo stenciling . 
 when basis orbitals in @xmath6 are spatially separated from others in the system  an ideal that is often approached in the localized physics of strong correlation  it is sufficient to choose @xmath11 as a step function : @xmath16 in which @xmath17 is a region exclusively supporting the orbitals in @xmath6 . to preserve smooth wave function derivatives and 
 allow for a gradual approach to step like behavior in cases where orbital subsets are partially overlapping in space , we relax the step discontinuity at the boundaries of @xmath17 by employing an analytical approximation to the heaviside function ( see section [ sec::ncjf_form ] ) . 
 so long as the smoothed form of q rapidly approaches 0 as one moves away from the boundary of @xmath17 , the jastrow factor of eq . 
 ( [ eqn : gauss_with_c ] ) retains the ability to precisely control the electron count on a subsystem that is spatially well - separated from other subsystems , as there is in this case ample room in between for the 1-to-0 switch to occur . 
 thus , as with a hsjf , the real space form presented here can fully eliminate ionic terms between well - separated subsystems , allowing it to restore exact size consistency to geminal powers and to aid in the repair of restricted slater determinants . 
 the key question now becomes whether we can construct functional forms for @xmath11 that permit useful demarcations of spatial regions while also ensuring that the curvature they introduce can be hidden in regions where its contribution to the kinetic energy , through the term @xmath18 is mitigated by small local wave function amplitudes @xmath19 . 
 this is of course trivial when demarcating a region around a well - separated fragment , but becomes less so during dissociation events , where partial stenciling becomes beneficial long before the well - separated limit is reached .      before detailing our proposed form for a stenciling - friendly 4-body jastrow factor , it is instructive to consider why existing 4-body forms are ill - suited for this task . 
 begin by considering a previously used form @xcite for 4-body jastrows that closely mirrors that of a hsjf : @xmath20 by diagonalizing @xmath0 , choosing @xmath21 appropriately , and ignoring changes to wave function normalization , one may convert this jastrow into a product of gaussians , @xmath22 in which @xmath23 is the unitary matrix that diagonalizes @xmath0 . 
 written this way , we may immediately identify the linear combination @xmath24 as one possible form for the counting function @xmath11 discussed in the previous section . 
 we may evaluate the suitability of 4-body jastrows of the type given in eq . 
 ( [ eqn:4body_form ] ) for use in hsjf - style stenciling by asking how easily these linear combinations can approximate a step function over a given region , and how much control they have over their curvature . by considering the task of controlling the electron count on a single atom 
 well - separated from the remainder of whatever system is being modeled , the above analysis makes plain that the two common forms for the basis functions @xmath25 , atom - centered gaussians @xcite and symmetric polynomials @xcite , are not effective for wave function stenciling in hilbert space . in the same way that one requires many fourier components to converge to a square wave , small gaussian expansions or low - order polynomial expansions are unable to faithfully approximate the switching behavior required for our jastrow basis functions . 
 indeed , gaussian functional forms contain significant curvature at and about the atom s center where the wave function is large in magnitude , and thus can not engage in the curvature hiding necessary to avoid a rise in kinetic energy when @xmath26 is large , i.e.  in the strong stenciling regime . 
 although it is true that in the infinite basis set limit , a complete set of functions ( such as the gaussian spherical harmonics ) can represent any smooth function , they will converge to the nearly steplike behavior required by @xmath11 only very slowly and so will retain appreciable curvature near the center of the counting region unless the jastrow basis is made extremely large . 
 in practice , therefore , the functional forms within previously - studied 4-body jastrows were inappropriate for stenciling , and so , during optimization , the variational principle did not explore their ability to eliminate ionic terms , as doing so would have led to large , curvature - induced increases in the kinetic energy . ultimately , as can be seen in sorella s carbon dimer results @xcite , the price for using a jastrow basis that can not easily represent a step function is , in the context of the jagp , a size consistency error stemming from the inadequate suppression of ionic terms . 
 we investigate the efficacy of real space number - counting jastrow factors ( ncjfs ) that can be written in the same general structure as existing four - body jastrows , @xmath27 as discussed above , the key characteristic of ncjfs will lie in the choice of basis functions @xmath28 , for which we select a form that can , to a certain degree , act as local real space approximations to hilbert space number operators . in the limit of disjoint orbital subspaces , bosonic step functions in real space can exactly reproduce the effects of a sum of hilbert space number operators and can thus serve as a conceptual starting point for our basis functions . 
 although we will soften this step - function extreme by employing smooth functions , we will retain the spirit of spatially localized curvature so as to facilitate the curvature hiding that ncjfs require in order to effect strong stenciling without unphysically affecting the kinetic energy . 
 this goal in mind , we propose `` counting '' basis functions of the form @xmath29 where the fermi - dirac - like function @xmath30 plays the role of an analytic approximation to the heaviside step function . 
 the value of @xmath31 asymptotically switches from zero to one as its argument traverses the origin , with @xmath32 ( which is _ not _ related to physical temperature ) determining both the slope at the origin as well as the effective width of the switching region in which @xmath31 meaningfully differs from zero or one and displays non - negligible curvature . 
 the interior function @xmath33 is a scalar - valued function of a real - space coordinate whose nodal surface defines the boundary , or switching surface , of the region within which electrons are to be counted . the volume for which @xmath34 takes on positive values ( negative values ) is called the interior ( exterior ) of the counting region , since composition with the switching function @xmath31 ensures that @xmath35 asymptotically evaluates to one ( zero ) inside this region . 
 we will refer to counting functions by the geometry of their switching surface , and in the present study we investigate both planar @xmath36 and elliptical @xmath37 counting regions . 
 the nodal surface of @xmath38 is a plane centered at @xmath39 and normal to the unit vector @xmath40 , while the nodal surface of @xmath41 is an ellipsoid with center @xmath39 and axes defined by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath42 . together with @xmath31 , these counting regions provide us with a set of jastrow basis functions whose only curvature appears at the edges of their counting regions , making it more amenable to being hidden in regions of low wave function magnitude . 
 this positioning of curvature should be compared to the more traditional forms given in section [ sec::existing_jastrows ] , which display significant curvature at their centers . 
 in addition to this stenciling - friendly curvature , arithmetic operations between these counting basis functions correspond to set operations between their interior volumes , which gives their sums and products a somewhat intuitive meaning . 
 for example , consider the large-@xmath32 limit of these counting functions , @xmath43 in which these functions revert to actual step functions . 
 spatial regions complements now occur simply as @xmath44 while intersections @xmath45 and unions @xmath46 arise from products and sums of counting functions . in this way , the quadratic form in eq . 
 ( [ eqn : jcjf_4body_form ] ) offers the possibility for the full set of first - order topological operations to arise naturally during the variational minimization of a ncjf , raising interesting questions as to whether adjacent regions will merge or produce cutouts from one another in pursuit of optimal stencils . 
 we have prepared a pilot implementation supporting planar and elliptical ncjfs within a development version of qmcpack .

 , we will distinguish wave functions based on the types of jastrow factors employed , whether or not the molecular orbitals were re - optimized in the presence of the jastrow , and , where applicable , whether the molecular orbitals are symmetric ( sa ) or have broken symmetry ( sb ) . 
 the presence of counting jastrows will be denoted by c , traditional spline - based @xmath47-@xmath47 and @xmath47-@xmath48 jastrows by t , and orbital re - optimization by the prefix `` oo- '' . in all cases 
 , js stands for jastrow - slater . 
 for example , a jastrow - slater wave function with both traditional and counting jastrows whose orbitals were re - optimized starting from a broken symmetry orbital guess would be denoted as oo - ctjs - sb . 
 finally , dmc results will be denoted by adding dmc to the name of the wave function that fixes the nodal surface .      as a minimally correlated wave function , 
 a single restricted slater determinant is insufficient to describe electron correlation at stretched molecular geometries , which can lead to large size - consistency errors during molecular fragmentation . to correct this 
 , we apply a simple ncjf with a basis consisting of two anti - aligned planar counting functions whose switching surfaces are set to bisect the h - h bond . the ncjf matrix parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 are initially set to zero ( so that the overall jastrow factor is initially unity ) , after which both the matrix parameters ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) and basis function parameters ( @xmath51 ) are optimized . 
 figures 1 and 2 show that ncjfs paired with either cusp - correcting jastrows ( ctjs ) , orbital optimization ( oo - cjs ) , or both ( oo - ctjs ) prove far more effective at recovering size - consistency than when only two - body jastrows ( tjs ) are used , even if assisted by orbital re - optimization ( oo - tjs ) . at a separation of 4  , for example 
 , we find that oo - ctjs is size - consistent to within 0.4 me@xmath52 , while the smallest size - consistency error achievable without ncjfs is over 14 me@xmath52 . 
 a variationally optimized slater - jastrow ansatz is often taken as a guiding function for diffusion monte carlo calculations , but the appearance of symmetry - broken minimum - energy solutions to the rhf equations at stretched geometries  which do not possess the correct nodal structure required by dmc  means that we can not naively take minimum - energy configurations without issue . 
 for instance , when stretching the c = c bond in ethene past 2.5  , an rhf solution with broken - symmetry orbitals sees its rhf energy drop below that of the symmetric - orbital solution . 
 however , the nodal surface of this broken - symmetry solution is incorrect , and so when used in dmc it gives an energy that is 40 me@xmath52 or more above that of a dmc based on the symmetric - orbital rhf solution ( see figure [ fig : figure3 ] ) . 
 in more complicated systems , such effects can be more pronounced , and it would be highly desirable to be able to predict beforehand which nodal surface is most appropriate . given a sufficiently flexible trial function to optimize , vmc can in principle produce the correct nodal surface by selecting the vmc wave function with the lowest energy .     using a cc - pvtz orbital basis . 
 the solid black line is twice the vmc energy of a single h atom in the same cc - pvtz basis . ]     using a cc - pvtz orbital basis , now focusing on stretched geometries . 
 the solid black line is twice the vmc energy of a single h atom in the same cc - pvtz basis . 
 ]    however , this approach will only be reliable if the trial function is flexible enough , and in the case of ethene , traditional jastrow - slater is not , even under orbital re - optimization , as can be seen in figure [ fig : figure4 ] . 
 although multiconfigurational expansions can be used in lieu of a single reference fermionic function in order to achieve the flexibility needed to describe the strong correlation responsible for flipping the energy ordering of these two states , the complexity and thus cost of such an expansion must grow exponentially with the number of correlated bonds . 
 the cost of a stenciling approach using ncjfs  assuming a constant number of counting basis functions per fragment  will by comparison scale only quadratically with fragment number , and so it would be quite useful if stenciling were able to capture a sufficient amount of strong correlation to produce the correct energy ordering of states at the vmc level .    using the same planar ncjfs as in the hydrogen case 
 ( except now the planes bisect the c = c bond ) , we apply ncjfs , orbital optimization , and traditional two - body jastrows to a single slater determinant that is either a symmetry - adapted ( sa ) or symmetry - broken ( sb ) rhf solution . 
 ( note that sa vs sb orbitals did not interconvert under orbital optimization and appear to represent two separate minima on the optimization surface . ) in the most flexible case , oo - ctjs , vmc is now correctly able to predict that the sa energy lies below that of the sb energy , a prediction that fails to materialize if the ncjf is omitted ( see figure [ fig : figure4 ] ) . upon using the oo - ctjs - sa and oo - ctjs - sb wave functions to fix the dmc nodal surface , we find that the lower - energy vmc state now corresponds to the lower energy dmc result , and that the lower energy dmc result is in close agreement with mrcisd+q ( see figure [ fig : figure5 ] ) . 
 thus , in the case of the ethene double bond dissociation at least , the ncjfs ability to suppress spurious ionic terms within a single slater determinant is sufficient to produce a qualitatively correct state ordering and nodal surface without resorting to multi - determinantal expansions . 
 fragment , with no jastrow factor ( rhf ) or with a cusp - correcting jastrow ( tjs ) , as indicated , and provide a reference for size - consistency . ]          using elliptical basis functions , we will demonstrate the size - consistency problem encountered with basis functions used previously in four - body jastrow factors . 
 as noted earlier , the main problem associated with taking atom - centered gaussian functions as the jastrow basis lies in their inability to effectively hide their curvature in regions where wave function values are small . 
 we reproduce this effect in ethene at a stretched geometry ( 4.5  ) by changing our jastrow basis from c = c bond - bisecting planes to a set of elliptical counting functions in which we scan over an axis scaling parameter @xmath53 while keeping one elliptical edge orthogonally bisecting the c = c bond axis . 
 ncjf parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath21 , @xmath32 ) are fixed at values optimal for planar counting functions , which allows us to reproduce the behavior of the planar basis as we increase the axis scale ( at large values of @xmath53 ) . 
 this gives us a suitable baseline to compare the elliptical and planar jastrow basis at different geometries , and , as we expect , vmc energies match reasonably well when each elliptical counting function encompasses an entire ch@xmath54 fragment . 
 however , as we shrink the elliptical switching surface to only partially encompass each fragment , figure [ fig : figure6 ] shows that the overall energy increases , which can be explained by the fact that the curvature at the edge of the elliptical counting region is now cutting through a region with appreciable wave function magnitude . 
 for jastrow basis functions like these too - small ellipses , the risk of such energetic penalties prevents the variational principle from allowing the elements of the jastrow matrix @xmath0 to become large in magnitude , thus precluding any stenciling - like effects . when instead the basis function allows for curvature hiding , as when the ellipse is large enough so that its edges are outside the boundaries of the ch@xmath54 fragment , the variational principle is free to restore size - consistency by using large - magnitude @xmath0 elements to delete spurious ionic terms . 
 while we have shown that the combination of suitably chosen jastrow basis functions with a general 4-body jastrow factor form can successfully introduce strong correlation effects through the stenciling of ionic terms , a generally applicable method requires some rule or prescription for how the jastrow counting functions are to be chosen for an arbitrary molecule . 
 let us discuss and discard two options based on the current planes and ellipses before motivating future work with some observations on the properties that a general ncjf basis should satisfy . 
 first , one might choose to place planar counting functions so as to bisect each bond in a molecule . 
 such an approach would prepare the ansatz for suppressing unwanted ionic terms in any given bond , but the infinite extent of the planes would clearly not in general satisfy the requirement that the counting function s curvature be hidden in regions of small wave function magnitude . 
 what if the plane from one bond intersects a far - away atom ?    . 
 as @xmath53 is increased , the ellipses grow in size until eventually encompassing an entire ch@xmath54 fragment , with vertical lines showing the values of @xmath53 at which the ellipses outer surfaces cut directly across an atomic nucleus . 
 the horizontal black line indicates the vmc energy of planar counting regions , which should serve as a lower bound for the energy in the @xmath55 limit . ] 
 second , one could consider using atom - centered ellipsoids for the counting regions , hoping to take advantage of set operations to generate unions of elliptical counting regions where necessary to encompass an overall fragment . while this scheme sounds more promising , 
 the data presented in figure [ fig : figure7 ] show that in practice , such set operations do not work out cleanly . 
 the trouble in this case is due to the fact that the optimal switching functions are much smoother than sharp step functions ( which would have dire kinetic energy consequences ) , and so clean set operations to create a union of neighboring counting regions are not achievable within the chosen 4-body form of the overall ncjf . while the symmetry of ethene still allows for the eliminate ionic terms via an @xmath0 that suppresses terms in which the left - hand and right - hand fragments not - quite - correctly - unioned counting regions give differing electron counts , the imperfections in the union create residual jastrow curvature in between the c and h atoms where the wave function magnitude is not small . 
 this residual curvature increases the kinetic energy of the neutral terms that survive the stenciling process , and it appears from the results in figure [ fig : figure7 ] that this effect is large enough that the variational principle instead chooses to eschew strong suppression of ionic terms . 
 the difficulties in the above two schemes highlight the properties that should be sought in future for general - purpose ncjf basis functions . 
 first , the function should be finite in spatial extent , so that when used for stenciling in one region they do not unduly affect the kinetic energy in distant parts of the molecule . 
 second , the functions must be capable of clean set operations so that they can combine when necessary to form a counting region around a group of atoms . 
 finally , they must remain efficiently evaluable for a randomly chosen configuration of the electrons so as not to disrupt the algorithmic requirements of vmc . 
 although the presently tested planes and ellipsoids do not meet all of these requirements , the success of fragment - encompassing counting regions in the challenging dissociation of ethene provides strong motivation to search for a formulation that does . 
 we have demonstrated that 4-body real space jastrow factors are , with a suitable choice of jastrow basis functions , capable of performing strong wave function stenciling , in which a multiplicative jastrow factor makes a large change to the wave function by deleting unphysical configurations from a simple but overabundant fermionic reference . in particular , these jastrow factors are capable of eliminating ionic terms between well - separated molecular fragments , which restores exact size consistency to the geminal power and greatly improves the situation for restricted slater determinants , bringing real space jastrows in line with the size - consistency - restoring properties already enjoyed by hilbert space jastrows . unlike their hilbert space brethren , the real space jastrows presented here are compatible with diffusion monte carlo , which creates exciting possibilities for generating qualitatively correct nodal surfaces in strongly correlated regimes with a variational monte carlo approach that is both polynomial cost and size consistent . indeed , 
 our preliminary results show that , when equipped with these stenciling - capable jastrow factors , the variational minimization of a single reference jastrow - slater trial function produces a qualitatively correct nodal surface during the double bond dissociation of ethene , which in turn leads diffusion monte carlo to produce an accurate potential energy curve . as every step in this process has a polynomially scaling cost , it will be very exciting in future to test the efficacy of this combination in larger and more strongly correlated settings . 
 the key development allowing for effective stenciling was the introduction of a new form of 4-body jastrow basis function , in which a smoothed indicator function is used to check whether or not each electron is within a given region of space . 
 these basis functions thereby allow the overall jastrow factor to count and control how many electrons are in a given region , which in turn allows for the suppression of unwanted ionic configurations . 
 unlike previously explored basis function forms , these counting functions have no curvature except at the boundary of their spatial region , allowing them to participate in strong stenciling so long as the boundaries are arranged so as to hide their curvature in regions of small wave function magnitude . 
 in contrast , gaussian - type basis functions have significant curvature at their centers , leading to kinetic energy changes that prevent effective stenciling . 
 the most pressing priority in the future development of these number counting jastrow factors is to formulate them in a way that permits for black - box treatments of arbitrary molecules in which the variational principle can decide automatically how to demarcate important regions in which to count and control electron number . 
 although the planar and elliptical forms used in this study do not appear to support this black - box ideal , research into promising alternatives is underway .

31,"the direct and precise measurement of the self - coupling between the electroweak gauge bosons in @xmath2-pair production will be a crucial step in testing the standard model of electroweak interactions and searching for physics beyond it . 
 it will form an important part of the physics programme at lep2 and at a planned linear @xmath3-collider ( lc ) . 
 as is well known there are three diagrams at tree level that contribute to the amplitude of @xmath4 in the standard model , one with @xmath5-channel neutrino exchange and the other two with a @xmath6 or @xmath7 in the @xmath8-channel , involving the vertices @xmath1 and @xmath0 . 
 one can parametrise the corresponding vertex functions in order to quantify the couplings and to compare them with their form in the standard model . in the most general form respecting lorentz covariance 
 each vertex involves seven complex form factors @xcite , three of which give couplings that violate @xmath9 symmetry .    without further physical assumptions one 
 is thus left with 28 real parameters whose simultaneous extraction in one experiment looks quite hopeless . given the limited event statistics expected at both lep2 and the lc one will only obtain meaningful errors on a reduced number of coupling parameters at one time . 
 this may be achieved by imposing certain constraints on the full set of coupling constants ; various suggestions for such constraints based on symmetry considerations have been made in the literature @xcite . 
 one must however keep in mind that experimental values or bounds on couplings that have been obtained with particular constraints can not be converted into results without constraints or with different ones ; the information lost by assuming relations between couplings can not be retrieved . 
 although imposing such constraints is certainly legitimate and can be useful we stress that a data analysis with independent couplings will be valuable , both from the point of view of model independence and the capability to compare results of different experiments . 
 we remark that of course one can also give ( reasonably small ) errors on _ single or few _ couplings in a multi - parameter analysis . in this paper 
 we propose a parametrisation of the couplings which is well adapted to this end , the statistical errors on the different measured parameters being approximately uncorrelated . 
 we will work in the framework of optimal observables , a way to extract unknown coupling parameters introduced for the case of one parameter in @xcite that has since been used for various reactions @xcite . 
 general aspects of this method , in particular its extension to an arbitrary number of parameters , as well as its application to @xmath10 production were discussed in @xcite . in this paper 
 we investigate again the reaction @xmath11 . 
 we concentrate here on the decay channels , where one @xmath2 decays hadronically and the other into an electron or muon and its neutrino . calculated with the born level cross section of the standard model the statistics of these channels 
 is about 3000 events for a collision energy of @xmath12 and @xmath13 integrated luminosity , which are typical planned lep2 parameters , and about 22000 events with @xmath14 at @xmath15 , which might be achieved at the lc . 
 a complementary source of information is the integrated cross section , which is a quadratic function of the triple gauge couplings . 
 the combination of information from the total event rate and from observables that make use of the detailed distribution in the final state has for example been used in @xcite , where @xmath9 violation in the decay @xmath16 was investigated .    in sec . 
 [ sec : method ] of this paper we will further develop some aspects of the method of optimal observables , in particular we will show how to apply it without the linear approximation in the coupling parameters that was used in @xcite . in sec .  [ sec : diagon ] we then propose a parametrisation of the couplings that simultaneously diagonalises certain matrices connected with our observables and with the integrated cross section . 
 these parameters achieve two goals : their quadratic contribution to the total cross section is a simple sum of squares and the covariance matrix of the corresponding optimal observables is diagonal . the methods which we use for this purpose 
 are borrowed from the theory of small oscillations of a system with @xmath17 degrees of freedom ( cf . 
 e.g.  @xcite ) . 
 our parameters correspond to `` normal coordinates '' and their use in an experimental analysis should in our view present several advantages . 
 we give some numerical examples for @xmath2-pair production at lep2 and the lc in sec . 
 [ sec : numeric ] and make some further remarks on how our proposal might be implemented in practice in sec . 
 [ sec : practice ] . 
 the last section of this paper gives a summary of our main points . 
 the method of optimal observables has previously been presented in the approximation that the couplings to be extracted are sufficiently small to allow for a leading order taylor expansion of various expressions . here 
 we show how to use it beyond this approximation . 
 let us denote by @xmath18 the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 form factors minus their values in the standard model at tree level . 
 as the amplitude of our process is linear in these couplings we can write the differential cross section as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a positive semidefinite symmetric matrix . 
 @xmath21 collectively denotes the set of measured phase space variables . 
 the integrated cross section is @xmath22 with the standard model cross section @xmath23 and coefficients @xmath24 the idea of using integrated observables is to define suitable functions @xmath25 of the phase space variables and to extract the unknown couplings from their measured mean values @xmath26 . 
 let us give the details . from ( [ diffxsection ] ) and ( [ intxsection ] ) we obtain the expectation value @xmath27 $ ] of @xmath28 as @xmath29 - e_0[{{\cal o}}_i ] = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{j } c_{ij } \ , g_j      + \sum_{jk } q_{ijk } \ , g_j g_k}{\displaystyle 1 + \sum_{j }      { \hat{\sigma}_{1,j } } \ , g_j + \sum_{jk } { \hat{\sigma}_{2,jk } } \ , g_j g_k}\ ] ] with the standard model expectation value @xmath30 = ( \int d\phi \ , { { \cal o}}_i 
 s_0 ) / \sigma_0 $ ] and coefficients @xmath31 \ , { \hat{\sigma}_{1,j } }   { \hspace{6pt},}\nonumber \\    q_{ijk } & = & \frac{1}{\sigma_0 } \int d\phi \ , { { \cal o}}_i s_{2,jk } -    e_0[{{\cal o}}_i ] \ , { \hat{\sigma}_{2,jk } } { \hspace{6pt}.}\end{aligned}\ ] ] we remark in passing that the coefficients in ( [ expect ] ) can be written in a compact form as @xmath32 { \hspace{6pt},}\hspace{3em }    q_{ijk } { \hspace{0.4em } = \hspace{0.4em}}v_0[{{\cal o}}_i \ , , \ ; s_{2,jk } /s_0 ] { \hspace{6pt},}\nonumber \\    { \hat{\sigma}_{1,j } } & = & e_0[s_{1,j } /s_0 ] { \hspace{6pt},}\hspace{4.4em }    { \hat{\sigma}_{2,jk } } { \hspace{0.4em } = \hspace{0.4em}}e_0[s_{2,jk } /s_0 ] { \hspace{6pt},}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath33 = e_0[f g ] - e_0[f ] \ , e_0[g]$ ] is the covariance of @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the standard model . 
 note that @xmath36 is symmetric and positive definite , whereas @xmath37 as a matrix in @xmath38 and @xmath39 is symmetric but in general indefinite . 
 an estimation of the couplings can now be obtained by solving the system ( [ expect ] ) with @xmath27 $ ] replaced by the mean values @xmath26 , @xmath40 = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{j } c_{ij } \ 
 , g_j      + \sum_{jk } q_{ijk } \ , g_j g_k}{\displaystyle 1 + \sum_{j }      { \hat{\sigma}_{1,j } } \ , g_j + \sum_{jk } { \hat{\sigma}_{2,jk } } \ , g_j g_k }   { \hspace{6pt},}\ ] ] provided of course one has @xmath41 observables for @xmath41 unknown couplings . 
 when the system ( [ mean ] ) is linearised in the @xmath18 it is easily solved by inversion of the matrix @xmath42 . 
 one is however not constrained to do so and can instead solve the exact set of equations ( [ mean ] ) . by multiplication with the denominator 
 it can be rearranged to a coupled set of quadratic equations in the @xmath18 and will in general have several solutions . 
 some of these may be complex and thus ruled out , but from the information of the @xmath43 alone one can not tell which of the remaining real ones is the physical solution . 
 we will come back to this point . 
 the measured mean values @xmath43 are of course only equal to the @xmath27 $ ] up to systematic and statistical errors . 
 we only consider the latter here , which are given by the covariance matrix @xmath44 of the observables @xmath28 divided by the number @xmath45 of events in the analysis . 
 to convert the errors on the observables into errors on the extracted couplings we use the quantity @xmath46 \right ) n    v({{\cal o}})^{-1 } { } _ { ij } \left ( { \bar{{{\cal o}}}}_j - e[{{\cal o}}_j ] \right ) { \hspace{6pt},}\ ] ] which depends on the @xmath18 through the @xmath27 $ ] given in ( [ expect ] ) . 
 solving ( [ mean ] ) is tantamount to minimising @xmath47 with @xmath48 , and a confidence region on the couplings is as usual given by @xmath49 with the constant determined by the desired confidence level . 
 there are several possible choices for the covariance matrix @xmath50 in ( [ chi ] ) 
 . it can be    1 . 
 determined from the measured distribution of the observables @xmath28 , 2 . 
 calculated from the differential cross section ( [ diffxsection ] ) , taking for the @xmath18 the values extracted in the measurement , 3 . 
 calculated for vanishing couplings @xmath18 , 4 . 
 calculated as a function of the couplings . 
 choices 1 .  and 2 . 
 should lead to the same results in the limit of large @xmath45 where the statistical errors on the measured @xmath44 and @xmath18 become small . 
 comparison of the covariance matrices obtained by these two methods might indeed be helpful to rule out unphysical solutions of ( [ mean ] ) . 
 .  in turn will be a good approximation of 2 . 
 if the couplings are small enough . we consider possibility 4 .  as the least practical one , except maybe for the case of one coupling . for several couplings 
 the expression of @xmath44 as a function of the @xmath18 involves tensors of rank up to four and is even more complicated than the one for the expectation values ( [ expect ] ) , and the inverse matrix is yet more clumsy . for this reason we will discard choice 4 .  in the following .    in @xcite 
 we considered an analysis at leading order in the @xmath18 , where one uses the linearised form of ( [ mean ] ) to estimate the couplings : @xmath51 \right )   { \hspace{6pt}.}\ ] ] correspondingly the linear approximation of ( [ expect ] ) is used in the expression ( [ chi ] ) of @xmath47 which then reads @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the inverse covariance matrix of the estimated couplings @xcite . as one works to leading order in the @xmath18 
 one can approximate @xmath50 by its value for zero couplings , i.e.  choose possibility 3 .  above . 
 the confidence regions @xmath54 for the measured couplings are then ellipsoids in the space of the @xmath18 with centre at @xmath55 . 
 the optimal observables @xmath56 discussed in @xcite have the property that to leading order the statistical errors on the estimated couplings are the smallest possible ones that can be obtained with _ any _ method , including e.g.  a maximum likelihood fit to the full distribution of @xmath21 given by the differential cross section ( [ diffxsection ] ) . 
 note that one can still use the linearised expressions ( [ linearestim ] ) and ( [ linearchi ] ) in an analysis beyond leading order . 
 the error @xmath57 on the couplings will be given by an ellipsoid with defining matrix ( [ couplingscov ] ) , where @xmath50 is the covariance matrix at the actual values of the couplings . 
 these errors will in general no longer be optimal , so that when the leading order approximation is not good one might obtain better errors with a different choice of observables . 
 more importantly , however , the extracted values of the couplings are biased : averaged over a large number of experiments the measured couplings differ from the actual ones by terms quadratic in the @xmath18 . 
 if instead one uses the full expressions ( [ expect ] ) , ( [ mean ] ) and ( [ chi ] ) one has no bias on the extracted coupling parameters , provided the number @xmath45 of events in the analysis is large enough . let us see if we can find optimal observables for this case . to this end 
 we expand the differential cross section around some values @xmath58 of the couplings : @xmath59 the corresponding zeroth order cross sections and mean values are @xmath60 and @xmath61 = ( \int d\phi \ , { { \cal o}}_i \widetilde{s}_0 ) / \widetilde{\sigma}_0 $ ] , respectively 
 . we then can re - express @xmath27 $ ] in ( [ expect ] ) , replacing @xmath18 with @xmath62 , @xmath63 with @xmath64 , and using new coefficients @xmath65 etc . 
 constructed as in ( [ xsectioncoeffs ] ) , ( [ obscoeffs ] ) . making the same replacements in ( [ mean ] ) we have an alternative set of equations to extract the coupling parameters . 
 it can be shown that for sufficiently large @xmath45 the confidence regions obtained from ( [ chi ] ) , ( [ confidence ] ) in a nonlinear analysis are again ellipsoids given by @xmath66 one can then write @xmath67 as in ( [ linearchi ] ) , but with @xmath68 of ( [ couplingscov ] ) replaced by @xmath69 where @xmath70 corresponds to an expansion ( [ newdiffxsection ] ) of @xmath71 about the _ actual _ values of the couplings . 
 the main point of the argument is that for large @xmath45 the statistical errors on the @xmath26 become small , so that the extracted couplings will be sufficiently close to the actual ones to allow for a linearisation of ( [ expect ] ) and ( [ mean ] ) , cf . 
 @xcite , p.695 , and @xcite . 
 finally one can construct new observables @xmath72 from ( [ newdiffxsection ] ) . 
 they will be optimal , i.e.  have minimum statistical error if the @xmath58 are equal to the actual values of the @xmath18 . in the appendix 
 we show that , up to linear reparametrisations given in ( [ reparam ] ) , this is the only set of @xmath41 integrated observables that measures the @xmath41 couplings with minimum error . 
 there is hence no choice of observables that would be optimal for _ all _ values of the actual coupling parameters . as these 
 are unknown one can in practice not write down the truly `` optimal '' observables , but our argument tells us how one can improve on the choice in ( [ optimal ] ) if one has some previous estimates @xmath58 of the couplings ( cf . 
 also @xcite ) . 
 one may then choose to perform a leading order analysis as described above , linearising about @xmath73 instead of @xmath74 . 
 a practical way to proceed could be to estimate the parameters @xmath18 at first using the linearised method around @xmath75 . 
 suppose this gives as best estimate some values @xmath76 . 
 then in a second step one could set @xmath77 and use the linearised method around @xmath78 to improve the estimate etc .    at this point 
 we wish to comment on the `` optimal technique '' for determining unknown parameters in the differential cross section that has been proposed in @xcite . 
 the `` weighting functions '' @xmath79 there depend on the actual values of the parameters one wants to extract and are thus not `` observables '' . only if one sets the unknown parameters in the @xmath79 equal to some previous estimates of them can one use these functions to weight individual events ; the better these estimates are the more sensitive the functions will be . if one does this then the set @xmath79 is equivalent to our observables ( [ newoptimal ] ) defined for some estimates @xmath58 of the coupling parameters . 
 we finally remark that if @xmath45 is not large enough the statistical errors on the mean values @xmath26 and thus on the measured couplings might be so large that they lead into a region where a linearisation of ( [ expect ] ) is not a good approximation . 
 the covariance matrix @xmath80 is then no longer given by ( [ newcouplingscov ] ) . 
 moreover the errors on the couplings might be asymmetric and the shape of the confidence region defined by ( [ chi ] ) , ( [ confidence ] ) very different from an ellipsoid , so that knowledge of @xmath80 is not sufficient to estimate the errors on the @xmath18 . in such a case 
 we can not say on general grounds how sensitive our observables are . 
 incidentally this also holds for other extraction methods such as maximum likelihood fits , whose optimal properties are realised in the limit @xmath81 . 
 if one is rather far from this limit the sensitivity of a method will have to be determined by other means , e.g.  by detailed monte carlo simulations . 
 the method we have outlined can of course also be applied if one chooses to reduce the number of unknown parameters by imposing certain linear constraints on the couplings . 
 one may still use the observables ( [ optimal ] ) corresponding to the _ full _ set of couplings but minimise @xmath47 in ( [ chi ] ) for the _ reduced _ set ; in this case one can of course not take choice 2.for @xmath50 . in general @xmath82 is then different from zero and its value indicates to which extent the particular constraints on the couplings are compatible with the data . 
 if @xmath45 is large enough @xmath82 follows in fact a @xmath47-distribution with @xmath83 degrees of freedom for @xmath41 observables and @xmath84 independent couplings so that its value can be converted into a confidence level @xcite . 
 we conclude with a remark on the use of optimal observables in practice 
 . a realistic data analysis will not be good enough if the born approximation of the differential cross section ( [ diffxsection ] ) is used . 
 both higher - order theoretical corrections , such as initial state radiation and the finite @xmath2 width , and experimental effects like detection efficiency and resolution will modify the observed distribution of the phase space parameters @xmath21 . 
 if they are taken into account in the determination of the coefficients in ( [ expect ] ) , ( [ mean ] ) and of the covariance matrix @xmath50 they will _ not _ lead to any bias in the extraction of the couplings and their errors . while this will presumably be done with sets of generated events and 
 might be computationally intensive one still has to determine only a rather limited number of `` sensitivity '' constants . on the other hand one needs to know the observables @xmath25 of ( [ optimal ] ) as functions over the entire experimental phase space , 
 so that the expressions of @xmath85 and @xmath86 used to construct them will in practice be taken from a less sophisticated approximation to the actual distribution of @xmath21 in order to keep them manageable . 
 the observables are then no longer optimal , and it will depend on the individual case which approximations of @xmath85 , @xmath86 are good enough to obtain observables with a sensitivity close to the optimal one .      in @xcite it was shown how with a suitable combination of all semileptonic @xmath87 decay channels one can define observables that are either even or odd under the discrete transformations @xmath9 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 denotes charge conjugation , @xmath90 the parity transformation , and @xmath91 the `` naive '' time reversal operation which flips particle momenta and spins but does not interchange initial and final state . under the conditions on the experimental setup and event selection spelt out in @xcite we have two important symmetry properties :    1 . 
 a @xmath9 odd observable can only have a nonzero expectation value if @xmath9 symmetry is violated in the reaction . 
 2 .   if the expectation value of a @xmath88 odd observable is nonzero the transition amplitude must have an absorptive part whose phase must satisfy certain requirements in order to give an interference with the nonabsorptive part of the amplitude . 
 we assume in this analysis that any nonstandard physics in the reaction is due to the triple gauge vertices . in the standard model one needs at least two loops to violate @xmath9 ; to a good accuracy the triple gauge couplings are therefore the only possible source of @xmath9 violation . for our process , 
 i.e.  @xmath3 annihilation into four fermions , an absorptive part that satisfies the requirements mentioned in point 2 .  will appear in the standard model already at next - to - leading order in the electroweak fine structure constant , either through nonresonant diagrams or through loop corrections . to leading order , however , they are only due to the imaginary parts of triple gauge couplings .    in this approximation the optimal observables ( [ optimal ] ) are @xmath9 even ( odd ) if they correspond to @xmath9 conserving ( violating ) couplings , and @xmath88 even ( odd ) if they correspond to the real ( imaginary ) parts of form factors . 
 the coefficient matrix @xmath92 is then block diagonal in four symmetry classes of observables and three - boson - couplings :    1 . 
 @xmath9 and @xmath88 even 2 . 
 @xmath9 even and @xmath88 odd 3 . 
 @xmath9 odd and @xmath88 even 4 . 
 @xmath9 and @xmath88 odd .    in the leading order analysis one 
 thus can treat these four classes of couplings separately and benefit from a great reduction of unknown parameters . beyond leading order , however , form factors of any symmetry can contribute to @xmath27 $ ] :    * in the integrated cross section and thus in the denominator of @xmath27 - e_0[{{\cal o}}_i]$ ] in ( [ expect ] ) couplings of all four classes enter quadratically , couplings of class @xmath93 also appear linearly ; * if @xmath28 belongs to class @xmath93 the numerator of @xmath27 -    e_0[{{\cal o}}_i]$ ] has terms linear in the couplings of this class but couplings of all four classes enter quadratically through @xmath94 ; * if @xmath28 belongs to a @xmath9 ( @xmath88 ) odd coupling then the numerator in ( [ expect ] ) is only linear in @xmath9 ( @xmath88 ) odd couplings , but it contains also quadratic terms where a @xmath9 ( @xmath88 ) odd coupling is multiplied with a @xmath9 ( @xmath88 ) even one . 
 we remark that this leads to different behaviours of @xmath27 $ ] as one or more couplings @xmath18 become large : whereas for observables in classes @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 the expectation value goes to zero when a coupling of the same class goes to plus or minus infinity the corresponding limit of an observable in class @xmath93 can be a positive or negative constant or zero .    in a nonlinear analysis one 
 will therefore in principle have to consider couplings with all symmetries at the same time . in practice one might choose simpler procedures if the linear approximation is expected to be not too bad and if one wants to calculate corrections to it . 
 one might for instance first analyse the four symmetry classes separately , neglecting in each case the contributions of the three other classes at the r.h.s . 
 of ( [ mean ] ) and then refine the analysis of a class by taking the values obtained in the first step for the couplings in the other classes as fixed in ( [ mean ] ) .    we emphasise that even beyond the leading order approximation it is still true that a nonzero mean value of a @xmath9 or a @xmath88 odd observable is an unambiguous sign of @xmath9 violation or the presence of absorptive parts in the process , respectively . the extraction of the values of the couplings , however , becomes more involved than in leading order . 
 we shall now propose a method to analyse the data which presents several advantages in view of the basic problem posed by the large number of unknown three - boson couplings : with limited event statistics significant error bounds can only be obtained for subsets of the coupling parameters , but imposing constraints on the couplings to reduce their number entails a loss of information that can not be retrieved . in view of this 
 it should be advantageous to use a parametrisation of the couplings which in a given process and at a given c.m . 
 energy has the following properties :    1 . 
 it allows to find observables which are only sensitive to one particular coupling parameter . 
 2 .   the induced errors on the couplings determined from these observables are statistically independent . 
 with this we can on the one hand give single errors for each parameter , on the other hand we can recover from the single errors the multidimensional error of the full set of couplings , having avoided the loss of information incurred by imposing constraints . from the single errors we can also directly see which combinations of couplings in more conventional parametrisations can be measured with good accuracy and to which one is rather insensitive . 
 let us remark that in the leading order analysis there is a set of observables satisfying point 1 .  in _ any _ parametrisation of the couplings . 
 the linear combinations @xmath98 of our optimal observables ( [ optimal ] ) are only sensitive to @xmath18 for each @xmath99 ( cf .  also @xcite ) . 
 the errors on the couplings determined from these observables are , however , in general not uncorrelated ; in fact their correlations are the same as those obtained with the original set @xmath28 . 
 this can be seen as follows : going from the @xmath28 to the @xmath100 we must replace @xmath101 so that we have from ( [ couplingscov ] ) @xmath102 in such a case the single errors give an incomplete picture of the situation if correlations are large . 
 this is illustrated in fig . 
 [ fig : correlations ] @xmath93 , where the 1@xmath103 ellipsis for two parameters is shown . 
 their single errors are given by its projection on the coordinate axes and in our example are both rather large . 
 some linear combinations of them are however measurable with much better precision , which one can only recognise if both errors and their correlations are given . in fig . 
 [ fig : correlations ] @xmath95 where a set of couplings leading to uncorrelated errors is used the situation is much simpler . 
 note also that the number of correlations , i.e.  off - diagonals in @xmath80 , is yet modest for two couplings but increases rapidly with their number . 
 ( 0,0 )    ( 5502,3031)(889,-4805 ) ( 1981,-2401)(0,0)[lb ] ( 5131,-2401)(0,0)[lb ] ( 6391,-3706)(0,0)[lb ] ( 3241,-3706)(0,0)[lb ] ( 1116,-2006)(0,0)[lb ] ( 4176,-2006)(0,0)[lb ]    we will now first see that a parametrisation of the couplings satisfying both points 1 .  and 2 . 
 above can be found in idealised circumstances , and then mention the restrictions one will encounter under more realistic assumptions . 
 if the leading order analysis is a sufficiently good approximation the solution to our problem is easily found . 
 starting from a set of couplings @xmath18 and the corresponding optimal observables @xmath28 in ( [ optimal ] ) we can go to another set @xmath104 by @xmath105 where we use vector and matrix notation . 
 the coefficients in the expansion of the differential cross section and the optimal observables transform as follows : @xmath106 let now @xmath28 be an arbitrary set of observables related to @xmath18 and define the corresponding @xmath107 related to @xmath104 as in ( [ obstransf ] ) . 
 then we have for the matrices relevant for our analysis the following transformation properties : @xmath108 as shown in @xcite our optimal observables satisfy @xmath109 and @xmath110 so that for them one can choose a transformation @xmath111 which diagonalises all three matrices . 
 this new set @xmath112 of parameters obviously has the properties 1 .  and 2 . 
 we were looking for .    beyond the linear approximation of ( [ expect ] ) the expectation value of @xmath107 
 will still receive contributions from several couplings . 
 in fact there is no set of observables for which the full nonlinear expression in ( [ expect ] ) satisfies point 1 . 
 exactly , because the denominator involves quadratic terms in _ all _ couplings , and this can not be changed by any linear transformation of the couplings . 
 if on the other hand the statistical errors are too large the covariance matrix @xmath80 will not give a good picture of the errors as we discussed in sec . 
 [ sec : method ] , and its diagonalisation will not ensure point 2 . in the case 
 however where nonlinear effects in the determination of the couplings and their errors are not too large , i.e.  where the leading order expressions are a good first approximation both points 1 .  and 2 . 
 above will still be _ approximately _ satisfied in a full nonlinear analysis . 
 we remark that if one has some previous estimates @xmath58 of the couplings that considerably deviate from zero one may reduce nonlinear effects in the determination of the @xmath18 by working with an expansion of @xmath113 around the @xmath58 as shown in sec . 
 [ sec : method ] ; in our diagonalisation programme one will then use couplings @xmath114 instead of @xmath18 , the matrix @xmath70 instead of @xmath115 etc .    to the extent that the observables ( [ optimal ] ) are constructed from expressions of @xmath85 and @xmath116 which are only approximations of those that determine the experimentally observed kinematical distribution 
 the matrices @xmath115 , @xmath50 and @xmath117 will not quite be the same and can not be diagonalised at the same time . 
 one can then diagonalise either @xmath50 or @xmath68 because they are by definition symmetric and positive definite , whereas @xmath115 is not necessarily so . again , unless such effects are large one will end up with a matrix @xmath118 that is not diagonal but has relatively small off - diagonals .    it should also be borne in mind that the covariance matrix @xmath80 only gives the statistical errors on the couplings , so that even if it is exactly diagonal the final errors may be correlated due to systematics .      the choice of transformation in ( [ couplingstransf ] ) to ( [ matrixtransf ] ) is not unique if one does not require @xmath111 to be orthogonal . 
 we see in fact no strong argument in favour of an orthogonal transformation and remark that the various parametrisations of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 couplings in the literature are related by non - orthogonal linear transformations . 
 the freedom to choose @xmath111 can be used to impose additional conditions on the transformation , and the one we propose here is that the transformed quadratic coefficient @xmath119 in the integrated cross section be the unit matrix . in terms of the new couplings one then has @xmath120 where we choose the numbering such that @xmath121 to @xmath122 belong to symmetry class @xmath93 introduced in sec . 
 [ sec : symmetries ] , i.e.   they are the @xmath9 and @xmath88 even couplings . 
 only these appear linearly in the cross section , whereas all couplings give a quadratic contribution with coefficient one . 
 having @xmath123 leads to a convenient simplification of ( [ expect ] ) , ( [ mean ] ) . 
 moreover , the measurement of the total cross section gives complementary information on the unknown couplings . rewriting ( [ xsectransf ] ) as @xmath124 we see that measuring a cross section @xmath125 within an error @xmath126 constrains the couplings to be in a shell between two hyperspheres with centre at @xmath127 in the space of all couplings as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : shell ] . 
 their radii are given by @xmath128 here @xmath129\ ] ] is the smallest value the cross section can attain ; that such a minimum exists has been pointed out in @xcite . 
 if in ( [ radii ] ) @xmath130 is positive but @xmath131 negative the couplings are inside the hypersphere with radius @xmath132 , and if both @xmath130 and @xmath131 are negative the ansatz ( [ diffxsection ] ) for the cross section is inconsistent with the data within the error @xmath126 . 
 ( 0,0 )    ( 4647,3843)(1339,-5473 ) ( 4231,-3391)(0,0)[lb ] ( 2611,-1726)(0,0)[lb ] ( 5986,-3661)(0,0)[lb ] ( 3401,-3796)(0,0)[lb ] ( 3601,-3166)(0,0)[lb ]    such constraints can be useful to find the physical set of couplings when the solution of ( [ mean ] ) from the measurement of the optimal observables is not unique . 
 if they are strong enough they might even restrict the couplings to the region where ( [ mean ] ) can be linearised and thus simplify their extraction . 
 one can of course use the information from the integrated cross section working with any set of couplings , but again the situation is particularly simple with the form ( [ xsectransf ] ) . 
 we note that the information from the total rate is complementary to what is extracted from the mean values of our observables , which involve normalised kinematical distributions . from an experimental point of view their respective measurements 
 will presumably have quite different systematic errors . 
 let us also recall that the the measurement of the mean values @xmath26 times the number @xmath45 of events obtained with a fixed integrated luminosity combines the information of both @xcite . 
 a nonlinear data analysis as presented in sec . 
 [ sec : method ] can also be done in this case . 
 we draw attention to the fact that unphysical solutions of equation  ( [ mean ] ) for @xmath26 and of its analogue for @xmath133 will in general be different . 
 we shall however not elaborate on this point here . 
 another aspect of the couplings with the property ( [ xsectransf ] ) is the following . 
 it is well known that constant coupling parameters deviating from the standard model tree level values lead to amplitudes that violate unitarity @xcite . 
 the coefficients @xmath134 and @xmath135 in the total cross section @xmath103 increase strongly with the @xmath3 c.m . 
 energy @xmath136 and the couplings @xmath18 must vanish as @xmath8 becomes large to ensure a decent high - energy behaviour of @xmath103 . in our new parametrisation the quadratic coefficients in @xmath137 are energy independent , and in this sense the new couplings are at a `` natural scale '' at every energy .    to complete this section 
 we show that a transformation with the properties we require always exists , i.e.  that we can find a matrix @xmath111 that diagonalises @xmath68 in ( [ matrixtransf ] ) and transforms @xmath138 in ( [ quadrattransf ] ) to the unit matrix . 
 the argument is analogous if one replaces @xmath68 with @xmath50 . by construction 
 both @xmath68 and @xmath138 are symmetric and positive definite , so our problem is the same as finding normal coordinates for a multidimensional harmonic oscillator in classical mechanics ( cf . 
 e.g.  @xcite ) . to make this analogy transparent 
 let us write @xmath139 and @xmath140 ; we then have to find @xmath111 so that @xmath141 with @xmath142 being diagonal 
 . the elements @xmath143 of @xmath142 are generalised eigenvalues of @xmath144 satisfying @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the @xmath99-th column vector of @xmath111 . 
 the solution is well known to be @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the orthogonal matrix that transforms @xmath149 to @xmath142 . of course one 
 need not use ( [ solution ] ) in practice as there are convenient algorithms available to find @xmath111 and @xmath142 . in our numerical calculations 
 we have used the routine ` eigenvals ` of the algebraic package maple . 
 we will now give some numerical examples of our method described in the previous section . in this section 
 we will stay within the framework of a leading order analysis of the observables . 
 we start from the results in @xcite , where the sensitivity of optimal observables for semileptonic @xmath150-decays was calculated . 
 we assume a full kinematical reconstruction of the final state , except for the ambiguity one is left with if the jet charge is not known . for the standard model cross section we use the born approximation and neglect effects of the finite @xmath2 width . 
 to describe the triple boson couplings we take the form factors @xmath151 , @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) of @xcite ; deviations from their standard model tree level values will be referred to as `` anomalous couplings '' . 
 let us first look at a c.m . 
 energy of @xmath12 , which will be attained at lep2 . 
 the coefficient matrix @xmath115 can be found in table  4 of @xcite and in table  [ tab : coeff190 ] here we give the diagonal elements of the transformed matrix @xmath118 , ordered according to the symmetry of the corresponding observables . 
 the one standard deviation ellipsoid is diagonal in the couplings @xmath104 , thus its intersections with the coordinate axes equal its projections on these axes . 
 the errors @xmath154 setting all other @xmath155 to zero are then equal to the errors @xmath156 where all other @xmath155 are arbitrary . 
 they are given by @xmath157 and are listed in table  [ tab : sens190 ] for an integrated luminosity of @xmath13 . 
 we immediately remark that a negative diagonal element occurs in the transformed coefficient matrix , which is not allowed because @xmath158 is a covariance matrix and thus positive definite . 
 we encounter here a problem of numerical instability : small errors in the calculation of the original matrices @xmath115 and @xmath138 can have a large effect on the smallest generalised eigenvalues @xmath159 and their eigenvectors , even to the point that eigenvalues come out with the wrong sign . 
 this is not only a problem of our particular way of diagonalisation , but also occurs if one diagonalises @xmath115 with an orthogonal matrix ; we find that one of the usual eigenvalues of @xmath115 in the subspace of couplings with symmetry @xmath95 is negative . 
 such instabilities can cause large errors in the matrix inversion of @xmath115 and @xmath50 . 
 one needs @xmath160 to calculate the error on the extracted couplings as can be seen from ( [ chi ] ) and ( [ couplingscov ] ) , and large errors on @xmath161 can lead to large uncertainties in the extracted couplings , irrespective of whether @xmath161 is explicitly used to solve the system ( [ mean ] ) . 
 one will of course aim to calculate @xmath115 and @xmath50 with best possible precision , but such an effort has limits , in particular if they are determined from simulated events and include for instance radiative corrections or detector effects . on a more fundamental level any calculation of these matrices will only be an approximation of the `` exact '' ones that correspond to the kinematical distributions seen in experiment . in this sense 
 it seems quite inevitable that small eigenvalues ( the usual or our generalised ones ) of @xmath115 and @xmath50 and their eigenvectors are sensitive to imprecisions in the calculation and can lead to large errors or uncertainties in the data analysis . 
 this holds of course even if one does not obtain eigenvalues with the wrong sign . 
 we think that also in view of this a diagonalisation is useful , not because it solves the problem but because it makes it explicit ! 
 it allows to easily identify those combinations of couplings which have small corresponding eigenvalues in @xmath115 and @xmath50 and will be the most unsafe ones in the analysis . from ( [ onesigma ] ) 
 we see that they are those combinations for which the statistical errors will be largest . here 
 the most unsafe coupling parameter is @xmath162 . 
 one might thus choose to exclude it , and possibly other couplings , from the analysis and work in the remaining subspace of the @xmath104 where the numerics is more stable and where in any case the experiment is most sensitive . 
 we will come back to this in sec . 
 [ sec : practice ] . 
 .[tab : lr190]diagonal elements @xmath159 of the coefficient matrix restricted to the left or right handed subspace of the couplings as explained in the text . 
 the values in the left handed subspace differ from the corresponding ones in table 1 by at most 3% .

 let us sketch how our method of simultaneous diagonalisation might be used in practice .    1 . 
 one first has to choose which matrix to diagonalise simultaneously with @xmath138 . 
 these matrices need not be the same ones to be used in the data analysis itself but may be calculated under further approximations . 
 covariance matrices for the observables and extracted couplings can be evaluated for zero @xmath18 as our entire procedure will only have its desired properties if nonlinear effects are not too large . if one uses the same approximation of the differential cross section ( [ diffxsection ] ) for the construction of the optimal observables ( [ optimal ] ) and the calculation of @xmath115 , @xmath50 and @xmath117 then the latter are all equal and can be diagonalised at the same time . 
 otherwise one has to choose a positive definite symmetric matrix for the diagonalisation , i.e.  one of the covariance matrices . 
 the calculation of @xmath80 or of its inverse from ( [ couplingscov ] ) involves however a matrix inversion and might suffer from numerical instabilities , so presumably the best choice will be @xmath50 . 
 2 .   in the next step one carries out the simultaneous diagonalisation of the chosen matrix and @xmath138 as described in sec . 
 [ sec : simultan ] and determines the transformation matrix @xmath111 in ( [ couplingstransf ] ) to ( [ matrixtransf ] ) . at this point 
 it will be useful to test the numerical stability of the transformed matrices , for instance by re - calculating them in the new basis of couplings or by repeating the diagonalisation procedure with slightly modified initial matrices . 
 one might choose to discard some of the new couplings @xmath104 and the corresponding observables from the analysis if the corresponding matrix elements are found to be instable . 
 this does not mean that one has to set these couplings to zero . from the measurement of the total cross section one will obtain limits on them , which will also allow to control the contribution they can give to the mean values of those observables that are kept in the analysis because the matrix @xmath118 is not exactly diagonal and because of nonlinear terms in ( [ mean ] ) . 
 3 .   in the new parametrisation of the couplings 
 one then carries out the analysis of the data . here 
 @xmath164 , @xmath118 , @xmath165 and the other coefficients in ( [ expect ] ) will be determined under the most realistic assumptions and with the best precision one can afford . 
 they will not be exactly diagonal in practice , but should have small off - diagonal elements if the approximations made in step 1 .  and in the construction of the optimal observables are sufficiently good . 
 4 .   one can then give both single and multidimensional errors on the measured coupling parameters @xmath104 . at this stage one can also present the results in other , more conventional parametrisations of the couplings and 
 in particular compare with the measurements of other experiments , restricting oneself to whatever subspace of couplings might have been chosen there . 
 in the first part of this paper we have shown how to extract coupling parameters from the measured mean values @xmath26 of appropriate observables without the approximation that the couplings are small . 
 errors on the couplings can be obtained from a @xmath47-fit of the @xmath26 . if one puts constraints on the couplings in order to reduce their number the method also gives an indication of how compatible these constraints are with the data . 
 the `` optimal observables '' discussed in @xcite have statistical errors equal to the smallest possible ones to leading order in the coupling parameters @xmath18 . beyond the leading order approximation 
 one can obtain more sensitive observables if one has some previous estimate @xmath58 for the couplings , expanding the differential cross section around @xmath58 instead of zero and constructing observables from the corresponding expansion coefficients . in the appendix 
 we show that up to linear reparametrisations the choice of optimal observables is unique : any other set of observables must give bigger ( statistical ) errors .    in a second part 
 we have proposed to perform the data analysis using a particular parametrisation @xmath104 of the couplings , which is specific to the process and its c.m .  energy . 
 it is obtained from the initial set @xmath18 by a linear transformation which diagonalises the covariance matrix @xmath50 of the observables and transforms the matrix @xmath138 of quadratic coefficients in the integrated cross section ( [ intxsection ] ) to unity . in an idealised framework each optimal observable @xmath107 for this parametrisation is only sensitive to one coupling , and the statistical errors on the extracted couplings are uncorrelated . under realistic circumstances both properties can be approximately satisfied provided that the analysis stays in a region of parameter space where the dependence of the mean values @xmath166 on the couplings is not far from linear . 
 various matrices are then approximately diagonal which should generally facilitate the data analysis . in particular one can directly give errors on single or a small number of couplings , which will be necessary to obtain statistically significant results with a limited number of events . at the same time one can readily present multidimensional errors in parameter space , which is essential to compare with the results of measurements that impose various different constraints on the couplings . having approximately diagonal matrices also allows to easily identify those directions in parameter space which can be measured best and those for which the statistical errors will be large and which are likely to be associated with numerical instabilities , for example in matrix inversions . 
 one can thus recognise and seek to remedy such problems in an early stage of the analysis . 
 the measurement of the total cross section @xmath103 gives valuable complementary information on the coupling parameters . 
 its dependence on the couplings is particularly simple in the parametrisation we propose since the quadratic contributions are @xmath167 times the standard model cross section @xmath168 , i.e.  they have the same form for all couplings 
 . a measurement of @xmath103 will then restrict the @xmath104 to a shell between two hyperspheres in parameter space . 
 we have given some numerical examples of our method applied to the semileptonic decay channels in @xmath4 . 
 in particular we find that the couplings @xmath104 which can be measured best with unpolarised beams predominantly appear in the amplitude for left handed electrons ( or right handed positrons ) , and that the @xmath104 with the largest statistical errors mainly correspond to the opposite lepton helicity . 
 comparing our results at lep2 and lc energies we see that the coefficients in the linear contributions of the couplings @xmath104 to our observables and to the integrated cross section change much less with energy than in usual parametrisations . 
 this is because in the new parametrisation the quadratic coefficients in the normalised cross section @xmath169 are by construction energy independent .

 in this appendix we show that the set of observables ( [ newoptimal ] ) , obtained from expanding the differential cross section about the actual values of the couplings , is unique in the sense that up to the linear reparametrisations ( [ reparam ] ) it is the only set of @xmath41 integrated observables which in the limit of large @xmath45 leads to the minimum error on the @xmath41 extracted parameters .    to keep our notation simple we give the proof for the case that the actual values of the @xmath18 are zero .

 is given by ( [ couplingscov ] ) . under a linear reparametrisation of observables , @xmath172 where @xmath173 and @xmath174 are constants and the matrix @xmath173 is nonsingular , the matrices @xmath115 from ( [ obscoeffcompact ] ) and @xmath50 transform according to @xmath175 from ( [ couplingscov ] ) we see that the covariance matrix @xmath80 is unchanged under such a transformation . 
 for our proof we can hence restrict ourselves to observables with mean value @xmath176 = 0\ ] ] and with a coefficient matrix @xmath177 . from ( [ obscoeffcompact ] ) 
 we then have the condition @xmath178 = \delta_{ij}\ ] ] and the error on the extracted couplings is given by @xmath179   { \hspace{6pt}.}\ ] ]    from @xcite we know that the optimal observables ( [ optimal ] ) lead to the smallest possible error on the @xmath18 , given by the cramr - rao bound . to satisfy our conditions

 . otherwise some of the parameters @xmath18 are superfluous and can be eliminated ; our assumption is thus that the @xmath18 are an independent set of parameters for the anomalous couplings . 
 linear independence of the @xmath182 guarantees that @xmath183 is nonsingular , which has tacitly been used at several instances in our paper . 
 the set @xmath184 is related to the optimal observables @xmath185 by a linear transformation ( [ reparam ] ) and thus gives the same optimal error matrix @xmath80 . 
 the covariance @xmath186 $ ] defines a scalar product on the hilbert space @xmath187 of sufficiently smooth functions of @xmath21 with the property @xmath188 = 0 $ ] . 
 the functions @xmath184 span a subspace @xmath189 of @xmath187 , and we define @xmath190 as the orthogonal complement of @xmath189 with respect to the scalar product @xmath33 $ ] . 
 any set of @xmath41 observables satisfying ( [ centred ] ) can then be written as @xmath191 with @xmath192 , @xmath193 . further decomposing @xmath194 and using the constraint ( [ normalised ] ) we obtain @xmath195 , i.e.@xmath196 finally 
 , we have from ( [ simplecov ] ) , ( [ decompose ] ) , ( [ first ] ) @xmath197 +                n^{-1 } v_0[{{\cal o}}^{\it ii}_i , { { \cal o}}^{\it ii}_j ]   { \hspace{6pt}.}\ ] ] the first term gives the error on the couplings for the optimal observables @xmath184 , which is minimal . if the observables @xmath28 have minimal error , too , the second term must be zero , so that for each @xmath99 we have @xmath198 = 0 $ ] and thus @xmath199 which completes our proof .    in sec . 
 [ sec : simultan ] we mentioned that instead of @xmath26 one may use the product @xmath200 measured with fixed luminosity to extract the couplings @xcite . by an argument analogous to the one of this appendix one finds that up to linear reparametrisations our observables ( [ newoptimal ] ) are again the only optimal ones . 
 in this case linear reparametrisations have to be homogeneous , i.e.  one must have @xmath201 in ( [ reparam ] ) , since adding constants to the observables can change the induced errors on the coupling parameters .

32,"the standard model is greatly successful but it still has many free parameters which must be small to describe nature . while its supersymmetric extensions , e.g. ,  the minimal supersymmetric standard model , are attractive scenarios , small couplings are also required to explain observed facts such as the fermion mass hierarchy and mixing angles .    in recent years , extra dimensions have cast a new perspective on physics beyond the standard model . 
 one of the important aspects of extra dimensional models is that bulk fields can be localized with finite - width wave - function profiles . 
 this fact provides us with a geometrical explanation for small numbers . 
 that is , with a configuration where some fields are separated from each other in the extra dimensional space , the couplings among them are generally suppressed . 
 then how and where fields are localized is an issue to be considered . from this viewpoint , extra dimensional models with a curved background 
 are interesting because fields could be localized depending on the shape of the background geometry . 
 one of the most famous examples of curved geometries is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model with the ads@xmath0 warped metric  @xcite . 
 field theories of vectors , spinors , and scalars have been studied on this background  @xcite-@xcite . 
 the localization behavior of zero - mode wave functions has interesting applications to phenomenology such as the suppression of unwanted operators . 
 for example , hierarchical forms of yukawa couplings and proton decay were studied in  @xcite . 
 the localization of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excited modes also leads to interesting phenomena . 
 for instance , the localization of higher kk gauge bosons could realize a composite scalar ( higgs ) condensation , which induces dynamical ( electroweak ) symmetry breaking on the brane where the kk gauge bosons localize  @xcite . 
 in addition , models on more complicated backgrounds where a warp factor oscillates generate bulk fields which localize at some points in extra dimensions  @xcite . this type of localization might be useful in explaining the observed phenomena . 
 however extra dimensional theories are generally nonrenormalizable and the calculations depend on the regularization scheme that one adopts . furthermore , 
 extra dimensional theories are constrained by symmetries of higher dimensions . 
 for example , in the supersymmetric case , bulk theories are constrained by @xmath5 supersymmetry in five dimensions . 
 motivated by these facts , recently a four - dimensional ( 4d ) description of extra dimensional models was proposed  @xcite . with this method 
 , the phenomena of higher dimensional models are reproduced in terms of 4d theories , and several interesting models have been proposed along this line  @xcite .    in this paper 
 , we present 4d gauge theories that describe physics on 5d curved geometries . 
 as will be discussed below , taking generic values of gauge couplings and gauge - symmetry - breaking vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , the models provide vector , spinor , and scalar fields on curved extra dimensions . as a good and simple illustration 
 , we compare our 4d model with the rs one . 
 we particularly focus on the `` localization '' behaviors of mass eigenstates in `` index spaces '' of gauge groups . 
 it will be shown that the localization profiles and the exponentially suppressed massive spectrum are certainly reproduced . 
 in addition , our formulation gives a localization mechanism even for massless vector fields . as a phenomenological application , 
 hierarchical yukawa matrices are derived in our approach ; that is a hierarchy without symmetries in four dimensions . 
 the localization behavior depends on the required conditions for gauge - symmetry - breaking vevs and gauge and other couplings . 
 if these values are determined in the underlying theories , it may be said that the physics on warped backgrounds is dynamically generated within a four - dimensional framework . 
 we consider several possibilities to realize the conditions by utilizing , for example , strongly coupled gauge theories . 
 thus this could provide a purely 4d dynamical approach for small numbers . 
 we will proceed with the argument as follows . in sec . 
 [ sec : dwd ] , we describe our 4d gauge theories , which have generic ( nonuniversal ) values of gauge - symmetry - breaking vevs and couplings . 
 the models provide vector , spinor , and scalar fields in warped extra dimensions . 
 it is also shown that supersymmetry multiplets in flat 4d models generate supersymmetry multiplets on warped backgrounds . in sec . 
 [ sec : ne ] , we then numerically determine with a finite number of gauge groups that the formulation given in sec . 
 2 certainly reproduces various properties of bulk fields on the rs background . 
 in addition , a phenomenological application to quark mass matrices is also given . finally , we discuss possibilities of dynamically realizing the conditions required for curved geometries in sec . 
 [ sec : ddwd ] . 
 we conclude the discussion in sec . 
 [ sec : conclusion ] . 
 the appendix is devoted to a brief review of 5d bulk fields on a rs background . 
 following refs . 
 @xcite , we introduce @xmath6 gauge theories with gauge couplings @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , and scalar fields @xmath9 [ @xmath10 which are in bifundamental representations of @xmath11 . 
 the system is schematized by the segment diagram in fig . 
 [ fig : links ] . 
 the gauge invariant kinetic term of the scalars @xmath9 is written by @xmath12 where the covariant derivative is given by @xmath13 . 
 we assume that the scalar fields @xmath9 develop vevs proportional to the unit matrix , @xmath14 , which break the gauge symmetry to a diagonal @xmath15 . from the kinetic term ( [ eq : qkin ] ) , the mass terms for the vector fields @xmath16 are obtained : @xmath17 where the @xmath18 matrix @xmath19 is defined as @xmath20    the consequence of these mass terms is that we have a massless gauge boson corresponding to the unbroken gauge symmetry , which is given by the following linear combination : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the gauge coupling of the low - energy gauge theory @xmath15 . 
 the profile of @xmath24 is independent of the values of @xmath25 . 
 it is found from this that the massless vector field is `` localized '' at the points with smaller gauge couplings . 
 if the gauge couplings take a universal value @xmath26 , the massless mode @xmath27 has a constant `` wave function '' along the `` index space '' of gauge groups . as seen below , this direction labeled by @xmath28 
 becomes the fifth spatial dimension in the continuum limit ( @xmath29 ) . 
 the localization behavior can easily be understood from the fact that , for smaller gauge coupling @xmath7 , the symmetry - breaking scale @xmath30 of @xmath6 becomes lower , and hence the corresponding vector field @xmath16 becomes the more dominant component in the low - energy degree of freedom @xmath27 . 
 it is interesting to note that this vector localization mechanism ensures charge universality . 
 suppose that there is a field in a nontrivial representation of @xmath6 only . 
 that is , it couples only to @xmath31 with strength @xmath7 . 
 this corresponds to a four - dimensional field confined on a brane . 
 if there are several such fields , they generally have different values of gauge couplings . 
 however , note that these fields couple to the massless modes @xmath24 with a _ 
 universal _ gauge coupling @xmath23 defined above . 
 this is because , in the presented mechanism , the vector fields are localized depending on the values of the gauge couplings .    as for massless eigenstates , 
 the mass eigenvalues and wave functions are obtained by diagonalizing the mass matrix ( [ eq : diffop ] ) . 
 the simplest case is the universal couplings @xmath32 in this case , one obtains the mass eigenvalues of @xmath19 as @xmath33 in the limit @xmath29 with @xmath34 fixed ( the limit to continuum 5d theory ) , the eigenvalues become @xmath35 these are the same spectrum as that of the bulk gauge boson in the @xmath36 extra dimension with radius @xmath37 .    with generic values of vevs @xmath25 and gauge couplings 
 @xmath7 , the situation is rather complicated . in this case , the mass term ( [ eq : gau - mass ] ) of the vector fields becomes @xmath38(a_\mu^{i+1})^2    \nonumber \\[1 mm ]    & & + \frac{1}{2}v_n^2g_n(g_{n+1}-g_n)(a_\mu^n)^2    -\frac{1}{2 } v_1 ^ 2g_1(g_2-g_1)(a_\mu^1)^2 . 
 \label{eq : gbbm}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the first term becomes the kinetic energy transverse to the four dimensions in the continuum limit . on the other hand , 
 the second and third terms are bulk and brane mass terms , respectively . 
 it should be noted that these mass terms vanish in the case of universal gauge coupling , which corresponds to a flat massless vector field in 5d theory as discussed above . in other words , 
 nonuniversal gauge couplings generate bulk / brane mass terms and cause a localization of the wave function . 
 first we consider the series of vevs @xmath25 and couplings @xmath7 that generates a vector field on the rs warped background , namely , the ads@xmath0 background . 
 this model can be obtained by choosing a universal @xmath7 and by varying @xmath25 as @xmath39 substituting this and taking the continuum limit , eq . 
 ( [ gkt ] ) becomes @xmath40 ^ 2 , \label{eq : contlimrs}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath41 represents the coordinate of the extra dimension : @xmath42 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath43 , etc . 
 it is found that eq . 
 ( [ eq : contlimrs ] ) successfully induces the kinetic energy term along the extra dimension and mass terms for the vector field on the warped background metric @xmath44 where @xmath45 with @xmath46 . 
 we here conclude that we can obtain the vector field on a rs warped background by varying only the vevs @xmath25 . in the following 
 we will see that nonuniversal gauge couplings @xmath7 induce other interesting results beyond the effects from the background metric . 
 now let us compare the 4d model with generic couplings ( [ eq : gbbm ] ) to extra dimensional ones . 
 we define the dimensionless parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 as @xmath49 first we restrict ourselves to the case that the gauge group is @xmath50 , namely , abelian theory with _ no vector self - couplings_. similarly substituting eq . 
 ( [ eq : deffh ] ) and taking the continuum limit , eq . 
 ( [ gkt ] ) becomes @xmath51\bigr]^2 . 
 \label{eq : contlim}\end{aligned}\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : contlim ] ) induces the kinetic energy term along the extra dimension and mass terms for the vector field on the warped background metric : @xmath52 ^ 2 \eta_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu - dy^2 . 
 \label{eq : generalbkg}\ ] ] the bulk and boundary mass terms are @xmath41 dependent and proportional to the derivatives of @xmath53 . 
 this is also seen from the 4d model [ the second and third terms in eq . 
 ( [ eq : gbbm ] ) ] . 
 the above is a generic correspondence between our 4d case and continuum 5d theory . as an example , consider the following forms of the parameters : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a positive constant with mass dimension @xmath56 . 
 equation ( [ eq : contlim ] ) leads to @xmath57    -\frac{1}{2}\biggl[\zeta ke^{-2(\zeta+\eta)ky }    ( a_\mu)^2\biggr]_0^{l/2}.   \label{eq : wgmbbm}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the first term on the right hand side is the kinetic term of the gauge boson along the extra dimension with the warped background @xmath58 the second and third terms correspond to the bulk and boundary masses announced before . 
 as easily seen , the above equation includes the expression for vector fields on the rs background . in the 5d rs model 
 , the lagrangian for vector fields is written as ( see the appendix ) @xmath59 where the @xmath60 gauge fixing condition is chosen . by comparing eq . 
 ( [ eq : wgmbbm ] ) with eq . 
 ( [ rsgauge ] ) , we find that the case with @xmath61 realizes vector fields on the rs background . 
 also , a special limit , @xmath62 , produces the flat zero - mode solution . 
 that corresponds to the form of the parameters ( [ eq : rsparaf ] ) in the previous special argument . 
 the other solutions which satisfy @xmath63 correspond to nonflat wave functions of the zero - mode vector field on the rs background . 
 it is clearly understood in our formulation that such nonflat wave functions are caused by introducing bulk and/or boundary mass terms in the rs model . 
 for example , in the case of @xmath64 , the vector field has bulk and boundary mass terms , and is localized with a peak at the @xmath65 point . 
 it should be noticed that with these bare mass terms the zero mode is still massless . 
 this is understood from our formulation where the gauge symmetry @xmath66 is left unbroken in the low - energy effective theory .      in the above abelian case we discussed interpretation of the nonuniversal @xmath47 as @xmath41-dependent bulk or boundary masses in the warped extra dimension . 
 next we treat the non - abelian theory with vector self - couplings . 
 since in this case we also have @xmath41-dependent vector self - couplings in addition to the @xmath41-dependent bulk or boundary masses , it may be convenient and instructive to see @xmath47 as a @xmath41-dependent coefficient of the vector kinetic term . 
 to this end , we define the four - dimensional field @xmath67 , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the lattice spacing , which goes to zero in the continuum limit . rescaling the gauge fields @xmath70 , the kinetic term @xmath71 and eq . 
 ( [ eq : qkin ] ) become @xmath72   \nonumber \\ & & \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad   \qquad \qquad               + i \hat{g } a_5^{i+1/2 } ( a^{i+1}_\mu - a^i_\mu )              + { \cal o}(a^{1/2 } ) \bigg|^2 ,   \label{eq : gqkin2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in the continuum limit @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 fixed , eq . 
 ( [ eq : gqkin2 ] ) results in @xmath78 ^ 2 \eta^{\mu \nu } f_{\mu 5 } f_{\nu 5 }         \big\},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath79 $ ] . 
 this completely reproduces the 5d yang - mills kinetic term with a @xmath41-dependent coefficient @xmath80 on the warped - background metric ( [ eq : generalbkg ] ) , provided that @xmath81 . 
 this is the generic correspondence between the present 4d model and continuum 5d theory . from eq . 
 ( [ eq:5dym ] ) , we thus find the @xmath41-dependent factor @xmath82 in front of the canonical yang - mills term , which corresponds to a 5d dilaton vev . 
 the factor does carry the origin of the massless vector localization shown in eq . 
 ( [ zero - a ] ) . with the constant gauge coupling @xmath83 ( @xmath47 = 1 ) 
 , one obtains a bulk vector field with a constant zero mode on the warped metric ( [ eq : generalbkg ] ) . 
 a field redefinition @xmath84 in eq . 
 ( [ eq:5dym ] ) gives the previous bulk and boundary mass terms but one then has @xmath41-dependent vector self - couplings in non - abelian cases . 
 we next consider spinor fields by arranging fermions of fundamental or antifundamental representation in each gauge theory @xmath6 . 
 we introduce two weyl ( one dirac ) spinors to construct a 5d bulk fermion . 
 the orbifold compactification in continuum theory requires that one spinor obeys the neumann boundary condition and the other the dirichlet one . in the present 4d model , 
 this can be achieved by having asymmetrical numbers of fundamental and antifundamental spinors , resulting in chiral fermions in the low - energy gauge theory . here 
 we consider the fundamental weyl spinors @xmath85 ( @xmath8 ) in the @xmath6 theory and the antifundamental @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) . 
 as seen below , @xmath88 corresponds to the bulk fermion with the neumann boundary condition and @xmath89 to that with the dirichlet one . 
 the generic gauge - invariant mass and the mixing terms of @xmath85 and @xmath86 are written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are dimensionless coupling constants . 
 we assume that @xmath9 develop vevs @xmath93 . the mass matrix for spinors 
 is then given by @xmath94 the spinor mass eigenvalues and eigenvectors ( wave functions ) are read from this matrix . 
 one easily sees that the massless mode is contained in @xmath88 and given by the following linear combination : @xmath95 therefore the localization profile of zero mode depends on the ratio of dimensionless couplings @xmath91 and @xmath92 . 
 a simple case is @xmath96 for all @xmath28 . in this case 
 , @xmath97 corresponds to a chiral zero mode obtained from a 5d bulk fermion on the flat background . if @xmath98 , the system describes a fermion with a curved wave - function profile . 
 for example , if @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , @xmath97 has a monotonically increasing ( decreasing ) wave - function profile . as another interesting example 
 , taking @xmath101 ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 are constants and @xmath104 ) , @xmath97 has a gaussian profile with a peak at @xmath105 . 
 other profiles of massless chiral fermions could also be realized in our approach . 
 let us discuss the 5d continuum limit . 
 the relevant choice of couplings @xmath91 and @xmath92 is @xmath106 the parameters @xmath107 give rise to a bulk bare mass in the continuum limit as will be seen below . 
 the only difference between the vector and spinor cases is the existence of possible bulk mass parameters [ see eqs . 
 ( [ eq : diffop ] ) and ( [ eq : mass - spi ] ) ] . 
 the mass and mixing terms  ( [ eq : fermionmoose ] ) then become @xmath108 + \textrm{h.c.},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the same as defined in the case of vector fields  ( [ eq : deffh ] ) . 
 similar to the vector case , this form is compared with the bulk spinor lagrangian in the rs space - time ( see the appendix ) @xmath111 . 
 \label{eq : rsspinor}\end{aligned}\ ] ] here the kinetic terms have been canonically normalized in order to compare them to the 4d model . in eq . 
 ( [ eq : rsspinor ] ) , @xmath102 is a possible 5d dirac mass , and the `` 1/2 '' contribution in the mass terms comes from the spin connection with the rs metric . 
 it is interesting that the 5d spinor lagrangian ( [ eq : rsspinor ] ) is reproduced by taking the exact same limit of parameters as that in the vector case , defined by eq . 
 ( [ eq : rsparaf ] ) . 
 furthermore , the relation between the mass parameters @xmath102 should be taken as @xmath112 that is , the @xmath107 s take a universal value . 
 now the localization behavior of the spinors is easily understood . in the present 4d model , 
 the spinor mass matrix ( [ eq : mass - spi ] ) becomes with eq . 
 ( [ eq : spinorcond ] ) @xmath113 a vanishing bulk mass parameter @xmath114 corresponds to @xmath115 , that is , @xmath116 in our model . 
 then the mass matrix @xmath117 is exactly the same as @xmath19 , and their mass eigenvalues and eigenstates are the same . in particular 
 , the massless mode @xmath97 has a flat wave function with universal gauge couplings as considered here . 
 this is consistent with the expression ( [ zero - eta ] ) , where the ratio @xmath118 determines the wave - function profile . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) 
 , the rs zero - mode spinor is localized at @xmath121 ( @xmath65 )  @xcite , which in turn corresponds to @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) in our model . 
 one can see from the spinor mass matrix ( [ eq : mass - rsspi ] ) that the zero - mode wave function is monotonically increasing ( decreasing ) with respect to the index @xmath28 .    in this way 
 , we have a 4d localization mechanism for the spinor fields . 
 nonuniversal gauge couplings or nonuniversal masses give rise to a nonflat wave function for a chiral massless fermion . 
 the latter option is not realized for vector fields . 
 notice that the charge universality still holds in the low - energy effective theory . 
 that is , with any complicated wave - function profiles , zero modes interact with a universal value of the gauge coupling . 
 this is because curved profiles of vector fields depend only on the gauge couplings . 
 finally we consider scalar fields . 
 we may introduce two types of scalar field @xmath124 and @xmath125 in the fundamental and antifundamental representations of @xmath6 , respectively . 
 in addition , for each type of scalar , there are two choices of the @xmath126 parity assignment in the continuum limit . 
 this orbifolding procedure is incorporated by removing @xmath127 or @xmath128 . 
 the gauge invariant mass and mixing terms for @xmath129 and @xmath130 are written as @xmath131 where @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 are the dimensionless coupling constants . 
 it is implicitly assumed that nonintroduced fields are appropriately removed in the sums . 
 we have included the mixing mass terms up to the nearest - neighbor interactions . 
 other invariant terms such as @xmath135 or terms containing @xmath9 correspond to nonlocal interactions in 5d theories , and we do not consider these in this paper . 
 notice , however , that for a supersymmetric case , these terms may be suppressed due to renormalizability and holomorphy of the superpotential . 
 the zero - mode eigenstates are given in the same form as that of the spinor shown in the previous section , replacing @xmath132 and @xmath133 by @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) . 
 therefore the ratio @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) determines the zero - mode wave function . 
 let us consider the continuum 5d limit . 
 in what follows , we remove @xmath128 , which corresponds to the @xmath126 assignment @xmath142 and @xmath143 . 
 the 5d limit can be achieved by taking the following choices of couplings : @xmath144 & & \bar\alpha'_i \,=\ , g_{i+1 } , \qquad \bar\beta'_i \,=\ , g_{i+1}(1-\bar c'_{i+1}),\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath145 and @xmath146 correspond to the bulk mass parameters , as in the spinor case 
 . then the mass terms ( [ eq : nsp ] ) and ( [ eq : dsp ] ) for the scalars take the following forms with the parametrization ( [ eq : deffh ] ) : @xmath147\{f(y)\phi(x , y)\}\bigr|^2 + [ gv\gamma(y)]^2|f(y)\phi(x , y)|^2 \biggr],\ ] ] @xmath148\{h(y)\varphi(x , y)\ } \bigr|^2 + [ gv\bar\gamma(y)]^2|h(y)\varphi(x , y)|^2 \biggr].\ ] ]    as a special case , we compare @xmath129 and @xmath130 with the scalar fields in the rs space - time . 
 the scalar lagrangian on the rs background is ( see also the appendix ) @xmath149\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the 4d kinetic term is canonically normalized , and @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the bulk and boundary mass parameters , respectively , defined in the appendix [ eq . 
 ( [ eq : smass ] ) ] . by substituting the rs limit in our model given by eq . 
 ( [ eq : rsparaf ] ) , we find the relations between the mass parameters in 4d and 5d : @xmath152      in this subsection , we discuss 5d supersymmetry on warped backgrounds . 
 generally a supersymmetric theory may be obtained by relevant choices of couplings from a nonsupersymmetric theory . 
 we here examine whether it is possible to construct supersymmetric 4d models which describe 5d supersymmetric ones on warped backgrounds . 
 this is a nontrivial check for the ability of our formalism to properly describe 5d nature . in ref . 
 @xcite , the 5d theory on the ads@xmath0 rs background was studied . there 
 , supersymmetry on ads@xmath0 geometry was identified and then the conditions on the mass parameters imposed by this type of supersymmetry were derived ( also given in the appendix here ) . as seen below 
 , these relations among mass parameters for ads@xmath0 supersymmetry are indeed satisfied in our _ 
 4d formalism_. this fact seems remarkable in the sense that the present analyses do not include gravity . 
 first consider vector supermultiplets in 5d . 
 the scalar fields @xmath9 and the gauge bosons @xmath31 are extended to chiral and vector superfields in 4d , respectively . notice that the vevs that were discussed above , @xmath153 are in the ( baryonic ) @xmath154-flat direction . 
 we start with the following 4d supersymmetric lagrangian @xmath155 the bilinear terms of the component fields are written in the unitary gauge ( we follow the conventions of @xcite ) : @xmath156 where we have rescaled @xmath157 for canonical normalization of the kinetic terms . the mass matrix @xmath158 is defined in eq . 
 ( [ gkt ] ) . 
 the first term is nothing but eq . 
 ( [ gkt ] ) , that is , the mass terms for vector fields . by 
 also canonically normalizing @xmath159 and @xmath160 and integrating out the auxiliary fields , we find the mass terms for the adjoint spinors and scalar @xmath161 these masses have the same forms as that of the vector field because we started from a supersymmetric theory . 
 we thus have a model with @xmath162 for the spinors and @xmath163 for the scalar . 
 ( note that @xmath164 , which originate from @xmath9 , have @xmath126 odd parity . ) 
 it is a nontrivial check to see whether the above mass terms satisfy the conditions for 5d ads@xmath0 supersymmetry . 
 we find from the relations ( [ eq : ci - spi ] ) and ( [ eq : massd ] ) that the mass terms for @xmath165 and @xmath166 imply @xmath167 indeed , these relations are just those required by ads@xmath0 supersymmetry  @xcite . in this way , _ 
 5d vector supermultiplets on a rs warped background are automatically derived from a 4d supersymmetric model on a flat background_.    we also construct a 5d hypermultiplet in the warped extra dimension starting from a 4d supersymmetric theory . in order to have a hypermultiplet we introduce the chiral superfields @xmath124 and @xmath125 in the fundamental and antifundamental representations of the @xmath6 gauge theory . in the following , @xmath128 is removed to implement @xmath126 orbifolding which leaves a chiral zero mode of the fundamental representation . 
 the fermionic components of @xmath124 and @xmath125 , then correspond to @xmath85 and @xmath168 , respectively , in sec . 
 [ sec : spinor ] . 
 the generic renormalizable superpotential is written as @xmath169 this superpotential just leads to a spinor mass term of the form ( [ eq : fermionmoose ] ) . 
 in addition , the mass and mixing terms of the scalars @xmath129 and @xmath130 also have the same form as those of the spinors : @xmath170 supersymmetry induces equivalence between the boson and fermion mass matrices . in turn , this implies in our formulation given in the previous sections that the mass parameters are equal , @xmath171 and also @xmath172 . 
 thus , there is only one parameter @xmath102 left . 
 it is found from eqs . 
 ( [ eq : ci - spi ] ) , ( [ eq : massn ] ) , and ( [ eq : massd ] ) that if one take the continuum limit the relations @xmath173 are generated . 
 these mass relations are exactly those imposed by supersymmetry on the ads@xmath0 geometry  @xcite . 
 thus hypermultiplets on the rs background are properly incorporated in our formalism with a flat background . 
 it may be interesting that the mass relation for vector multiplets is the one for chiral multiplets with dirichlet boundary conditions ( [ eq : abchypd ] ) with @xmath114 . 
 this value of @xmath102 is the limit of vanishing bulk mass parameters . 
 it should be noticed that our analyses have been performed for generic warped backgrounds , including the rs case as a special limit . 
 we thus found that even in generic warped backgrounds the conditions on the bulk mass parameters required for 5d warped supersymmetry should be the same as for the rs case . 
 here we perform a numerical study to confirm our formulation of the curved extra dimension discussed in the previous sections . we will also give a phenomenological application to the hierarchy among yukawa couplings . 
 in the following , we consider the case that corresponds to the rs model in the continuum limit , as a good and simple application . the gauge couplings and vevs are specified as given in sec . 
 [ sec : dwd ] ; @xmath174 the universal gauge coupling @xmath26 implies that vector zero modes have flat wave functions as shown in eq . 
 ( [ zero - a ] ) . 
 the following is a summary of the mass terms for various spin fields , which were derived in the previous sections : @xmath175 { \cal l}_{fm } & = & -\psi d_c \eta + \textrm{h.c . } , \\[2 mm ] { \cal l}_{sm}^\phi & = & -\bigl|d_{3/2-b } \phi\bigr|^2 -|m \phi|^2 , \\[1 mm ] { \cal l}_{sm}^\varphi & = & -\bigl|d_{-(3/2-b)}^\dagger \varphi\bigr|^2 -|m^\dagger \varphi|^2.\end{aligned}\ ] ] the parameters @xmath151 and @xmath102 represent the bulk mass parameters for scalars and spinors , respectively . 
 the @xmath18 mass matrices @xmath176 and @xmath177 are defined as follows : @xmath178    m & = & \sqrt{a+4b - b^2}\,\frac{k}{v }    \pmatrix { v_1 & & \cr & \ddots & \cr & & v_{n-1 } }    \pmatrix { 1 &     0    &          &    \cr      & \ddots & \ddots   &    \cr      &         & 1 & 0 } , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath179 for supersymmetric cases , the mass matrices @xmath176 for bosons and fermions take the same form and , moreover , @xmath180 , as discussed previously . 
 we define the matrices @xmath181 that diagonalize the mass matrices for gauge , fermion , and scalar fields , respectively . for example 
 , @xmath182 satisfies @xmath183 where @xmath184 are the mass eigenvalues which should correspond to the kk spectrum of vector fields . in the following , we use the notation @xmath185 that is , the coefficients of @xmath31 in the @xmath186th massive eigenstates @xmath187 . in the continuum limit 
 , this corresponds to the value of the wave function at @xmath188 for the @xmath186th kk excited vector field . 
 similar definitions are made for spinors and scalars .    for vector fields , 
 we illustrate the resultant eigenvalues @xmath189 and eigenvectors @xmath190 in figs . 
 [ fig : bulkgaugesys](a)[fig : bulkgaugesys](f ) . for comparison 
 , we also show in the figures the wave functions and kk mass eigenvalues of vector fields on the rs background . 
 it is found from the figures that our 4d model completely reproduces the mode function profiles [ figs . 
 [ fig : bulkgaugesys](b ) , [ fig : bulkgaugesys](d ) , and [ fig : bulkgaugesys](f ) ] . localization becomes sharp as @xmath191 increases ; this situation is similar to the continuum case . 
 the warp - suppressed spectra of kk excited modes are also realized [ figs . 
 [ fig : bulkgaugesys](a ) , [ fig : bulkgaugesys](c ) , and [ fig : bulkgaugesys](e ) ] . for a larger @xmath192 ( the number of gauge groups ) 
 , the model leads to a spectrum more in agreement with the continuous rs case . 
 note , however , that the localization profiles of wave functions can be seen even with a rather small @xmath192 . 
 it is interesting that even with a finite number of gauge groups the massive modes have warp - suppressed spectra and localization profiles in the index space of gauge theory .    for fermion fields 
 , there is another interesting issue to be examined . 
 it is the localization behavior via dependence on the mass parameters @xmath102 , which was discussed in sec.[sec : spinor ] . 
 we show the @xmath102 dependence of the zero - mode wave function @xmath193 in fig . 
 [ fig : cdepwf ] . 
 the figure indicates that the zero - mode wave functions surely give the expected localization nature of the continuum rs limit [ eq .  ( [ eq : hzero ] ) in the appendix ] . 
 we find that the values of the wave functions are exponentially suppressed at the tail of localization profile even with a finite number of gauge groups . 
 the profiles of massive modes can also be reproduced . 
 now we apply our formulation to phenomenological problems in four dimensions . 
 let us use the localization behavior , which has been shown above , to obtain the yukawa hierarchy . 
 this issue has been studied in the 5d rs framework  @xcite . 
 we consider a model corresponding to the ( supersymmetric ) standard model in the bulk . 
 the yukawa couplings for quarks are given by @xmath194 where @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and @xmath197 denote the left - handed quarks and the right - handed up and down quarks , respectively , and @xmath198 are the family indices . 
 for simplicity , we study a supersymmetric case and introduce two types of higgs scalars @xmath199 and @xmath200 . 
 then the mass parameters of the higgs scalars satisfy eq . 
 ( [ eq : abchypn ] ) and they are denoted by @xmath201 in the following . 
 similarly , the quark behaviors are described by their mass parameters @xmath202 . 
 we assume @xmath203 . generally , in supersymmetric 5d models , yukawa couplings such as eq . 
 ( [ eq : yukawaorg ] ) are prohibited by 5d supersymmetry . however , since the present model is 4d , one may apply 5d - like results to yukawa couplings without respecting 5d consistency . 
 this is one of the benefits of our scheme . 
 we are now interested in the zero - mode part of eq . 
 ( [ eq : yukawaorg ] ) , which generates the following mass terms @xmath204 where the fields with tildes @xmath205 stand for the @xmath186th mass eigenstate given by @xmath206 ( similarly for @xmath196 , @xmath197 , and @xmath207 ) . 
 the effective yukawa couplings are @xmath208 and similarly for @xmath209 . a typical behavior of @xmath210 is shown in fig .  [ fig : cdepwf ] for several values of the bulk mass parameter @xmath102 . in fig . 
 [ fig : cdepy ] , we show the behaviors of the zero - mode yukawa couplings @xmath211 against the quark mass parameters . 
 two limiting cases with @xmath212 and 1 are shown . 
 the former corresponds to a bulk higgs scalar localized at @xmath65 and the latter to one at @xmath121 in the continuum rs limit . from the figures 
 , we see that if there is a @xmath213 difference of mass ratio among the generations , it generates a large hierarchy between yukawa couplings . 
 combined with the mechanisms that control mass parameters discussed in the next section , one obtains a hierarchy without symmetries within the four - dimensional framework . 
 \(a ) @xmath212    \(b ) @xmath214    \(c ) @xmath212 
 \(d ) @xmath214    in the case of @xmath214 , the yukawa coupling depends exponentially on the quark bulk mass parameters @xmath202 when @xmath215 .. for @xmath216 , the higgs scalars have a peak at @xmath217 ( @xmath121 ) . 
 this situation is different from the one discussed in ref . 
 @xcite where the higgs field is localized at @xmath218 ( @xmath65 ) . ] 
 this implies that if @xmath202 exist in this region one obtains the following form of the yukawa matrices : @xmath219 where their exponents satisfy @xmath220 this form is similar to that obtained by the froggatt - nielsen mechanism  @xcite with a @xmath50 symmetry . as an illustration , 
 let us take the following mass parameters @xmath221 and @xmath222 and @xmath223 , which generates the low - energy yukawa matrices @xmath224 where @xmath225 . 
 this pattern of quark mass textures leads to realistic quark masses and mixing angles  @xcite with a large value of the ratio @xmath226 . if the above analysis were extended to su(5 ) 
 grand unified theory , realistic lepton masses and mixing may be derived . 
 other forms of yukawa matrices that may be realized by the froggatt - nielsen mechanism are easily incorporated in our formulation .    for more complicated patterns of mass parameters , we could realize yukawa matrices that are different from those derived from the froggatt - nielsen mechanism . in general , 
 off - diagonal entries tend to be rather suppressed , that is , we have @xmath227 for the yukawa matrix ( [ yij ] ) 
 . such a form may lead to realistic fermion masses and mixing angles . 
 for example , one could derive the yukawa matrix @xmath228 if initial values of @xmath229 are sufficiently suppressed . in this case 
 , the @xmath230 submatrix for the second and third generations does not satisfy eq . 
 ( [ fntype ] ) . the yukawa matrix ( [ eq : compli ] ) 
 may be relevant to the down - quark sector , indeed studied in ref . 
 we do not pursue further systematic studies on these types of yukawa matrices in this paper . 
 we have shown that 4d models with nonuniversal vevs and gauge and other couplings can describe 5d physics on curved backgrounds , including the rs model with an exponential warp factor . in the continuum 5d 
 theory , this factor is derived as a solution of the equation of motion for gravity . on the other hand , in the 4d viewpoint , 
 warped geometries are generated by taking the couplings and vevs as appropriate forms . in the previous sections , 
 we have just assumed their typical forms and examined its consequences . 
 if one could identify how to control these couplings by the underlying _ dynamics _ , the resultant 4d theories turn out to provide attractive schemes to discuss low - energy physics such as tiny coupling constants . 
 first we consider the scalar vevs @xmath231 . a simple way to dynamically control them is to introduce additional strongly coupled gauge theories  @xcite . 
 consider the following set of asymptotically free gauge theories : @xmath232 where @xmath233 and @xmath234 denote the dynamical scales . 
 we have , for simplicity , assumed common values of @xmath235 and @xmath233 for all @xmath6 . 
 in addition , two types of fermions are introduced : @xmath236 where their representations under @xmath237 gauge groups are shown in parentheses . if @xmath238 , the @xmath239 theories are confined at a higher scale than @xmath6 , and the fermion bilinear composite scalars @xmath240 appear . 
 their vevs @xmath25 are given by the dynamical scales @xmath234 of the @xmath239 gauge theories through a dimensional transmutation as @xmath241 where @xmath242 is a universal one - loop gauge beta function for @xmath239 ( @xmath243 ) . 
 the gauge couplings @xmath244 generally take different values and thus lead to different values of @xmath25 . 
 for example , a linear dependence of @xmath245 on the index @xmath28 is amplified to an exponential behavior of @xmath25 . 
 that is , @xmath246 which reproduces the bulk fields on the rs background as shown before . 
 the index dependences of the gauge couplings are actually generic situations , and may also be controlled , for example , by some mechanism fixing dilatons or the radiatively induced kinetic terms discussed below . 
 a supersymmetric extension of the above scenario is achieved with quantum - deformed moduli spaces  @xcite . 
 another mechanism that dynamically induces nonuniversal vevs is obtained in supersymmetric cases . 
 consider the gauge group @xmath247 and the chiral superfields @xmath9 with charges @xmath248 under @xmath249 . 
 it is assumed that the scalar components @xmath250 of @xmath9 develop their vevs @xmath251 . 
 the @xmath154 term of each @xmath252 is given by @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the coefficient of the fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term , and the ellipsis denotes contributions from other fields charged under @xmath252 , which are assumed not to have vevs . 
 given nonvanishing fi terms , @xmath255 , the @xmath154-flatness conditions mean @xmath256 and nonuniversal vevs @xmath25 are indeed realized . in this case 
 , the dynamical origin of nonuniversal vevs is the nonvanishing fi terms . 
 these may be generated at the loop level . 
 furthermore , if the matter content is different for each gauge theory , the @xmath254 themselves have complicated forms . 
 above , we supposed that the charges of @xmath9 are @xmath248 under @xmath257 . 
 alternatively , if @xmath9 have charges @xmath258 under @xmath257 and other matter fields have integer charges , the gauge symmetry @xmath247 is broken to the product of a diagonal @xmath50 gauge symmetry and the discrete gauge symmetry @xmath259 
 . such discrete gauge symmetry would be useful for phenomenology  @xcite . 
 models with nonuniversal gauge couplings @xmath7 are also interesting in the sense that they can describe the localization of massless vector fields . 
 a nonuniversality of gauge couplings is generated , e.g. ,  in the case that the @xmath6 gauge theories have different matter content from each other . 
 then radiative corrections to gauge couplings and their renormalization - group running become nonuniversal , even if their initial values are equal . 
 this fact is also applicable to the above - mentioned mechanism for nonuniversal @xmath25 . 
 suppose that the @xmath239 theory contains ( @xmath260 ) vectorlike quarks which decouple at @xmath261 . 
 the gauge couplings @xmath262 are then determined by @xmath263 where we have assumed that the @xmath239 theories are strongly coupled at a high - energy scale @xmath264  ( @xmath265 ) . 
 tuning of the relevant matter content thus generates the desired linear dependence of @xmath245 . with these radiatively induced couplings ( [ eq : nonuni - g ] ) at hand , the vevs are determined from eq . 
 ( [ eq : dtvev ] ) : @xmath266 
 we have formulated 4d models that provide 5d field theories on generic warped backgrounds . 
 the warped geometries are achieved with generic values of symmetry - breaking vevs , gauge couplings , and other couplings in the models . 
 we focused on field localization behaviors along the index space of gauge theory ( the fifth dimension in the continuum limit ) , which is realized by taking relevant choices of the mass parameters . 
 as a good and simple application , we constructed 4d models corresponding to bulk field theories on the ads@xmath0 randall - sundrum background . 
 the localized wave functions of massless modes are completely reproduced with a finite number of gauge groups . 
 in addition , the exponentially suppressed spectrum of the kk modes is also generated . 
 these results imply that most properties of brane world models can be obtained within 4d gauge theories . 
 supersymmetric extensions were also investigated . in 5d warped models , 
 the bulk and boundary mass terms of spinors and scalars satisfy complicated forms imposed by supersymmetry on the rs background . 
 however , we show in our formalism that these forms of the mass terms are derived from a 4d _ global _ supersymmetric model on a _ 
 flat _ background .    as an application of our 4d formulation 
 , we derived hierarchical forms of yukawa couplings . 
 the zero modes of scalars and spinors with different masses have different wave - function profiles as in the 5d rs cases . 
 therefore by varying the @xmath213 mass parameters for each generation , one can obtain realistic yukawa matrices with a large hierarchy from the overlaps of the wave functions in a purely 4d framework . 
 other phenomenological issues such as proton stability , grand unified theory ( gut ) symmetry breaking , and supersymmetry breaking can also be discussed . 
 the conditions on the model parameters should be explained by some dynamical mechanisms if one considers the models from a fully 4d viewpoint . 
 one interesting way is to include additional strongly coupled gauge theories . in this case , a small @xmath213 difference between gauge couplings is converted to exponential profiles of symmetry - breaking vevs via dimensional transmutation , and indeed generates a warp factor of the rs model . a difference of gauge couplings 
 is achieved by , for example , the dynamics controlling dilatons , or radiative corrections to gauge couplings . 
 supersymmetrizing models provide a mechanism for dynamically realizing nonuniversal vevs with @xmath154-flatness conditions . 
 our formulation makes sense not only from the 4d points of view but also as a lattice - regularized 5d theory . in this sense , effects such as the ads / conformal field theory ( cft ) correspondence might be clearly seen with our formalism . as another application , it can be applied to construct various types of curved backgrounds and bulk or boundary masses . 
 for example , we discussed massless vector localization by varying the gauge couplings @xmath7 . 
 furthermore , one might consider models in which some fields are charged under only some of the gauge groups . 
 these seem not like bulk or brane fields , but `` quasi - bulk '' fields . 
 applications including these phenomena will be studied elsewhere .

 here we briefly review the field theory on a rs background , following ref . 
 one of the original motivations for introducing a warped extra dimension by randall and sundrum is to provide the weak planck mass hierarchy via the exponential factor in the space - time metric . 
 this factor is called `` warp factor , '' and the bulk space a `` warped extra dimension '' . 
 such a nonfactorizable geometry with a warp factor distinguishes the rs brane world from others . 
 consider the fifth dimension @xmath41 compactified on an orbifold @xmath270 with radius @xmath271 and two three - branes at the orbifold fixed points @xmath121 and @xmath272 . 
 the einstein equation for this five - dimensional setup leads to the solution  @xcite @xmath273 where @xmath55 is a constant with mass dimension @xmath56 . 
 let us study a vector field @xmath274 , a dirac fermion @xmath275 , and a complex scalar @xmath129 in the bulk specified by the background metric ( [ metric ] ) .

 here we adopt @xmath284 , and then the boundary mass parameter @xmath151 in eq . 
 ( [ eq : smass ] ) is different from that in ref .

 the massless vector multiplet has a flat wave function in the extra dimension . 
 on the other hand , the wave function for massless chiral multiplets involves a @xmath41-dependent contribution from the space - time metric , which induces a localization of the zero modes . the zero modes with masses @xmath119 and @xmath120 localize at @xmath121 and @xmath312 , respectively . 
 the case with @xmath114 corresponds to the conformal limit where the kinetic terms of the zero modes are independent of @xmath41 .

33,"the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the most important issues of present - day astronomy . 
 the currently favoured models suggest that large galaxies such as the milky way formed through the hierarchical accretion of a number of smaller objects .    one possible way to test this scenario is to focus on dwarf galaxies : 
 in fact , it is reasonable to expect that their assembly was considerably less complicated than that of the milky way , and easier to understand . 
 the nine dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellites of the milky way are ideal targets in this respect : theoretically , they might be the `` fossil '' remnants of the `` building blocks '' which ended up inside the milky way ; observationally , they can be studied in much greater detail than more distant objects . 
 for example , it has been possible to study their stellar populations , extracting informations about their star formation ( sf ) and chemical evolution histories ( see e.g. the review by mateo 1998 ) , which turned out to be quite varied . however , all of them contain a population of very old stars , and all of them exhibit low mean metallicities ( grebel & gallagher 2004 ) . 
 large observational programs ( such as dart , i.e. dwarf abundances and radial - velocities team ) are measuring , for the first time , the stellar metallicity distribution in dsph galaxies ( tolstoy 2004 ; koch 2006 ; battaglia 2006 ) . despite the low average metallicities ( consistent with previous estimates ) , out of about 2000 stars which were observed in four different galaxies ( carina , fornax , sculptor , and sextans ) , none of them turned out to have a metallicity lower than [ fe / h]=-3 , which is quite surprising ( helmi 2006 ) .    here 
 , we use numerical simulations of chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies in order to investigate whether this dearth of very metal poor stars ( vmpss , i.e. stars with @xmath0}\leq-3 $ ] ) is consistent with the simple hypothesis that the gas in the dwarf galaxies was completely self - enriched in metals ( i.e. that the gas metallicity when sf started in these galaxies was essentially 0 ) , and that the imf of these galaxies was always given by a salpeter power law extending from 0.1 to 100 @xmath1 . 
 we modified the public sph code gadget ( springel 2001 ; springel 2005 ) in order to include the treatment of gas cooling , sf , supernova ( sn ) and stellar wind feedback , and metal enrichment of the inter - stellar medium . 
 a complete description will be given in ripamonti 2006 . 
 here it is sufficient to say that the gas cooling rate was taken from sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) ( if @xmath2 ; otherwise it was assumed to be 0 ) , the sf recipe assumes a schmidt law ( see e.g. thacker & couchman 2000 ) , the stellar lifetimes are taken from the geneva evolutionary tracks ( e.g. schaller 1992 ) , and that sn energies and yields are from woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) . 
 our simulations were aimed at reproducing the chemical properties of the sculptor dsph ( hereafter , scl ) , rather than those of the full sample of helmi ( 2006 ) . 
 the reason for this choice is that the low metallicity tail of scl extends to slightly lower metallicities than those of the other three dsphs ( a fact which will strengthen our conclusions ) . 
 furthermore , the sf history of scl appears to have lasted only a few gyr , and after this initial period it appears to have stopped , as no stellar population younger than about 10 gyr has been detected : such a simple history should be relatively easy to reproduce . 
 the total mass of scl was quoted to amount to a few @xmath3 ( queloz 1995 ) , but more recent estimates ( battaglia 2006 ) have put it at a much higher value ( @xmath4 ) . here 
 we report the results of simulations where its total mass was assumed to be @xmath5 : such a value is low when compared to recent measurements , but this should have only a small effect on the metallicity distribution of the stars in the galaxy .    }

 central panel : total mass of stars , and mass of stars in metallicity ranges ( symbols as in the top panel ) . 
 bottom panel : maximum ( dotted ) , average ( solid ) , and median ( dashed ) of stellar metallicities . ]      at the beginning of our simulations we assume that all the baryons are in gaseous form , and that both the gas and dm follow a nfw profile ( navarro 1997 ) with concentration @xmath8 and virial radius @xmath9 ( approximately coincident with the present - day tidal radius of scl ) . 
 we place 20000 dm particles and 100000 gaseous particles within twice the virial radius . 
 since we assume that a mass @xmath10 is entirely enclosed within @xmath11 , the total mass included in each simulation is about @xmath12 , of which a fraction @xmath13 is in the dm component , and a fraction @xmath14 is in the baryonic component ( @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the cosmological density parameters of dm and baryons ; see spergel 2006 ) . 
 the initial velocities were assigned according to the recipe for a spherical halo described in hernquist ( 1993 ) , and the gas particles were assumed to be cold . 
 the main parameters of our simulations were related to sf and feedback . 
 they include the typical mass of stellar particles ( @xmath17 ) , the sf efficiency @xmath18 ( which was varied in the range @xmath19 ; see e.g. thacker & couchman 2000 ) , the typical energy of a sn explosion which is transferred to neighbouring gas particles  ( @xmath20  erg ) erg , the feedback completely stopped the sf after much less than one gyr , preventing the formation of more than a few @xmath21 of stars . 
 ] , and the fraction @xmath22 of the metals ejected in a sn explosion which is retained by the galaxy ( we tested @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; this second value is justified by the results of mac low & ferrara 1999 , which found that metals from the sn ejecta can escape from the galaxy far more easily than the rest of the gas ) . 
 and @xmath18 indicated in each panel . 
 the dots ( whose size is comparable to the error bars ) show the metallicity distribution of 496 stars in scl . the leftmost point ( at @xmath0}=-3.5 $ ] ) actually groups together all the vmpss . 
 values are normalized to the total number of stars . ] 
 we ran a grid of simulations with different combinations of the above parameters ; each one was run for just 1 gyr , because in all of them we found that the formation of very low metallicity stars had essentially stopped before that time ( see fig . 
 the mass of the stellar component was always much smaller ( typically , by a factor 3 - 10 ) than the stellar mass in scl , but sf in the simulated galaxy was still active , even if only for stars with @xmath0}\gtrsim-2.3 $ ] . 
 this fact must be kept into account when comparing the observed scl metallicity distribution with those produced by the simulations , because the average stellar metallicity from the simulations is still growing . in fig . 
 2 we show such a comparison in four typical cases . 
 it is apparent that the fraction of vmpss is always very high ; it is higher in models where a low value of @xmath22 and an high value of @xmath18 are assumed ( which is unsurprising because such assumptions correspond to a longer timescale for the metal enrichment of the gas ) . in all the cases 
 the fraction of vmpss is difficult to reconcile with the observations , even when a `` dilution '' by a factor 3 - 10 ( due to the future formation of a large number of stars ) is introduced . 
 furthermore , the models with @xmath23 , where this discrepancy is lower , suffer from another problem at the high metallicity end , since they produce an average metallicity which is too high , at least if @xmath25 .    in fig . 
 3 we try to limit the effects of the unknown sf after the first gyr of evolution by looking just at the metallicity distribution of stars with @xmath0}\leq-2.3 $ ] , because in such metallicity range sf is essentially complete by the time the simulations are stopped . here 
 the excess of vmpss appears less dramatic ; but this is mostly an artifact of the large error bars due to the low number ( 23 ) of observed stars in this metallicity range . 
 furthermore , the _ shape _ of the distributions appear to be different : the models fail to reproduce the observed increase in the number of stars at @xmath0}\gtrsim-2.5 $ ] , and predict a very large number of essentially metal - free stars ( when @xmath23 is assumed , most of the vmpss have @xmath0}\leq-4 $ ] ) . 
 and @xmath18 indicated in each panel . 
 dots with error bars show the metallicity distribution of stars in scl . 
 the two leftmost bins refer to stars with @xmath0}\leq-4 $ ] , and with @xmath26}\leq-3.5 $ ] . 
 all the values are normalized to the number of stars with @xmath27/h\leq-2.3 $ ] . ] 
 the metallicity distribution obtained in our simulations is quite different from the predictions of lanfranchi & matteucci ( 2004 ) , as they predict a quite sharp drop at low metallicity ( @xmath28}\lesssim-2.5 $ ] ) , in agreement with observations ( however , there is significant disagreement at @xmath0}\gtrsim-1.5 $ ] ) . 
 this is probably due to their assumptions about the `` infall '' history of gas inside the galaxy ( which implies a very low sf rate at early times , when the vmpss should form ) , and about the complete mixing of gas ( so that there is no spread in the age - metallicity relation ) . 
 instead , we have a large spread ( of the order of 1 dex ) in the metallicities of stars which form after the very early stages of our simulations ; furthermore , we do not need to assume an infall history for the gas , even if it can be argued that our initial conditions are not completely realistic because of the assumption that no star ever formed before the halo density profile reached a nfw shape . 
 our simulations indicate that the dearth of observed vmpss in dsphs is problematic . apart from the hypothesis that observations are biased in some unidentified way against the detection of vmpss 
 , possible solutions might involve a pre - enrichment of the gas up to the @xmath0}\sim-3 $ ] level ( see e.g. helmi 2006 ) , or a difference between the present and the primordial ( metal - free ) imf , such as a suppression of the sf rate of stars below @xmath29 in environments of very low metallicity ( see e.g. omukai 2005 ) .

34,"the dynamical density  matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite and the closely related correction  vector dmrg  @xcite have been widely used in the last decade to compute the dynamical correlation functions and spectral functions of low - dimensional strongly correlated quantum systems . 
 @xcite although more powerful dmrg approaches have been developed recently ,  @xcite dynamical dmrg ( ddmrg ) often remains the method of choice because it offers two practical advantages over the other approaches : it is simpler and it can be easily parallelized . 
 for instance , it has been recently shown that ddmrg allows us to investigate features with small spectral weights such as power - law pseudo - gaps in luttinger liquids . 
 @xcite the main drawback of ddmrg is that it always yields the convolution of the desired spectrum with a lorentzian distribution of finite width . 
 therefore , the true spectrum can only be obtained through a deconvolution of the ddmrg spectrum . 
 ( in principle , there are some methods to get around this problem  @xcite but they are rarely used in practice . )    deconvolution is a typical ill - conditioned inverse problem , however . 
 @xcite a direct solution of the deconvolution equation usually yields a very noisy and thus useless spectrum . nevertheless , various regularization methods have been successfully used to deconvolve ddmrg spectra for one - dimensional systems and quantum impurity problems . 
 @xcite astonishingly , some of these deconvolution methods even allow us to bypass the finite - size scaling analysis and to obtain the piecewise smooth spectrum of an infinite systems directly from a broadened finite - system ddmrg spectrum . 
 unfortunately , regularization also smooths out the sharp features of the true spectrum . 
 this is a serious issue as the spectra of one - dimensional systems and quantum impurities often exhibit very interesting ( power - law ) singularities .    in this paper 
 we present a method , which allows us to determine sharp spectral features in the thermodynamic limit starting from a broadened finite - system ddmrg spectrum . for this purpose 
 we consider the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit and the deconvolution for the lorentzian kernel to be a single blind deconvolution ,  @xcite i.e.  an inverse problem with an unknown kernel including both the lorentzian broadening and the finite - size effects . the key idea to preserve sharp spectral features in a piecewise smooth spectrum is to impose a minimal distance @xmath0 between extrema of the deconvolved spectrum . to illustrate our method we investigate the single - particle density of states ( dos ) of one - dimensional paramagnetic mott insulators represented by the half - filled hubbard model . 
 @xcite we confirm that this dos has the step - like onset predicted by field - theoretical studies  @xcite at least at weak to intermediate coupling up to @xmath1 . 
 the hubbard model  @xcite with on - site interaction @xmath2 and nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath3 is a basic lattice model for the physics of strongly interacting electrons , in particular the mott metal - insulator transition . 
 @xcite at half filling ( i.e. , the number of electrons equals the number of sites @xmath4 ) the ground state is a mott insulator for strong interaction @xmath5 , while it is a fermi gas in the non - interacting limit @xmath6 . 
 the hamiltonian of the hubbard model is defined by @xmath7 where the operator @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath10 on the site @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . 
 the first sum runs over all pairs @xmath14 of nearest - neighbor sites while the other two sums run over all sites @xmath15 . 
 here we will only consider half - filled systems and thus set the chemical potential @xmath16 to have electron - hole - symmetric spectra and a fermi energy @xmath17 . 
 the bulk single - particle dos @xmath18 can be measured experimentally using photoemission spectroscopy or scanning tunneling spectroscopy . 
 theoretically , it can be defined as the average of the local dos @xmath19 where the sum runs over both spins and all sites @xmath15 in the lattice , while @xmath20 is the local single - particle dos at site @xmath15 for spin @xmath10 and can be calculated using @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 . here 
 @xmath25 denotes the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath26 and @xmath27 their eigenenergies in the fock space . 
 the ground state for the chosen number of particles corresponds to @xmath28 . the total spectral weight is @xmath29 we will consider only lattice geometry for which the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is invariant under the electron - hole transformation @xmath30 . 
 therefore , for half filling the density of states is symmetric , @xmath31 . if the system is translation invariant , the bulk dos and the local dos are identical . for dmrg simulations , however , open boundary conditions are preferred to periodic boundary conditions . in this case 
 , the bulk dos can be identified with the local dos on one of the two equivalent middle sites of the system , i.e.  as far as possible from the system boundaries . 
 inverse problems such as ( blind ) deconvolutions  @xcite occur in many scientific fields and are among the most challenging numerical computations . 
 experimental measurements and computer simulations often yield approximations of the true quantities which are measured or computed , respectively . 
 it is often assumed that the deviations from exact results can be modelled by a convolution with a smoothing function and an additive noise due to the finite accuracy and resolution of the measurement or simulation process . 
 a typical example of a blind deconvolution is the reconstruction of an original signal from a degraded copy using incomplete information about the degradation process . 
 @xcite here we want to compute sharp spectral features in the piecewise smooth spectrum of an infinite system from a broadened finite - system spectrum calculated with ddmrg . in this section 
 we first show that this task can be formulated as a blind deconvolution problem , then present an algorithm for solving it . 
 let @xmath32 be a spectrum of a finite lattice model with @xmath4 sites . 
 this spectrum is a dirac - comb ( a finite sum of dirac - peaks ) @xmath33 where the sum runs over all hamiltonian eigenstates @xmath25 which contributes to the spectrum , i.e.  with a nonzero spectral weight @xmath34 . here 
 @xmath35 denotes the corresponding excitation energies . 
 this spectrum can be broadened with a lorentzian distribution of width @xmath36 @xmath37 to obtain a smooth spectral function @xmath38 with the ddmrg method we can calculate this spectrum for a discrete set of excitation energies @xmath39 . as numerical calculations are always affected by errors , ddmrg actually yields values @xmath40 which are related to the true spectral function by @xmath41 for @xmath42 , where @xmath43 represents the unknown errors . 
 ( it should be noted that ddmrg errors @xmath43 include significant systematic contributions , for instance due to the variational nature of the procedure . 
 @xcite ) in principle , one could determine the true spectrum , i.e. , the excitation energies @xmath35 and the corresponding weights @xmath44 , through this system of equations . in practice 
 , however , this is an ill - conditioned problem except for simple discrete spectra . 
 moreover , we are not interested in resolving the discrete peaks of small systems but in calculating the piecewise smooth spectra of macroscopic systems . 
 the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit is given by @xmath45 note that , generally , the order of the two limits can not be exchanged . 
 typically , the spectral function @xmath46 is piecewise smooth , i.e. , it exhibits one or more continua as well as isolated sharp features such as steps , power - law singularities or cusps . in principle 
 , one should carry out several ddmrg simulations with varying system size @xmath4 and broadening @xmath36 and then extrapolate the numerical data to obtain @xmath46 . in most cases , 
 a simultaneous extrapolation for @xmath47 and @xmath48 is possible  @xcite using a constant value of @xmath49 . 
 nevertheless , the computational cost of ddmrg simulations increases very rapidly with smaller @xmath36 and the overall cost of this approach is prohibitive for a full spectrum . 
 indeed , this approach has been mostly used to study isolated spectral features in the thermodynamic limit such as power - law singularities and steps . 
 @xcite    as all operations used to define @xmath46 from @xmath50 are linear , the broadened spectrum of the finite system can also be written explicitly as a function of the infinite system spectrum @xmath51 the kernel @xmath52 includes both the finite - size effects and the lorentzian smoothing . 
 its form is not known but it is clear that we must recover a pure lorentzian smoothing in the thermodynamic limit @xmath53 combining eqs . 
 ( [ eq : deconv ] ) and  ( [ eq : spec - inf ] ) we obtain a system of equations @xmath54 for @xmath55 , relating the ddmrg data set @xmath56 to the infinite system spectrum @xmath46 . 
 determining @xmath46 from these equations is a so - called inverse problem . 
 @xcite this kind of problem is also called blind deconvolution since our knowledge of the kernel is incomplete . 
 [ strictly speaking , it is not a deconvolution because eq . 
 ( [ eq : inverse - problem ] ) is not a convolution . 
 however , as the kernel approaches the form @xmath57 in the thermodynamic limit , we will use the terminology of deconvolution problems . ] 
 it should be obvious that this is an ill - posed problem . 
 first , the errors @xmath43 and the kernel @xmath52 are not known . 
 second , the problem is sorely underdetermined as we try to reconstruct the function of a continuous variable from a finite number @xmath58 of data points . 
 finally , a convolution with a lorentzian is a smoothing operation and thus the corresponding deconvolution is an extremely ill - conditioned inverse problem : the solution will be extremely sensitive to small changes or errors in the input . 
 various deconvolution methods have been used successfully to deduce piecewise smooth spectra from the broadened finite - system spectra calculated with ddmrg . 
 they include , direct inversion at low resolution ,  @xcite linear regularization methods ,  @xcite fourier transform with low - pass filtering ,  @xcite nonlinear regularization methods such as the maximum entropy method ,  @xcite parametrization with piecewise polynomial functions ,  @xcite and a deconvolution ansatz for the self energy . 
 @xcite however , this task has not been viewed as a blind deconvolution so far . 
 instead , it has been considered as the deconvolution of a perfectly known kernel . 
 the need for regularization or filtering techniques has been viewed as the consequence ill - conditioning and under - determination of the problem  ( [ eq : inverse - problem ] ) with a lorentzian kernel . 
 all of these methods offer some advantages for particular spectral forms . however , their common drawback is that they are ill - suited for sharp spectral features , such as steps or power - law singularities , within or at the edge of a continuum . 
 either the regularization procedure smooths out true sharp features excessively or it allows the occurrence of deconvolution artifacts ( artificial sharp structures , rapid oscillations or negative spectral weight ) , especially in the vicinity of the true spectrum singularities . 
 naturally , better results can be obtained if we can use _ a priori _ knowledge about the properties of the spectrum  @xcite but , in practice , this is a rare occurrence . 
 therefore , we need a better method for solving the inverse problem  ( [ eq : inverse - problem ] ) which allows us to determine isolated sharp spectral features accurately while preserving the positivity and the piecewise smoothness of @xmath46 
 .    let the ddmrg data ( [ eq : dmrg - data ] ) be evenly distributed in the energy interval @xmath59 $ ] . 
 the difference between two consecutive energies is @xmath60 . 
 additionally , consider a set of equidistant energies @xmath61 in the interval @xmath62 \subset [ \epsilon_a,\epsilon_b]$ ] . 
 the distance between these energies is @xmath63 . as we will always use @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 . 
 ( typical values are @xmath66 and @xmath67 . ) as in a least - square approach we define a cost function @xmath68 as the sum of the squares of the differences between the ddmrg data and an approximate representation parametrized by a discrete set of variables @xmath69 @xmath70 the absolute minimum of @xmath68 is zero and the corresponding parameters @xmath71 are determined by a linear system of @xmath58 equations @xmath72 using this equation system to determine the parameters @xmath71 would be an unconstrained least - square fit .    in the limit @xmath73 ( followed by @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) 
 this equation system becomes equivalent to the inverse problem  ( [ eq : inverse - problem ] ) with vanishing errors @xmath76 . 
 thus the absolute minimum of @xmath68 yields the spectrum @xmath46 through @xmath77    if we substitute a lorentz kernel @xmath78 for the unknown kernel , @xmath79 in  ( [ eq : linear - system ] ) , we recover the finite - system deconvolution problem defined by equations  ( [ eq : spec - finite ] ) and  ( [ eq : deconv ] ) for vanishing errors @xmath43 . 
 thus the absolute minimum of the cost function corresponds to the discrete finite - system spectrum @xmath32 through @xmath80 if @xmath81 and @xmath82 otherwise . 
 physically , the solution of the deconvolution problem is unique for vanishing errors @xmath43 and thus the cost function should have a unique absolute minimum . from a mathematical point of view , however , the equation system  ( [ eq : linear - system ] ) could have no solution or infinitely many solutions . then any small error @xmath43 can generate wildly different ( and mostly unphysical ) solutions .    therefore , as  ( [ eq : kernel - limit ] ) holds in the thermodynamic limit , it is possible and preferable to obtain a reasonable approximation of the infinite - system spectrum @xmath46 from the minimization of the cost function  ( [ eq : cost - function ] ) with a lorentz kernel under the constraint that the spectral function @xmath46 is physically allowed . 
 for instance , @xmath46 should be positive semidefinite and piecewise smooth . 
 generally , this solution does not correspond to the absolute minimum or even a local minimum of @xmath68 . 
 indeed , the solution of the inverse problem  ( [ eq : inverse - problem ] ) corresponds to the value @xmath83 if we assume that the relation  ( [ eq : solution ] ) holds . 
 of course , it could be possible to lower the cost function with other configurations @xmath84 but in that case the relation  ( [ eq : solution ] ) would no longer hold . 
 note that , this idea has been implicitly assumed in all previous deconvolution schemes of ddmrg data aiming at piecewise smooth spectra so far . 
 however , in these approaches the agreement between solution @xmath84 and numerical data @xmath85 in eq . 
 ( [ eq : linear - system ] ) with a lorentzian kernel is considered essential while the regularization of the solution and the errors @xmath43 are seen as perturbations which should deteriorate the agreement as little as possible .    yet a blind deconvolution requires equal balancing of the agreement between solution and numerical data and of the smoothness and stability of the solution . 
 @xcite hence we must take a different point of view : the lorentzian kernel  ( [ eq : kernel - limit ] ) is only an approximation of the true kernel @xmath52 and the physical constraints on the deconvolved spectrum @xmath46 are essential in the minimization of the cost function . thus we accept significant deviations of @xmath84 from the conditions  ( [ eq : linear - system ] ) yielding the absolute minimum of the cost function , or , equivalently , we assume that the errors @xmath43 can be substantial .      therefore , the blind deconvolution problem can be formulated as a least - square optimization under non - linear constraints . 
 we want to minimize the cost function  ( [ eq : cost - function ] ) with the lorentz kernel under the constraints that the spectrum @xmath46 has the following properties :    1 . 
 finite band width , i.e @xmath86 for all @xmath87 and all @xmath88 for some finite @xmath89 , 2 . 
 positive semi - definite , @xmath90 , and 3 . 
 piecewise smooth . 
 the first two conditions are easily expressed for the parameters @xmath91 . 
 the somewhat fuzzy concept of a piecewise smooth spectrum must now be formulated more precisely . in principle 
 , we wish that @xmath46 is piecewise continuous and that the distance between discontinuities is larger than a minimal energy difference @xmath0 . 
 as we must work with a finite number @xmath92 of points @xmath93 , we only have a discrete representation of @xmath46 and we have to formulate a `` continuity '' condition for the discrete set of variables as well . 
 therefore , we require that the distance between two significant extrema is larger than a parameter @xmath94 
 . two neighboring extrema at energy @xmath95 and @xmath96 are significant if there relative height difference is larger than a parameter @xmath97 , @xmath98 this condition can easily be formulated for the parameters @xmath91 . 
 the minimal extremum distance @xmath0 must be chosen carefully . 
 it should be smaller than the distance between actual singularities in the spectrum @xmath46 but a too small value allows many artificial peaks in a deconvolved spectrum . in practice , we have found that we can obtain reasonable solutions to the blind deconvolution problem which look piecewise smooth using @xmath99 . in all examples discussed in this paper 
 every local extremum is considered to be significant ( i.e. , we have used the precision of floating - point arithmetic @xmath100 ) . 
 the cost function is minimized iteratively . 
 iterations are repeated until the procedure converges . 
 each iteration consists in two steps . in the first step 
 the cost function @xmath101 is minimized with respect to each variable @xmath102 successively . 
 this minimization under constraint does not present any difficulty as @xmath101 is a second - order polynomial in each variable @xmath103 . in the second step , we first find the positions @xmath104 of all significant extrema pairs in @xmath105 which are separated by less than a distance @xmath0 
 . then we interpolate the data @xmath105 linearly from @xmath106 to @xmath107 to smooth out the spectrum around the extrema . in doing 
 so we take care to preserve the total spectral weight @xmath108 the search for extrema and their smoothing is repeated until there is no more close significant extrema in @xmath109 . 
 then we start the next iteration . by design the first step results in a decrease of @xmath101 . 
 the second step nearly always results in an increase of @xmath101 . without the second step , however , we would perform an under - determined ( @xmath110 ) deconvolution devoid of any regularization mechanism and thus obtain a completely useless result . 
 typically , we observe a rapid and monotonic decrease of @xmath101 in the initial iterations followed by a saturation or oscillations in further iterations . 
 therefore , we monitor the changes in the parameters @xmath103 and the normalized cost function @xmath111 to determine converged configurations @xmath71 . 
 convergence requires typically @xmath112 to @xmath113 iterations depending on the quality of the ddmrg data and the complexity of the spectrum . 
 finally , the solution @xmath91 can be smoothened using a narrow lorentzian distribution to obtain a continuous function @xmath114 with @xmath115 . 
 alternatively , we can use a gaussian distribution  @xcite of width @xmath116 . 
 the second approach yields sharper ( real or artificial ) features because the tail of a gaussian distribution decreases faster than that of the lorentz distribution . as our minimization problem possesses many local minima , the final results @xmath71 depend somewhat on the criteria for convergence . however , if the final smoothening function is broad enough , the differences are canceled out . 
 if the ddmrg data  ( [ eq : dmrg - data ] ) are not evenly distributed in the interval @xmath59 $ ] or if they already exhibit numerous close extrema , it is useful to regularize them before starting the deconvolution iterations using an interpolation and the smoothening procedure described above . 
 the computational effort required by this procedure is negligible compared to the computational cost of the ddmrg simulations yielding the original data . 
 ( our code in the programming language c contains less than 400 lines of instructions and the deconvolution of one spectrum takes less than 30 minutes on a single cpu . ) 
 therefore , we have not bothered to optimize the algorithm . 
 nevertheless , it should be implemented in such a way that it only requires @xmath117 operations rather than the @xmath118 operations of a straightforward implementation . 
 the method described here can be generalized in several ways . 
 for instance , it is possible to use a variable spacing @xmath119 of the ddmrg data points , such as a finer mesh close to sharp spectrum features . 
 however , this does not seem to improve the results in practice because the broadening parameter @xmath36 , not @xmath119 , is the limiting scale . 
 a generalization to variable @xmath36 and @xmath119 , as proposed in ref .   for quantum impurity problems , should also be possible but we have not tested it yet . to introduce information about the variation of the spectrum with @xmath36 one could combine ddmrg data obtained for different values of @xmath36 by defining an overall cost function as the sum of the cost functions for each @xmath36 . 
 these generalizations will be tested in future works . 
 as an illustration of our deconvolution procedure we discuss its application to the dos of one - dimensional paramagnetic mott insulators . 
 the nature of mott insulators is a long - standing open problem in the theory of strongly correlated quantum systems . 
 @xcite in a paramagnetic mott insulator quantum fluctuations or frustration of the antiferromagnetic spin exchange coupling prevents the formation of a long - range magnetic order . 
 experimentally , non - magnetic mott insulators have been found in layered organic insulators  @xcite as well as in quasi - one - dimensional cuprate chains  @xcite and ladders  @xcite . despite decades of extensive research the properties of mott insulators , in particular their single - particle dos , are still poorly understood and thus actively investigated . 
 the half - filled hubbard model  @xcite with repulsive on - site interaction @xmath2 is a basic lattice model for describing mott insulators and the mott metal - insulator transition . 
 here we consider the case of the one - dimensional hubbard model , which is exactly solvable by bethe ansatz . 
 @xcite at half- filling it describes a paramagnetic mott insulator with a charge gap ( mott - hubbard gap ) @xmath120 for @xmath121 . 
 however , the dos can not be calculated directly from the bethe ansatz . 
 all ddmrg spectra used here have been calculated with a variable number of density - matrix eigenstates kept ( up to 512 ) to reach a discarded weight lower than @xmath122 and to check dmrg truncation errors . 
 typically , convergence was reached after three sweeps for each frequency interval of size @xmath36 . 
 the ddmrg method is presented in detail in ref .  . 
 for @xmath6 the exact dos of the tight - binding chain in the thermodynamic limit is @xmath123 for @xmath124 while @xmath125 vanishes for larger @xmath126 . for finite coupling @xmath127 
 the spectrum consists in two symmetric hubbard bands separated by the gap @xmath128 . 
 low - order strong - coupling perturbation theory  @xcite predicts a square - root divergence at the dos threshold for @xmath129 , namely @xmath130 for @xmath131 and @xmath132 otherwise with @xmath133 . because of this strong - coupling result and the result of the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation it has often been assumed that the dos of one - dimensional mott insulators exhibits a square - root divergence at the spectrum onset @xmath134 like in a one - dimensional band insulator . 
 indeed , in the unrestricted hf approximation the one - dimensional half - filled hubbard model is an antiferromagnetic mott insulator for @xmath121 . 
 its dos is given by @xmath135 for @xmath136 and vanishes otherwise . here 
 @xmath137 is the hf gap . for @xmath6 , @xmath138 and 
 this dos reduces to the dos of the tight - biding chain  ( [ eq : dos - tb ] ) . for @xmath139 , @xmath140 and the hf dos shows a square - root divergence at the onset of the spectrum . 
 however , in the weak - coupling limit @xmath141 a field - theoretical analysis  @xcite predicts that the dos of one - dimensional mott insulators is constant above the threshold energy @xmath142 , @xmath143 at least for @xmath144 . 
 thus there is a discrepancy between the field - theoretical and strong - coupling predictions for the behavior of @xmath18 just above the threshold energy @xmath142 .

 the ddmrg spectrum has been calculated in the middle of an open chain with @xmath151 sites using a broadening @xmath146 , which is just broad enough to hide its discreteness . 
 we see that the square - root divergences at @xmath152 have been smoothed into two broad peaks and that there is substantial spectral weight at energies @xmath153 . 
 the deconvolved dos has been determined from these same ddmrg data using a minimal extremum distance @xmath154 and a final gaussian broadening with @xmath155 . 
 we see now that the singularities at @xmath152 are clearly visible as sharp peaks and that there is not any spectral weight at @xmath153 . 
 overall the deconvolved dos is in excellent agreement with the exact spectrum in the thermodynamic limit  ( [ eq : dos - tb ] ) . in particular 
 , we do not observe any unphysical artefact such as negative spectral weight . 
 however , in fig .  [ fig : tb](a ) we observe two shoulders in the deconvolved dos at energies @xmath156 , which are not present in the exact solution  ( [ eq : dos - tb ] ) . 
 an enlarged view close to the singularity at @xmath157 is shown in fig .  [

 we also show deconvolved spectra @xmath109 for two different values of the normalized cost function @xmath158 . clearly , they reproduce the square - root divergence at @xmath157 much better than the original ddmrg data . 
 the overall divergent behavior is visible on a broader energy scale for the smaller value of @xmath158 but we see that the reduction of the cost function is also accompanied by stronger oscillations around the exact result . 
 these oscillations correspond to the shoulder seen in fig . 
 [ fig : tb](a ) . 
 the occurrence of artificial shoulder - like structures is the main drawback of our deconvolution procedure . 
 any deconvolution method magnifies the noise ( numerical errors ) which is present in the original data . 
 this the main issue that existing methods try to solve in different ways . 
 @xcite we have systematically tested our deconvolution procedure using exact results for non - interacting systems and purposely adding random numerical errors . 
 we have found that by preventing the formation of local maxima in the deconvolved spectrum our procedure allows us to control the noise magnification only partially . 
 unfortunately , it can not handle extrema ( @xmath159 oscillations ) in the spectrum derivative . 
 thus the magnified noise shows up as shoulder - like structures ( but not as local maxima , discontinuities , or sharp angles ) on an energy scale @xmath0 and gives a rough appearance to some deconvoled spectra presented here . in principle , we should be able to correct this deficiency with a higher - order interpolation procedure in the smoothening step or with a smoothening of the derivative of @xmath46 ( i.e. , the finite differences between the parameters @xmath103 ) . 
 however , we have not yet succeeded in developing a practical algorithm based on these ideas .

 the ddmrg spectrum has been computed  @xcite in the middle of an open chain with @xmath151 sites and a broadening @xmath146 . 
 the deconvolved spectrum has been obtained from these ddmrg data using a minimal extremum distance @xmath165 and a final gaussian broadening @xmath166 . 
 the effects of the broadening are clearly visible in the ddmrg data . 
 for instance , although one can recognize the opening of the mott - hubbard gap @xmath128 , spectral weight is clearly visible inside the gap . 
 a point - wise analysis  @xcite of the scaling for @xmath47 with @xmath167 is required to confirm that the spectral weight jumps from @xmath168 to a finite value at the onset @xmath169 and that the gap width agrees with the exact results @xmath170 calculated with the bethe ansatz . 
 @xcite however , the behavior for @xmath171 remains uncertain because of the relatively large broadening used in the ddmrg calculation . on the contrary 
 the deconvolved dos clearly shows a gap with the step - like onset  ( [ eq : dos - ft ] ) predicted by field theory  @xcite at the position @xmath172 given by the bethe ansatz solution . 
 we obtain similarly unambiguous results for @xmath127 up to @xmath173 ( see below ) . 
 therefore , our numerical investigation confirms the field - theoretical prediction  @xcite for the onset of the dos in one - dimensional mott insulators . 
 the superiority of the deconvolved spectrum over the original ddmrg data is even more obvious in fig . 
 [ fig : onedim4](b ) which shows an enlarged view of the dos around @xmath172 . in this figure 
 we also show the result of a deconvolution of the ddmrg data with a standard linear regularization method  @xcite . 
 ( note that this method yields negative spectral weights for some energies @xmath174 but we show the positive parts only . ) 
 we see that the result of the deconvolution procedure proposed in this work is much superior to that of the standard one , which is too blurred to allow us to determine the true form of the dos at the onset @xmath172 . 
 in addition , fig . 
 [ fig : onedim4](b ) shows the result of our deconvolution procedure for a minimal extremum distance @xmath175 which is deliberately too small . in that case , 
 artificial oscillations on energy scales @xmath176 are clearly visible in the deconvolved spectrum .

 , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in the strong - coupling limit @xmath180 our results are less conclusive . 
 for instance , we show the ddmrg and deconvolved upper hubbard and for a very strong coupling @xmath177 in fig . 
 [ fig : onedim40 ] . 
 the ddmrg spectrum has been calculated in the middle of an open chain with @xmath181 sites using a broadening @xmath178 . 
 the deconvolved spectrum has been obtained from these ddmrg data using a minimal extremum distance @xmath182 and a final a gaussian broadening @xmath179 . 
 two broad peaks are clearly visible at energies @xmath183 as predicted for the strong - coupling limit . 
 however , the widths and heights of these peaks after deconvolution are not compatible with the square - root divergences  ( [ eq : dos - scpt ] ) predicted by the low - order strong - coupling expansion . 
 actually , higher - order corrections indicate  @xcite that some spectral weight is present below the peak at @xmath184 on a scale set by the effective spin exchange coupling @xmath185 . 
 this width is compatible with our deconvolved spectra for @xmath186 . 
 thus our numerical results agree at least qualitatively with strong - coupling perturbation theory and suggest that the square - root divergences in the dos  ( [ eq : dos - scpt ] ) is an artifact of a truncated strong - coupling expansion . 
 nevertheless , for strong coupling such as @xmath177 we are not able to determine the shape of the dos at the onset @xmath172 . in particular 
 , it is not clear if the field - theoretical prediction  ( [ eq : dos - ft ] ) is still valid . indeed , 
 if the distance @xmath187 between onset at @xmath169 and peak at @xmath188 becomes smaller than the minimal extremum distance @xmath0 , we can no longer distinguish both structures in the deconvolved spectrum . in practice , 
 the distance @xmath0 must be comparable to the broadening @xmath36 of the ddmrg data to obtain piecewise smooth spectra . 
 therefore , although we can reduce the broadening of isolated spectral structures by several orders of magnitude , we can not resolve distinct spectral features on a scale lower than the original broadening of the ddmrg data . 
 this is a limitation of our deconvolution method that one has to keep in mind .

 the result for @xmath177 is shifted to the left by @xmath193 . 
 , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    finally , fig . 
 [ fig : onedim ] recapitulates the evolution of the dos as a function of the interaction strength @xmath5 . as the spectrum is symmetric @xmath194 , 
 we show only the deconvolved spectra for positive energies ( i.e. , the upper hubbard band ) . at @xmath6 
 the spectrum consists in a single band with two clearly visible square - root singularities at the band edges @xmath195 . for weak coupling @xmath127 
 the band splits into two symmetric hubbard bands separated by a gap @xmath128 , which agrees perfectly with the charge gap calculated from the bethe ansatz solution . at the dos onsets 
 @xmath196 the spectrum exhibits the step - like behavior  ( [ eq : dos - ft ] ) predicted by field theory . 
 @xcite there is an apparent plateau between the onset and a strong first peak , which evolves from the square - root singularities at @xmath195 for @xmath6 . 
 additionally , we observe substantial spectral weight and a small second peak at higher excitation energy . 
 however , for weak enough @xmath127 most of the spectral weight lies between the spectrum onset and the first peak .    as @xmath127 increases ( compare the spectra for @xmath160 and @xmath1 in fig . 
 [ fig : onedim ] ) , the spectrum and all its features shift to higher excitation energy and the spectral weight becomes more concentrated between the visible peaks . in addition , we note that the separation between onset energy @xmath142 and the strong first peak becomes systematically smaller until it is no longer resolvable with our method , the peak separation increases monotonically from about @xmath197 for @xmath198 to approximately @xmath199 for @xmath200 , and the strength of both peaks become more equal .    comparing the dos with the momentum - resolved spectral function and the bethe ansatz dispersion ( see figs . 4 and 5 in ref .  ) 
 we note that the strong first peak corresponds to the edge of the spinon branch at momentum @xmath201 , the weak second peak corresponds to the edge of the holon branch at @xmath202 , and the upper edge of the dos spectrum coincide with the edge of the single spinon - holon continuum . 
 finally , we do not observe any spectral weight outside the first lower and upper hubbard bands and these two bands account for the full spectral weight  ( [ eq : sum ] ) . 
 thus we conclude that higher - energy hubbard bands do not carry any spectral weight in the bulk single - particle dos . 
 we have presented a blind deconvolution procedure which allows us to obtain piecewise smooth spectral functions for infinite - size systems from the ddmrg spectra of finite systems . 
 it involves a trade - off between the agreement of the deconvolved spectrum to the original ddmrg data and the piecewise smoothness and positivity of spectral functions . in practice 
 , the method reduces to a least - square optimization under non - linear constraints which enforce the positivity and piecewise smoothness . 
 we have tested this deconvolution method on many spectra which are known exactly in the thermodynamic limit , such as the single - particle density of states and the optical conductivity of correlated one - dimensional insulators . 
 @xcite we have found that our method works well for several kinds of singularities ( e.g.  power - law band edges , steps , excitonic peaks ) in piecewise smooth spectra . in particular , it allows us to reduce the broadening by orders of magnitude and even to substitute the lorentzian broadening by a gaussian one . 
 its main drawback is the frequent appearance of artificial shoulder - like structures on energy scales @xmath203 . 
 we have demonstrated the deconvolution procedure on the single - particle dos in the one - dimensional hubbard model at half filling . 
 our results show that the dos has a step - like shape but no square - root singularity at the spectrum onset in agreement with a field - theoretical prediction for one - dimensional paramagnetic mott insulators . 
 @xcite in addition , the deconvolution procedure has allowed us to detail the evolution of the dos from the non - interacting limit @xmath6 to the strong - coupling limit @xmath180 .

35,"non - hermitian hamiltonians are often employed to describe the open systems due to their features of complex - valued energy and non - preserved particle probability . 
 recent observations show that a large families of non - hermitian hamiltonians can have all eigenvalues real , if the loss and gain are set in a balanced manner , being invariant under the combination of the parity ( @xmath1 ) and the time - reversal ( @xmath2 ) symmetry . a parity - time ( @xmath3 ) symmetric non - hermitian quantum theory has been well developed as the complex extension of conventional quantum mechanics @xcite . 
 although the condition of the @xmath3 symmetry for a complete real spectrum is weaker @xcite , it still implies the underlying mechanism can be based on the balance of the loss and gain . 
 however , such an intuitive consideration of the balance needs to be investigated precisely . 
 the concept of the balance should not be simply understood as the conjugate relation of two non - hermitian subsystems arising from the @xmath3 symmetry . 
 it can not provide physical explanation to the following features about exceptional point : ( i ) the @xmath3 symmetry of the system can not guarantee the balance of the loss and the gain , or the reality of the energy levels . 
 ( ii ) the spontaneous symmetry broken states always appear in pairs . 
 furthermore , this consideration is also related to the precise physical significance of the complex potential and non - hermitian coupling , which are basic elements for a discrete non - hermitian system . on the other hand , 
 the purpose of this investigation is not only for the fundamental physics , but also for the application in practice due to the formal equivalence between the quantum schrdinger equation and the optical wave equation @xcite . 
 furthermore , the @xmath3 symmetry breaking has been observed in experiments @xcite .    in this paper 
 , we investigate semi - infinite non - hermitian system without @xmath0 symmetry . based on this , we try to clarify the concept of balance in the non - hermitian discrete system in the framework of the quantum mechanics rather than a phenomenological description . 
 we show an entirely real spectrum and study the exceptional point of a semi - infinite non - hermitian system from the dynamical point of view . 
 we show that the wave function within the lead becomes a unidirectional plane wave at the exceptional point . 
 this universal dynamical behavior is demonstrated as the self - sustained emission and reflectionless absorption of wave packets by two typical non - hermitian clusters containing the complex on - site potential and non - hermitian hopping amplitude . 
 this paper is organized as follows . in section [ semi - infinite system ] 
 we analyze the classification of possible solutions and solve two examples to illustrate our main idea . 
 section [ relation with pt ]  presents the connection between the semi - infinite systems and @xmath3-symmetric systems . 
 section [ wavepacket ] is devoted to the numerical simulation of the wave packet dynamics to demonstrate the phenomena of the persistent emission and reflectionless absorption . 
 section [ sec_summary ] is the summary and discussion . 
 the discrete non - hermitian model , with the non - hermiticity arising from the on - site complex potentials as well as the non - hermitian hopping amplitude , is a nice testing ground to study the basic features of the non - hermitian system not only because of its analytical and numerical tractability but also the experimental accessibility . in recent years , 
 fundamental aspects of non - hermitian continuum systems are studies by using discretization znojil , as well as the studies on quantum square wells @xcite . on the other hand , 
 non - hermitian quantum models are also investigated , such as tight - binding systems @xcite , spin systems @xcite , and strongly correlated systems @xcite . besides the fundamental features of discrete @xmath3-symmetric quantum systems , theoretical research on the quantum dynamics and scattering behaviors in discrete non - hermitian networks are investigated in a series of papers @xcite . in experiment , light transport in large - scale temporal lattices 
 is studied in @xmath4-symmetric fiber networks , it is also demonstrated that the @xmath3-symmetric network can act as a unidirectional invisible media @xcite . 
 although many surprising features and possible applications of @xmath3-symmetric are revealed , they are mostly based on the finite systems . in this paper 
 , we intend to study the infinite system .      here 
 we consider a semi - infinite lead coupled to a non - hermitian finite cluster . 
 the hamiltonian is written as @xmath5it is noted that @xmath6  is non - hermitian , possessing the complex - valued eigen energy , while @xmath7  is hermitian , having complete spectrum @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the eigen state @xmath10 .  to investigate the role of the lead in the non - hermitian @xmath11 , we will consider the whole solution of the hamiltonian @xmath12 and analyze its properties . 
 the eigen state can be expressed as @xmath13 . 
 the explicit form of the wave function @xmath14 depends on the structure of @xmath6 . generally speaking 
 , the solution of @xmath15 can not be obtained exactly even the explicit form of @xmath6  is given . however , within the lead the wave function is always in the form @xmath16due to the semi - infinite boundary condition . 
 the schrdinger equation has the explicit form@xmath17 \right ) &   \notag\end{aligned}\]]within all the regions . 
 the solutions of @xmath18 and @xmath15 depend on the structure of the system @xmath6 . 
 nevertheless , the exclusive geometry of the lead will give some clues to the characteristics of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . 
 in the framework of bethe ansatz method , all possible solutions within the lead  can be classified into three types :    \(1 ) scattering state wave , the wave function and energy are in the form @xmath19 
 \(2 ) monotonic damping wave , the wave function and energy are in the form@xmath20    \(3 ) oscillation damping wave , the wave function and energy are in the form @xmath21 .\end{aligned}\ ] ]    in fig . 
 [ fig1 ] , the concerned system and three types of possible solutions within the lead  are illustrated schematically . 
 for the case of a hermitian @xmath6 , the solutions are the form of @xmath22  and @xmath23  with @xmath24 or @xmath25  definitely . in the case of non - hermitian @xmath6 
 , @xmath26 may appear associated with the complex energy level . in case of absence of the solution @xmath27 
 , full real spectrum achieves , which shows the existence of the stationary states . 
 it indicates that the lead acts as a channel to balance the gain or loss in the system @xmath6 .    at certain points 
 @xmath28 , the system makes transitions between wavefunctions @xmath29 and @xmath30 ,  as well as between @xmath31 and @xmath27 . 
 the former transition is actually a switch between real and imaginary @xmath32 , preserving the reality of the eigen energy . 
 then the transition point locates at @xmath33 ,  i.e.,@xmath34which usually occurs in the case of hermitian @xmath6 . 
 the later transition only occurs in a non - hermitian system , eigen energy switching between real and complex values . 
 in contrast to the above case , the transition point ( referred as exceptional point ) depends on the structure of the non - hermitian @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath35it indicates that a unidirectional plane wave exists in the lead when an appropriate  non - hermitian @xmath6 is connected . 
 it has both fundamental as well as practical implications . 
 this result reveals the exceptional point from an alternative way : it is the threshold of the balance between the non - hermitian  subcluster and the lead . from a practical perspective 
 , the unidirectional - plane - wave solution at the exceptional point can be used to realize the reflectionless absorption and persistent emission in the experiment . to characterize the probability generation ( negative in the case of the dissipation ) of the non - hermitian cluster , we introduce the current operator @xcite@xmath36where @xmath37 $ ] .    for three types of wave functions @xmath38 , @xmath39  and @xmath40 , the corresponding currents can be obtained as @xmath41 } . 
 \notag\end{aligned}\]]we can see that @xmath42  is time - independent and is conservative along the lead , representing a steady flow or the dynamic balance , while @xmath43  is non - periodically time - dependent , indicating the unbalance of the state . 
 in other word , the mechanism of the reality of the spectrum is the balance between the source ( or drain ) and the channel of the probability flow . 
 then the exceptional point is the threshold of such dynamic balance , corresponding to the unidirectional - plane - wave , i.e. , @xmath44  or @xmath45 . 
 then the probability generation for the exceptional point is@xmath46which the sign indicates that the cluster is a source or drain , then it is referred as critical current in this paper . 
 unlike the situation in traditional quantum mechanics , the magnitude of the current @xmath47  does not represent the absolute current in traditional quantum mechanics because the corresponding eigenstate is not normalized under the dirac inner product . 
 we will demonstrate and explain these points through the following illustrative example . 
 we would like to point out that , there is another type of the exceptional point , arising from the transition of two types of wave functions @xmath27 and @xmath48 , which is beyond our interest .      in this subsection 
 , we investigate two simple exactly solvable systems to illustrate the main idea of this paper . in order to exemplify the above mentioned analysis of relating the wavefunction within the lead and the eigenvalue 
 , we take @xmath6  to be the simplest non - hermitian networks to construct two types of exemplified systems . 
 type i is a uniform chain with a complex potential at one end and type ii is a uniform chain with a complex hopping at one end . in the following , we present the analytical results in the framework of above mentioned for the two models in order to perform a comprehensive study . 
 the type i hamiltonian has the form @xmath49where @xmath50  is a complex number . 
 according to bethe ansatz method , the wavefunction @xmath15  can be expressed as    @xmath51    and the schrdinger equations for @xmath52 is    @xmath53 f^{k}\left ( 1\right ) . 
 \notag\end{aligned}\ ] ]    submitting @xmath15  into the schrdinger equation , we have@xmath54which is the reflection amplitude for the scattering state . 
 now we are interested in the wavefunction with complex eigen energy . 
 the existence of the solution @xmath27  requires@xmath55which lead to @xmath56 with im@xmath57 . 
 then we conclude that there is a unique complex solution within the region im@xmath58 and the system has full real spectrum if the potential is in the rest region . at the boundary 
 , we have @xmath59which indicates a circle of radius @xmath60 in the complex plane . 
 the phase diagram is sketched in fig . 
 [ fig3 ] ( a ) . 
 then the corresponding wavefunction has the form@xmath61which represents a unidirectional plane wave with energy@xmath62accordingly , the critical current is @xmath63which accords with the intuition that a positive imaginary potential can be a source and a negative imaginary potential can be a drain . 
 however , unlike the situation in traditional quantum mechanics , the magnitude of the current @xmath47  does not represent the absolute current in traditional quantum mechanics because the eigenstate is not normalized under the dirac inner product . 
 -symmetric networks : ( a ) two separable semi - infinite chains with the complex potential and ( b ) with the complex hopping at the end . 
 ( c ) when an arbitrary semi - infinite system and its conjugate counterpart are connected at infinity , a @xmath3-symmetric system are constructed.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    before further discussion of the implication of the obtained result , two distinguishing features need to be mentioned . 
 firstly , the non - hermitian system can have full real spectrum even though there is no symmetry required . 
 secondly , there is only one possible complex energy level rather than complex conjugate pairs . 
 thus there is no level coalescing occurring at the exceptional point . 
 both of these differ from that of a finite @xmath64-symmetric system . in the following example 
 , it will be shown that such features are not exclusive to the complex potential . 
 the type ii hamiltonian has the form@xmath65which is a different type of the non - hermitian model in contrast to the type i. here @xmath66  is a complex number . in the following , we will perform a parallel investigation with the current hamiltonian . 
 the bethe ansatz wave function has the form@xmath67substituting @xmath15  to the schrdinger equation,@xmath68we obtain the reflection amplitude@xmath69the existence of the solution @xmath27requires@xmath70similarly , we conclude that there are two complex solutions within the region @xmath71re@xmath72 , and the system has full real spectrum if @xmath66  is in the region @xmath73re@xmath74 . 
 the phase diagram is sketched in fig . 
 [ fig2 ] ( b ) . the boundary can be expressed as@xmath75 
 ^{2}+% \left [ \text{im}\left ( \kappa _ { c}\right ) \right ] ^{2}\right\ } ^{2}=\left [ \text{re}\left ( \kappa _ { c}\right ) \right ] ^{2}-\left [ \text{im}\left ( \kappa _ { c}\right ) \right ] ^{2 } ,   \label{boundary_cc}\]]which is a lemniscate of bernoulli in the complex plane . 
 then the corresponding eigen wave functions at the boundary have the form@xmath76where @xmath77is real . 
 the wave functions @xmath78  represent unidirectional plane waves with energy @xmath79 , respectively . 
 this indicates that a complex - coupling dimer is a different type of basic element for a discrete non - hermitian system in comparison with complex potential . 
 there are two eigenstates corresponding to a single exceptional point . in virtue of the critical current @xmath80 
 , one can see that the complex - coupling dimer  acts as a source for @xmath81  but a drain for @xmath82 . 
 it is noted that both above two examples are not symmetric , which show that the symmetry is not the necessary condition for the occurrence of full real spectrum . 
 the underlying mechanism can be explained as the balance between the source ( or drain ) and the channel . in this sense , 
 a semi - infinite chain can act as a source ( or drain ) to balance the original drain ( or source ) . 
 the exceptional point is the threshold of such balance . 
 this point will be elucidated in details in the section [ relation with pt ] . 
 so far we have shown that there exist a class of semi - infinite non - hermitian non-@xmath3  symmetric systems possessing fully real spectra . 
 the occurrence of complex levels in such systems , or quantum transition , is not accompanied by the spontaneous symmetry breaking , but the delocalization - localization transition of wave functions . 
 so it is interesting to consider the connection between the obtained results and the well developed non - hermitian @xmath3-symmetric quantum mechanics . 
 we start the analysis with the simple configuration , which can constructed from @xmath52 ( @xmath83 ) and its @xmath3  counterpart @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , as sketched in figs . 
 [ fig3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) . here 
 the action of the parity operator @xmath1 is defined as @xmath86 and the time - reversal operator @xmath87 as @xmath88 . 
 the hamiltonians are written as@xmath89and@xmath90obviously , they are @xmath3-symmetric and have all features of typical pseudo - hermitian systems : ( i ) they have the same phase diagrams in fig . 
 ( [ fig2 ] ) as their corresponding sub - systems @xmath52  and @xmath91 . at the exceptional points , 
 two eigen functions coalesce an entire plane wave within the whole space except the @xmath92th site . 
 ( ii ) the complex levels come in conjugate pairs . 
 @xmath3-symmetry of the eigen functions break . 
 this toy model shows us the essence of symmetry breaking : the delocalization - localization transition of wave functions in each sub - system . 
 at this point we are ready to move to a more complete description , considering an inseparable system . 
 we start from the corresponding solutions of the hamiltonians @xmath93  and @xmath94 , which actually can be obtained by applying time - reversal operation , i.e. , taking complex conjugation for the obtained solutions of the hamiltonians @xmath52  and @xmath83 . 
 it is interesting to find that the real eigen - valued solutions between @xmath95  and @xmath96  ( @xmath83  and @xmath97 ) can match with each other due to the fact that@xmath98for both examples in the eqs . 
 ( [ r_cp ] ) and ( [ r_cc ] ) . in other words , 
 all the real eigen - valued solutions will not change if two systems @xmath99  and @xmath96  ( @xmath83  and @xmath97 ) are connected at the infinity , as sketched in fig . 
 [ fig3 ] ( c ) . 
 it is presumable that the similar situation could occur in finite system , i.e. , a semi - infinite non-@xmath3 symmetric system can be regarded as the rudiment of the corresponding finite @xmath3-symmetric system . 
 we will demonstrate this point through the following illustrative examples , which are finite versions of combined @xmath52  and @xmath96  ( @xmath83  and @xmath94 ) . 
 a sketch of such systems are given in figs . 
 [ fig4 ] ( a ) and [ fig4 ] ( b ) . 
 the potential example * *  * * is a @xmath3 symmetric  non - hermitian @xmath100-site chain with complex on - site potential at two ends , which has the hamiltonian @xmath101it is a @xmath3 symmetric model , i.e. , @xmath102=0 $ ] , where the action of the parity operator @xmath1 is defined as @xmath103 and the time - reversal operator @xmath87 as @xmath88 .  for infinite @xmath100 
 , it becomes the combination of the systems @xmath52  and @xmath96 . for finite @xmath100 
 , it is an extension version of the model proposed in the previous paper ref . 
 @xcite . by using the standard bethe ansatz method , 
 the solution is determined by the critical equation @xmath104where@xmath105   \\ & & + \sin \left [ k(n+1)\right ] + 2\text{re}\left ( e^{i\theta } \right ) \sin \left ( kn\right ) . 
 \notag\end{aligned}\]]accordingly , the exceptional point can be obtained by the equations liang jin , l . 
 jin@xmath106it is difficult to get the explicit solutions of the eq . 
 ( critical_condition ) for finite @xmath100 . 
 nevertheless , the equation about d@xmath107d@xmath32  can be reduced to@xmath108 + \cos \left [ k_{c}(n+1)\right ]   & & \\ + 2\text{re}\left ( e^{i\theta } 
 \right ) \cos \left ( k_{c}n\right ) \approx 0 & & \notag\end{aligned}\]]by taking the approximation @xmath109 in the large @xmath100  limit . 
 it is easy to find that the existence of real @xmath28 solution  requires im@xmath110 and @xmath111 . 
 it is in accordance with result in the corresponding semi - infinite system . 
 the dimer example * *  * * can be described by the hamiltonian@xmath112which corresponds to the combination of two systems @xmath83  and @xmath113 . by the same procedure as that for @xmath114 
 , we find that the critical equation for finite @xmath100 is @xmath115 + \chi _ { 1}\sin \left [ k\left ( n-1\right ) \right ]   & & \\ 
 -\sin \left [ k\left ( n+1\right ) \right ] = 0 & &   \notag\end{aligned}\]]where@xmath116 in addition , the exceptional point for large @xmath100 is determined by the equations @xmath117and@xmath118which leads to the same results as the eqs . 
 ( [ boundary_cc ] ) and ( cc1 ) . 
 it has been shown by the * *  * * @xmath3-symmetric quantum theory , beyond the exceptional points the complex levels in both above two models come in conjugate pairs @xcite and the @xmath3  symmetry of * *  * * the corresponding eigen functions break . nevertheless according to our above analysis 
 , the occurrence of the complex level should be accompanied by the delocalization - localization transition of the corresponding wave function . 
 we perform numerical simulation of eigen functions for finite size system to demonstrate this connection . in fig . 
 fig5 , we plot the eigenfuctions with complex eigen values including real and imaginary parts for the models @xmath114  and @xmath119 , respectively . * *  * * it shows that the * *  * * @xmath3 * *  * * symmetry  of all the eigen functions break and are local , which accords with our analysis . 
 the above results are helpful to understand the mechanism of the hermiticity of a non - hermitian system . 
 it is well known that the existence of the full real spectra of two above @xmath3  systems is attributed to  the balance between the source and drain . 
 nevertheless , this description can not provide an explanation for the exceptional point and symmetry breaking since the @xmath3 symmetry of the hamiltonian seems to maintain such a balance always . 
 based on the investigations of above two subsections , we can reach the following picture : a finite non - hermitian cluster can act as a source ( or drain ) , while a semi - infinite lead can act as a tunnel to release the current caused by the source ( drain ) . 
 a semi - infinite lead has its own threshold to carry the current , which is characterized by the onset of complex energy level , or unsteady current . 
 then the  exceptional point in this sense is the threshold of the balance between source ( or drain ) and the lead . 
 it leads to another signature of the point , delocalization - localization transition of the corresponding wave function .    as for a finite @xmath3-symmetric system in the form @xmath114and @xmath119 , 
 the source and drain is always in balance within the unbroken region . 
 the consistency of the phase diagrams between the finite @xmath0-symmetric system with large @xmath100  and the corresponding semi - infinite systems shows that the exceptional points are caused by the same mechanism . 
 then the essence of the symmetry breaking is the unbalance between the source ( drain ) and the uniform chain , rather than that between source and drain . loosely speaking , 
 the symmetry breaking is due to that the uniform chain blocks the current from the source and drain . on the other hand , the accordance between the results of these @xmath3  systems with large @xmath100  and that of semi - infinite systems implies that a lead can act as a multifunctional  source ( or drain ) to match a drain ( or source ) . 
 we would like to emphasize the difference between two types of non - hermitian elements , complex on - site potential and non - hermitian hopping amplitude , by means of the current @xmath120  for the eigenstate @xmath121  of the hamiltonian @xmath114  and @xmath122 . in fig . 
 [ fig6 ] , we plot the current @xmath123  for all the eigenstates @xmath124  of finite - size systems for @xmath114  and @xmath119 . 
 it shows that the signs of the currents are independent of @xmath32 for @xmath114 , but dependent of @xmath32 for @xmath119 . 
 a certain non - hermitian dimer can be a source or drain for two different eigenstates , which is different from a complex potential . 
 in this section we will apply the above theoretical results to simple accessible examples to investigate the dynamic behavior for local initial states . 
 this may provide some insights into the application in practice . 
 firstly , we focus on the phenomenon of the persistent emission .  consider an arbitrary local initial state on the lead in the system at the exceptional point . 
 the initial state can always be written in the form @xmath125where @xmath126  represents the superposition of the scattering states with different @xmath32.it is presumable that the probability of all the scattering states transfers to infinity  after a sufficient long time , and then only the unidirectional plane wave survives . to demonstrate and verify this analysis , 
 numerical simulations are performed for two typical initial states : an incoming gaussion wavepacket and a delta - pulse at the scattering center . a gaussian wavepacket with momentum @xmath127 and initial center @xmath128 has the form 
 @xmath129where @xmath130 is the normalization factor and the half - width of the wavepacket is @xmath131 . 
 here we take @xmath132 , @xmath133  and @xmath134 . 
 the concerned system is described by the hamiltonian in the eq . 
 ( [ h_1 ] ) with @xmath135 , which corresponds to the persistent emission of the plane wave with momentum @xmath136 . 
 the profiles of the evolved wave functions are plotted in figs . 
 [ fig7 ] ( a ) and [ fig7 ] ( b ) . 
 one can see the profile of the wave and the corresponding phase velocity from the figures ,  and after a little long time the evolved wave functions accord with the plane wave of    @xmath137 , \\ 
 \text{im}\left ( \left\langle j\right 
 . \left\vert \phi \left ( t\right ) \right\rangle \right )   & \sim & \sin \left [ \left ( \pi /4\right ) j+2jt\cos \left ( \pi /4\right ) \right ] , \end{aligned}\ ] ]    within the finite region along the lead , approximately . 
 this result has implications in two aspects : * *  * * firstly , we achieve a better understanding of the imaginary potential . 
 we found that a complex potential always corresponds to the wave vector of the unidirectional plane wave , which is determined by eq . 
 ( [ potentialk ] ) . * *  * * secondly , it provides a way * *  * * to measure the complex potential in the experiment .    on the other hand , 
 it is presumable that the reflectionless absorbtion should naturally be reflected in the dynamics of the wavepacket with the momenta around @xmath28 due to the continuity of the reflection coefficient in the vicinity of the exceptional point @xmath28 . 
 consider an incoming gaussian wavepacket with momentum @xmath138 and initial center @xmath128 , which can always be written as @xmath139where @xmath140 denotes the plane wave with momentum @xmath32 , and  @xmath141d@xmath32 is the normalization factor . 
 it is a superposition of the plane waves with momenta around @xmath28 , which have small reflection coefficients . 
 therefore there is small probability being reflected for the wavepacket . 
 the optimal situations to achieve the reflectionless absorbtion of a wavpacket are determined by the conditions@xmath142which minimizes the reflectional probability . 
 straightforward derivation indicates that the optimal complex - potential ( hopping ) scattering center system requires @xmath143  ( @xmath144 ) and the momentum of the corresponding reflectionless wave is @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) .    to demonstrate and verify this analysis , 
 numerical simulations are performed for two initial wavepackets with @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath147 , respectively . 
 the concerned system is described by the hamiltonian in the eq . 
 ( [ h_1 ] ) with @xmath143 , which corresponds to the reflectionless plane wave with momentum @xmath145 . 
 the profiles of the evolved wave functions are plotted in figs . 
 [ fig8 ] ( a ) and fig8 ( b ) . 
 the reflection coefficients of the two wavepackets are @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively . 
 it shows that wider wavepacket leading to lower reflection rate , which accords with the previous theoretical analysis . 
 in summary , the mechanism of the non - hermiticity of a discrete non - hermitian system has been investigated in an alternative way . 
 it is shown that the symmetry is not the necessary condition for the occurrence of full real spectrum . 
 the underlying mechanism can be explained as the balance between a non - hermitian cluster and a semi - infinite chain : the semi - infinite lead can play a complete role to balance a finite non - hermitian cluster , resulting in a full real spectrum . 
 it is also shown that the threshold of such balance is the exceptional point of the semi - infinite non - hermitian systems , the occurrence of the corresponding complex eigenstates experienced the delocalization - localization transition . 
 furthermore , at the exceptional point , the eigen wave function is shown to be a unidirectional plane wave . 
 practical application of this feature to the dynamics of the wave packet demonstrates the phenomena of the self - sustained emission and reflectionless absorbtion ,  which could be very useful for the design of quantum devices .

36,"there has been considerable recent interest on the general dynamics of the glass transitions in bulk polymer systems@xcite . 
 a central experimental law which controls the rate of transition was long ago formulated by vogel , fulcher and tammann@xcite ; the empirical vft law of transition rates reads @xmath0 \right\ } , \label{intro1}\ ] ] wherein @xmath1 is the free energy of thermal activation . 
 the vft thermal activation law is quite similar to the well known arrhenius@xcite thermal activation law except for the temperature singularity in the denominator on the right hand side of eq.([intro1 ] ) . 
 the singularity occurs at a dynamical temperature @xmath2 which is somewhat lower than the thermodynamic glass transition temperature @xmath3 . 
 the singularity is thereby never quite attained . 
 nevertheless , the critical slowing down of the vft eq.([intro1 ] ) is experimentally well obeyed in bulk polymer glasses . there 
 exist somewhat different physical views@xcite as to why the vft law might theoretically be true . 
 nevertheless there is presently no agreed upon theory of eq.([intro1 ] ) . 
 our purpose is to derive the vft thermal law through the following quite simple quantum mechanical considerations . 
 the transition rate per unit time for an activated process involves an absolute squared transition amplitude ( matrix element ) times a density of final states . 
 the logarithm of the density of final states represents the final entropy . 
 thus , the quantum mechanical rule for computing transition rates is that @xmath4 , \label{intro2}\ ] ] wherein @xmath5 is the entropy of activation to a state with energy @xmath6 . 
 the theoretical problem is to deduce the nature of the excitations@xcite and compute the entropy of activation from the the logarithm of the final state phase space magnitude @xmath7    the polymer glass excitation configurations@xcite pictured in fig.[fig1 ] are of two types : ( i ) there are - in the bulk of the polymer - closed chains of atoms referred to as _ closed _ strings . 
 ( ii ) also , there are open polymer chains which begin and end on the boundary surfaces of the bulk polymer and are referred to as _ open _ strings . 
 it will be shown below that the closed strings have an entropy obeying the vft thermal activation eq.([intro1 ] ) . 
 on the other hand , the open string configurations with end points in the neighbourhood of surface boundaries obey shifted thermal activation laws . 
 the distinction between the thermal activation properties of open and closed strings is crucial for an understanding of surface effects which are of importance for thin films@xcite . 
 the vft thermal activation law holds only for the bulk polymer . by contrast 
 , the dynamical sinularity temperature @xmath2 decreases as the ratio of boundary surface are to the bulk volume , @xmath8 , increases . 
 consequently , the singularity temperature is sharply lowered@xcite when @xmath9 is decreased to a few nanometers . 
 closed polymer chains in the form of `` polygons '' are treated as a self avoiding random polygons . the number of _ closed self avoiding polygon _ 
 polymer chains containing @xmath10 links is thought to obey@xcite @xmath11 wherein @xmath12 denotes the connectivity . 
 the de gennes scaling law@xcitein @xmath13 dimensions for the exponent @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 wherein @xmath16 is the fractal dimension of the complete closed chain configuration . in mean field theory@xcite 
 we have @xmath17 if @xmath18 denotes the activation energy per link for a mobile closed chain ( closed string ) , then the energy @xmath19 determines the entropy via eqs.([intro3 ] ) , ( [ closed1 ] ) and ( [ closed4 ] ) according to @xmath20 wherein @xmath21 the activation entropy as a function of energy exhibits a minimum as shown in fig . 
 [ fig2 ] . for stable entropy functions , 
 the maximum entropy principle dictates upward convexity while metastable entropy functions exhibit downward convexity . since the density of final states @xmath22 , 
 rates become slower as the minimum activation entropy is approached .    in terms of the temperature @xmath23 , 
 @xmath24 we have at @xmath2 the activated energy singularity @xmath25 . \label{closed8}\ ] ] eqs.([closed3 ] ) , ( [ closed5 ] ) and ( [ closed8 ] ) imply @xmath26   \nonumber \\   & \ & 
 \ -(3-\alpha)k_b\ln \left[\frac{(t}{(t - t_0)}\right ] . 
 \label{closed9}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    using eqs.([intro2 ] ) , ( [ closed3 ] ) and ( [ closed9 ] ) , we may now complete the proof that the closed chain activation law has the vft form given by eq.([intro1 ] ) . 
 explicitly , we have @xmath27^{2.8 }   \nu_\infty e^{s_\infty /k_b}\ . \label{closed10}\end{aligned}\ ] ] in practice , the vft activation process is often observed by measuring viscosity , @xmath28 wherein @xmath29 is the mass density and @xmath30 is the length scale of the polymer links . in this regard , the prediction for the activation free energy @xmath31 is subject to an experimental test of the scaling critical index in eq.([closed2 ] ) . 
 consider the problem of how much activation energy would be required to remove a given section of chain from the condensed matter piece of polymer . 
 if the given section of chain were deep within the polymer , the removal would be quite difficult . 
 for example , if one exerted a force on the given chain section , then it would become knotted with other polymer chain sections and would be rendered immobile . 
 on the other hand , if the given section of chain was entirely located in the neighborhood of the surface boundary of the polymer , then it would be relatively easier to peel the chain off the surface . 
 let us consider , in more detail , the activation energy to slide a section of polymer chain along a given path . 
 such an activation energy has been denoted above as @xmath32 per link of the chain section . 
 furthermore , let @xmath33 denote the distance from a chain link to the boundary surface . by the above physical arguments 
 we expect @xmath34 to sharply decrease as @xmath35 . from eq.([closed6 ] ) we expect , for uniform connectivity ( @xmath36 ) , the dynamical singularity temperature to be a decreasing function of @xmath33 varying as @xmath37 in a local density theory@xcite , @xmath38 may be parameterized by @xmath39 in which the coherence length is related to the density @xmath40 the @xmath41 relation invalidates the vft eq.([intro1 ] ) for the case of very thin polymer films . 
 a derivation has been provided for vft activated transition rates in bulk polymer glasses . 
 our derivation depends on the micro - canonical counting of the number of closed polymer chain configurations within the bulk glassy system . 
 the configuration counting is mapped into the self avoiding polygon problem . 
 the activation energy @xmath18 per link determining the chain mobility also determines the dynamical glass transition temperature in the empirical vft law . 
 the critical indices employed are calculated as in flory s theory . 
 the chain movements also lend strong support to `` co - operative '' motion inside the bulk . 
 it is also to be stressed that the dynamical glass transition temperature , @xmath42 , varies with the distance from the surface boundary through that a coherence length scale of about a few nanometers . 
 this surface effect is due to the fact polymer strings localized near the surface boundary are more mobile than the polymer chains embedded in the bulk . for sufficiently thin films , 
 the vft activation law thereby becomes modified as in eqs .

37,"the principal limit in high precision measurements and optics communication is given by the quantum fluctuations of light . for several years , in order to beat the standard quantum limit , a number of methods consisting in generating squeezed states of light have been developed @xcite . in connection with quantum information technology the quantum features of the polarization of light 
 has raised a lot of attention . 
 the generation of polarization squeezing has been achieved experimentally by mixing an opo - produced squeezed vacuum with a coherent field @xcite , or more recently by mixing two independent opa - originated squeezed beams on a polarizing beamsplitter @xcite . 
 several schemes using kerr - like media have also been proposed @xcite , and very recently , matsko et al . 
 proposed to propagate a linearly polarized field through a self - rotative atomic medium to produce vacuum squeezing on the orthogonal polarization @xcite . 
 the kerr - like interaction between cold cesium atoms placed in a high finesse optical cavity and a circularly polarized field has been studied in our group and a field noise reduction of 40% has been obtained @xcite . 
 we recently observed experimental evidence of polarization squeezing when the incoming polarization is linear @xcite . in this paper , we present a theoretical investigation of polarization squeezing generated by an ensemble of x - like 4-level atoms illuminated by a linearly polarized field . to be as realistic as possible , 
 the experimental parameters values of ref @xcite are taken as references . 
 in the first part of the paper , we give a detailed study of the steady state and show that self - rotation is responsible for polarization switching and saturation leads to tristability . 
 we derive simple analytical criteria for the existence of elliptically polarized solutions and the stability of the linearly polarized solution . 
 this steady state study is essential to figure out the interesting working points for squeezing . in the second part , we focus on the case 
 in which the polarization remains linear ( below the ps threshold ) and show that both the linearly polarized field mode and the orthogonal vacuum mode are squeezed . 
 analytical spectra are derived in the low saturation limit and enable a clear discussion of the physical effects responsible for polarization squeezing ; in particular , we demonstrate that self - rotation is associated to strong atomic noise terms preventing vacuum squeezing at low frequency . on the other hand , saturation accounts for the squeezing on the mean field and crossed - kerr effect 
 enables to retrieve vacuum squeezing at high frequency . 
 the analytical results are compared with a full quantum calculation . 
 finally , we derive the stokes parameters @xcite and relate their fluctuations to those of the vacuum field . 
 the vacuum squeezing obtained is then equivalent to the squeezing of one stokes parameter , the so - called _ polarization squeezing _ @xcite . 
 the system considered in this paper is a set of n 4-level cold atoms interacting in an optical cavity driven by a linearly polarized field as represented in fig [ fig1 ] . 
 we denote @xmath0 the slowly - varying envelope operators associated with the @xmath1 components of the light @xcite . 
 they are defined from the standard linear polarization components    @xmath2    the atomic frequencies are both equal to @xmath3 . 
 the field frequency is @xmath4 and the detunings from atomic resonance are equal on both transitions to @xmath5 . 
 the 4-level system is described using collective operators for the n atoms of the ensemble , the optical dipoles being defined in the rotating frame associated to the laser frequency ( e.g. @xmath6 ) . 
 the coupling constant between the atoms and the field is defined by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the atomic dipole and @xmath9 . with this definition , 
 the mean square value of the field is expressed in number of photons per second . as in fig 
 [ fig1 ] , the population of level 3 decays with rate @xmath10 on level 1 and with rate @xmath11 on level 2 , the dipole decay rate being @xmath12 . 
 we consider the case of saturated optical pumping and neglect the relaxation rate of the ground states populations . 
 this approximation is well verified for alkali cold atoms @xcite . with these conventions , 
 the atom - field hamiltonian is    @xmath13\ ] ]    the atomic evolution is then governed by a set of quantum heisenberg - langevin equations    @xmath14    note that we have not reproduced all the atomic equations , but only those of interest for the following . 
 the langevin operators @xmath15 are @xmath16-correlated and their correlation functions are calculated via the quantum regression theorem @xcite . 
 we consider a ring cavity with @xmath17 the transmission of the cavity coupling mirror , @xmath18 the cavity resonance frequency closest to @xmath4 and @xmath19 the cavity round - trip time . 
 the cavity dephasing is @xmath20 . 
 the incoming quantum fields are @xmath21 and the field equations read    @xmath22 
 the atomic steady state is readily obtained by setting the time derivatives to zero and using the fact that a langevin operator mean value is zero . defining saturation parameters @xmath23 for both polarizations ,    @xmath24    the atomic steady state is given by    @xmath25    @xmath26 are the rabi frequencies and @xmath27 is the coupling saturation parameter which plays a symmetrical role with respect to both polarization components . for an x - polarized field , @xmath28 is directly related to the intracavity field intensity . 
 it is well known that such a coupled system may exhibit polarization switching when driven by a linearly polarized field @xcite . 
 in fact , the intracavity field intensities depend on the atomic dephasings @xmath29 and absorptions @xmath30    @xmath31    with @xmath32 and @xmath33 the linear dephasing and absorption in the absence of saturation . these quantities depend in turn on the intensities to yield a complex coupled system . in order to derive analytical criteria for polarization switching , 
 we follow the method given in @xcite and decompose dephasings and losses into their linear and non - linear parts ,    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the non - linear circular birefringence and dichroism , related to the ellipticity @xmath37 @xcite    @xmath38    thus , as pointed out in the literature @xcite , the optical pumping induces non - linear self - rotation ( sr ) of elliptically polarized light . 
 it will be shown in the next section that this effect is responsible for ps in a cavity configuration . 
 let us first focus on the solution for the @xmath1 components . 
 normalizing all the dephasings and absorptions by @xmath39 ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , eqs ( [ aplus]),([amoins ] ) read in steady state    @xmath42    with @xmath43 the maximal intracavity intensity in the absence of absorption . replacing ( [ spm ] ) in ( [ epsilon ] ) , we derive the equation for @xmath44 : non zero solutions correspond to elliptically polarized states . 
 after straightforward calculations , we obtain    @xmath45    the first trivial solution corresponds to the linearly polarized field . 
 it follows from the second equation and ( [ phil]),([al ] ) that elliptically polarized states may exist as soon as the existence criterion @xmath46 is satisfied    @xmath47    note that the absorption brings a positive contribution to the existence of asymmetrical solutions : this is due to the fact that non - linear circular dichroism produces `` self - elliptization '' of the field 
 . however , this criterion gives no information on the stability of the solutions . in order to get some physical insight into this complicated problem 
 it is useful to look at the evolution of the linearly polarized solution .      in this section , 
 we give a simple interpretation of ps as the threshold for laser oscillations . 
 let us consider the linearly polarized solution along the x axis . 
 the adiabatic elimination of the atomic variables leads to    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the intracavity field decay rate . in ( [ equationay2 ] ) 
 all terms have zero mean value and are of order 1 in fluctuations ( @xmath50 ) . using @xmath51 , 
 one obtains    @xmath52    owing to sr the fluctuations of the orthogonal mode undergo a phase dependent gain . 
 a similar equation has already been derived in previous theoretical works in a single pass scheme @xcite . in our configuration 
 the presence of the cavity will lead to oscillations of this mode as soon as the phase sensitive gain is larger than the losses . 
 this condition may be expressed as follows    @xmath53    obviously , the linearly polarized solution is not stable when @xmath54 . 
 however , the adiabatical elimination of the atomic variables does not _ a priori _ take all causes for instability into account . 
 yet , we checked that this threshold analysis was consistent with a numerical calculation of the atom - field stability matrix . in the following we use @xmath55 as a stability criterion for the linearly polarized solution 
 nevertheless , it does not yield information on the stability of the elliptically polarized solutions , which has been evaluated numerically . + besides , the ability of a system to produce squeezing being closely related to its static properties , the fluctuations of the vacuum field are expected to be strongly modified in the vicinity of the ps threshold . since eq ( [ equationay3 ] ) 
 is similar to that of a degenerate optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) below the threshold @xcite , perfect squeezing could be obtained via sr . 
 however , the atomic noise is not included in ( [ equationay3 ] ) and is to be carefully evaluated .      , 
 the cavity dephasing corresponding to ps is @xmath57 , close to @xmath58 as given by the ps criterion . 
 when the cavity detuning is scanned from the right , the linear solution is stable until @xmath59 and unstable afterwards . 
 then the elliptically polarized solutions , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , become stable for @xmath62 . 
 we plot also the resonance peaks ( dashed line ) for the cavity with @xmath63 or @xmath64 atoms , in the absence of sr phenomenon.,width=377 ]    ps is caused by a competition between the two @xmath1 optical pumping processes . 
 we can understand the main features of this effect by restraining ourselves to the case where absorption and saturation are negligible : @xmath65 and @xmath66 . neglecting the excited state populations , the optical pumping equations for the ground state populations are    @xmath67    so that the @xmath68 component tends to pump the atoms into level 2 , the @xmath69 into 1 , and , in steady state , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . 
 the circular birefringence @xmath72 is proportional to the ground state population difference , and consequently , to the intensity difference @xmath73 [ see ( [ epsilon ] ) ] . 
 this simple analysis allows for relating self - rotation to competitive optical pumping and will help us interpret the resonance curves . 
 + under the previous conditions both criteria ( [ critereexistence ] ) and ( [ criterestabilite ] ) are equivalent and it follows that the linearly polarized solution bifurcates into an elliptically polarized state for @xmath74 . 
 consequently , ps is observed as soon as the linear dephasing is greater than half the cavity bandwidth ( @xmath75 ) . 
 this represents an easily accessible condition from an experimental point of view : in our cesium experiment using a magneto - optical trap @xcite , the number of atoms interacting with the light is @xmath76 . to find realistic experimental parameters , we assimilate each one of our x - model transitions to the transition @xmath77 of the @xmath78 line of @xmath79 , for which @xmath80 mhz . 
 the square of the coupling constant @xmath81 is proportional to the ratio of the diffusion section at resonance to the transversal surface @xmath82 mm@xmath83 of the beam , @xmath84 hz . 
 the cavity transmission is 10% . to obtain a sufficiently high non - linearity , keeping the absorption low , a good detuning is @xmath85 , so that an approximate value for the linear detuning is @xmath86 . 
 note that the saturation parameters of ( [ s ] ) are simply    @xmath87    the saturation intensity being @xmath88 mw / cm@xmath83 @xcite , typical values for @xmath23 are 0.1 - 1 . 
 + in fig [ fig2 ] are represented the admissible intensities for the @xmath68 and @xmath69 components versus the cavity detuning for typical experimental values of the parameters . 
 the peak centered on @xmath90 corresponds to the symmetrical solution . when the cavity is scanned from right to left 
 , the linearly polarized field ( @xmath91 ) intensity increases until the ps threshold is reached ( @xmath92 ) . 
 then one elliptically polarized state becomes stable . 
 the predominant circular component , say @xmath68 , creates , via the optical pumping process ( [ op1]-[op2 ] ) , a positive orientation of the medium @xmath93 , @xmath94 . since the atomic dephasing decreases to zero for the @xmath68 component ( @xmath95 ) , as if it were propagating in an empty cavity . 
 hence , the solution draws close to the zero - dephasing peak , that is , close to resonance in the range @xmath62 . on the other hand 
 the @xmath69 component `` sees '' all the atoms ( @xmath96 ) and breaks down to fit the peak centered on @xmath97 , which is far from resonance . in order to illustrate this interpretation of the resonance curves , 
 the two airy peaks centered on @xmath98 and @xmath97 are represented in fig [ fig2 ] . as the cavity detuning 
 is decreased both asymmetrical solutions reunite when the criterion ( [ criterestabilite ] ) is no longer satisfied and the linear solution becomes stable again . 
 these simple interpretations will help us understand the much more complex general case , when absorption and saturation come into play . 
 + as discussed in ref @xcite , taking into account the ground state relaxation rate @xmath99 yields tristability in the unsaturated optical pumping regime ( @xmath100 ) . 
 we will now show that the optical saturation also leads to tristability .      , 
 @xmath101 and @xmath102 . 
 the linear absorption is @xmath103 . 
 dashed parts indicate unstable solutions . 
 the switching occurs for @xmath104 and @xmath105 . 
 @xmath106 for @xmath107 , so that the tristability range is @xmath108 . 
 the arrows on the hysteresis cycle correspond to increasing and decreasing cavity detuning scan . 
 below are plotted the two criteria : @xmath55 giving the stability of the linear solution ( plain ) and @xmath46 giving the existence of asymmetrical solutions ( dashed).,width=491 ]    it is well - known that saturation may induce multistability for the linearly polarized field @xcite in our configuration and substantially modify the steady state . 
 when the non - linearity is sufficient , there may be three possible values for the x - polarized field intensity . 
 therefore , saturation is an additional cause of instability for the symmetrical solution . in fig [ fig3 ] 
 , we plotted the same curves as in fig [ fig2 ] , but for higher values of @xmath109 and @xmath58 . 
 as expected , the linearly polarized state solution is distorted as a consequence of the non - linear effect . 
 the effect of absorption is also clear : whereas the symmetrical peak height is reduced , the @xmath68 dominant peak height is not . 
 indeed , the @xmath68 component `` sees '' no atoms after the switching . 
 + besides , the system now exhibits tristability for a certain range of the cavity detuning . as mentioned previously the existence of asymmetrical solutions 
 is related to the positivity of @xmath46 , whereas the stability of the symmetrical solution is given by @xmath55 . 
 for instance , on fig [ fig3 ] , @xmath106 for @xmath110 and the threshold @xmath111 is reached for a dephasing @xmath112 . 
 thus , in the range @xmath113 , two different sets of asymmetrical solutions exist , in addition to the linear polarization state . 
 this phenomenon is due to the saturation experienced by the @xmath68 and @xmath69 components . 
 as expected , we checked that only the lower branch of each asymmetrical curve is stable , leading to tristability for the polarization state : linear , @xmath68-dominant or @xmath69-dominant . 
 the system switches for a different value of the cavity detuning if the cavity is scanned from left to right , or from right to left ( see fig [ fig3 ] ) . 
 hence , unlike the unsaturated case , saturation induces a multistable behavior and a hysteresis cycle now appears in the resonance curve . + 
 this brief study of the resonance curve for typical parameters leads to an essential observation : the lower branch of the bistability curve for the linear polarized field is not stable . 
 we may wonder if there is a domain of the parameter space for which it is not the case . 
 since the quantum fluctuations are expected to be most reduced in the vicinity of the lower turning point @xcite , the answer is of crucial importance for squeezing and will be treated in the next section .       as a function of @xmath109 . 
 ps is the switching threshold , @xmath114 and @xmath115 the higher and lower turning points . for certain incident intensities 
 @xmath109 three solutions ( 1,2,3 ) exist for the intracavity intensity @xmath116 , of which only one ( 3 ) is stable , instead of the usual two ( 1,3 ) in the absence of ps phenomenon . 
 , width=377 ]    to complete the analysis of the steady state , we would like to emphasize that , when the cavity is scanned , ps always happens before reaching the higher turning point of the bistability curve . 
 in order to get some insight into this complicated problem , it is worth looking at fig [ fig4 ] . 
 we plotted the typical s - shaped variation of the linearly polarized field intensity @xmath117 versus the incoming intensity @xmath109 , for a fixed value of the cavity detuning @xmath118 . 
 we choose the parameters so that there is bistability for this state of polarization and report the position of the lower ( @xmath115 ) and the higher ( @xmath114 ) turning points . in the absence of the ps phenomenon , 
 the solutions between @xmath114 and @xmath115 are unstable ( like 2 on fig [ fig4 ] ) , whereas solutions on the lower ( 1 ) and higher ( 3 ) branches are stable 
 . however the stability of the linear polarization is modified by the ps effects . to a fixed value of 
 the dephasing corresponds the ps intensity @xmath119 cancelling @xmath55 in ( [ criterestabilite ] ) ; if @xmath120 , then the linear polarization is unstable . 
 hence , if @xmath121 is satisfied in the whole parameter space , then ps occurs before reaching @xmath114 , and , consequently , the lower branch is never stable . 
 + this general feature is shown on fig [ fig5 ] , in which we represented different bistability curves as in fig [ fig4 ] . 
 the upper branch of ab is the @xmath114 curve ( the ensemble of the higher turning points when @xmath118 is varied ) , the lower branch is the @xmath115 curve . the dashed curve shows the ensemble of the intensities @xmath119 for which the polarization switches . 
 this curve is always above the @xmath114 curve , confirming that the linear polarization always becomes unstable on account of ps first . 
 what is more , we see that ps is closer to @xmath114 for low values of @xmath117 . 
 we thus expect this situation to be the most favorable to achieve squeezing via optical bistability . 
 we checked that varying the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath122 does not change the conclusion . 
 as a function of @xmath109 for field @xmath123 . 
 the three s - shaped curves correspond to different values of the cavity dephasing ( @xmath124 from left to right ) , @xmath58 and @xmath122 having the same value as in fig [ fig3 ] . 
 the ab segments represent the @xmath114 ( higher ) and @xmath115 ( lower ) curves . 
 the dashed curve is the ensemble of the intensities @xmath119 for which polarization switching occurs . 
 the system exhibits bistability for @xmath125.,width=415 ]    to conclude this section , we would like to point out that bistability , as well as ps , may disappear when the saturation is too high , as can be seen from fig [ fig4 ] . 
 however , we will focus on the low saturation case in the large detuning limit which is the most favorable case for squeezing , and provides analytical results , as well as a clear physical understanding . 
 since we are interested in the quantum fluctuations , we linearize the quantum operators around their steady state values following the standard linear input - output method @xcite . 
 the elliptically polarized solutions are not of great interest for squeezing since the predominant circular component sees no atom and the other has negligible intensity . therefore , in all the following , we focus on the linearly polarized state and study how both the mean field @xmath123 and the orthogonal vacuum field @xmath126 may be squeezed . 
 we have calculated the outgoing fields noise spectra via a full quantum treatment ( see e.g. @xcite ) involving the four - level system . 
 the outgoing fields are standardly defined from the input - output relation @xcite :    @xmath127    yet , to provide clear interpretations as well as analytical results , we derive simplified equations , first for the mean field mode @xmath123 , then for the vacuum mode @xmath126 . + a similar equation to ( [ equationay2 ] ) can be derived for the field @xmath123 with a term arising from sr in @xmath128 . in the linearization , this product of zero mean value operators vanishes , so that we only have to take saturation into account to derive the spectra of @xmath123 . 
 field squeezing owing to optical bistability has been widely studied @xcite and is known to occur on a frequency range given by the cavity bandwidth @xmath129 . 
 the most favorable configuration is the bad cavity limit : @xmath129 is greater than @xmath130 ( in our experiment , @xmath131 ) . in the large detuning limit , @xmath132 , 
 the equation for @xmath123 reads at order 3 in @xmath133 ,    @xmath134+\frac{2}{\sqrt{t}}a_x^{in } \label{ax1}\ ] ]    where @xmath123 is short for @xmath135 . 
 this simplified equation yields the classical kerr terms in @xmath136 producing squeezing . 
 note that absorption , dispersion and the associated atomic noise are not included in ( [ ax1 ] ) . 
 the spectra taking absorption and dispersion into account can be easily derived and are shown on fig [ fig7 ] . the associated susceptibility and correlation matrices , @xmath137_{kerr}$ ] and @xmath138_{kerr}$ ] , of the linear input - output theory 
 are reproduced in appendix , and the comparison with a kerr medium is discussed in @xcite . the situation is more complex for the orthogonal mode on account of sr . 
 as mentioned in sec [ opo ] , sr seems to be a very promising candidate for generating vacuum squeezing . 
 however , a careful analysis of the atomic noise , which can not be neglected , is necessary in the squeezing calculations . in the optical pumping regime 
 the circular birefringence , @xmath139 , is proportional to the ground state population difference @xmath140 ( see sec [ opticalpumping ] ) . 
 the sr effect is thus closely related to the fluctuations of @xmath141 , and consequently to the fluctuations of @xmath126 via the coupling term in @xmath142 [ eq ( [ equationay2 ] ) ] . 
 therefore , we derive general equations for @xmath143 and @xmath144 in the fourier domain , and examine their low and high frequency limits . for the sake of simplicity , absorption and linear dispersion , again , are not shown ; however , the additional terms are included in the appendix . 
 as previously we place ourselves in the large detuning limit with @xmath66 and obtain , discarding terms of order greater than @xmath145 ,    @xmath146\\ & & + \beta(\omega)\frac{2\delta_0}{n}a_x\delta j_z+\frac{2}{\sqrt{t}}\delta a_y^{in}+f_{a_y}\label{ay1}\\ -i\omega\delta j_z & = & -\gamma_p\alpha(\omega)\left[\delta j_z-\lambda(\omega)\left(1-\frac{s_x}{2}\right)\frac{n}{2}\frac{\delta s_z}{|a_x|^2}\right]+f_z\label{jz1}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    where @xmath147 is the usual stokes parameter ( see sec [ polarizationsqueezing ] ) and    @xmath148\frac{\beta(\omega)}{\lambda(\omega ) } \;\;,\;\;\;\beta(\omega)=1-\frac{s_x}{4\lambda(\omega)}\;\;,\;\;\ ; \lambda(\omega)=\frac{2\gamma - i\omega}{2(\gamma - i\omega)}\ ] ]    with @xmath149 and @xmath150 the langevin operators associated to @xmath126 and @xmath141 after the adiabatical eliminations , @xmath151 the optical pumping rate . in ( [ ay1 ] ) , the last term of the first line is a crossed kerr term and clearly contributes to squeezing . 
 we also see that the coupling with @xmath141 is strongly frequency - dependant and requires a careful investigation . in the next sections 
 , we discuss the low and high frequency limits to further simplify the previous equations and give simple interpretations for the squeezing .      , 
 @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156.,width=529 ]    again , to stress the effects on the fluctuations only due to sr , we neglect the terms in @xmath117 responsible for the kerr effect , which will be studied in the next section , and place ourselves in the optical pumping regime , keeping only terms of order 1 in @xmath133 . 
 note that this approximation consists in adiabatically eliminating the optical dipoles and neglecting the excited state populations and thus limits the analysis to the range of frequencies @xmath157 . under these conditions 
 , one has @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and eq ( [ jz1 ] ) reduces to the linearized optical pumping equation    @xmath161+f_z \label{jz2}\ ] ]    it is clear that the fluctuations of @xmath141 are governed by the time constant @xmath162 , consistently with the optical pumping approximation @xmath163 . 
 sr is effective only at low frequency . 
 plugging ( [ jz2 ] ) back into ( [ ay1 ] ) , one gets    @xmath164\delta a_y\\ & & + i\delta_0\frac{\gamma_p}{\gamma_p - i\omega}\frac{a_x^2}{|a_x|^2}\delta a_y^{\dagger}+\frac{2}{\sqrt{t}}\delta a_y^{in}+\tilde{f}_{a_y } \label{ay2}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the sr term comes with an amplitude @xmath58 ( @xmath165 ) around zero frequency , which is much greater than the usual third order saturation non - linearity . very good squeezing could be expected if it were not for the noise coming from the atoms @xmath166 , which we now study . 
 the fluctuation operator arising from atomic and field fluctuations reads    @xmath167    the second term @xmath149 is responsible for the noise due to absorption . 
 the first term includes the optical pumping noise . 
 one calculates the correlation function of @xmath150 via the quantum regression theorem @xcite    @xmath168    so that    @xmath169    in which we introduced @xmath170 the cooperativity parameter quantifying the strength of the atom - field coupling via the cavity ( @xmath171 in our cs experiment ) . 
 for @xmath172 the noise is thus much more important than the losses due to absorption and therefore has a dramatic influence on the squeezing that could have been produced by the sr term . 
 following the method given in @xcite , we derive the susceptibility and correlation matrices which are given in appendix . 
 we can then calculate the outgoing vacuum field spectrum for all the quadratures . 
 minimal and maximal spectra are plotted on fig [ fig6 ] in the `` close - to - bad '' cavity limit ( @xmath154 ) corresponding to our experimental configuration . whereas the first is close to the shot - noise level , the second is extremely noisy . in the good cavity limit 
 , the noise is even more important . 
 the conclusion is that the optical pumping process adds too much noise at zero frequency for sr to generate vacuum squeezing . 
 however , this low frequency noise does not prevent squeezing at higher frequencies . 
 if one repeats the previous calculation keeping the first order saturation terms in @xmath117 and considers frequencies @xmath173 , one finds    @xmath174    this is not surprising , since the evolution times considered are small with respect to the atomic relaxation time . 
 the system behaves as if @xmath68 and @xmath69 were independent . 
 in fact , let us consider two independent two - level systems , 1 - 4 and 2 - 3 , each with @xmath175 atoms . in the large detuning limit , one has @xmath176 and @xmath177 , and the atomic fluctuations follow the field fluctuations @xcite ( still at order 3 in @xmath178 )    @xmath179    so that , using @xmath180 , we retrieve ( [ jzkerr ] ) . 
 this equation shows that the fluctuations of @xmath141 are only caused by saturation and their contribution adds to the crossed kerr terms already mentioned in ( [ ay1 ] ) to retrieve a similar `` kerr '' equation for @xmath126 to that of @xmath123 at high frequency    @xmath181+\frac{2}{\sqrt{t}}\delta a_y^{in}+f_{a_y } \label{aykerr}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    this high frequency behavior is thus characterized by the same kerr - induced optimal squeezing on both polarization modes , consistently with the previous analysis for two independent two - level systems . 
 more precisely , the optimal squeezing spectra are the same for each mode , but involve orthogonal quadratures [ because of the sign difference in the kerr terms between ( [ ax1 ] ) and ( [ aykerr ] ) ] . 
 we now plot the outgoing fields @xmath182 squeezing spectra and discuss the squeezing optimization . 
 to derive spectra for the whole frequency range , we combine both effects by adding the matrices obtained in the two asymptotical regimes studied previously . we write the complete susceptibility and correlation matrix under the form @xmath183_y=[\chi(\omega)]_{kerr}+[\chi(\omega)]_{sr}$ ] and @xmath184_y=[\sigma(\omega)]_{kerr}+[\sigma(\omega)]_{sr}$ ] , where the kerr matrices are those obtained in the high frequency limit , and the sr matrices those obtained at low frequency ( see appendix for analytical expressions ) . 
 this approximation is good since kerr effect is negligible at low frequency compared to sr , while sr breaks down at high frequency . 
 + in fig [ fig7 ] , typical spectra for a working point close to the ps threshold are represented . 
 the parameters are chosen to be as close to the experimental situation as possible @xcite . 
 we compared these approximate spectra ( a ) with those obtained with a full 4-level calculations based on the linear input - output theory ( b ) . 
 the analytical spectra combining kerr and sr effects show indeed an excellent agreement with the exact calculations , as long as the saturation is low . 
 as shown previously , the sr spectrum is close to the shot - noise level . 
 the kerr spectrum is accurate for @xmath126 only for @xmath173 and extends on a range of several @xmath129 as expected @xcite . the combined spectrum ( a ) confirms that sr destroys completely the squeezing at low frequency and reproduces well the exact behavior ( b ) . 
 the best squeezing for @xmath126 , obtained at intermediate frequencies , is about 25% . 
 + note that the kerr spectrum in ( a ) is also valid for field @xmath123 for all frequencies and 45% of squeezing is obtained at zero frequency . 
 the situation for the mean field @xmath123 is identical to that of a circularly polarized field with intensity @xmath116 interacting with @xmath175 two - level atoms as in @xcite , for which the kerr spectrum shows good agreement with the exact spectrum .     given by the sr effect ( dashed ) , by the kerr effect ( light ) and by both effects ( dark ) . 
 ( b ) exact spectra for the mean field mode @xmath185 ( light ) and the orthogonal vacuum mode @xmath186 ( dark ) . 
 parameters values : @xmath187 , @xmath101 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath188 , @xmath189.,width=377 ]    as mentioned in sec [ competition ] , we expect squeezing to improve in the vicinity of the ps threshold . 
 we verified this behavior by plotting on fig [ fig8 ] the evolution of the spectra when the cavity is scanned while keeping the incident intensity ( @xmath190 ) constant . 
 it appears clearly that the best squeezing is obtained at the peak of the resonance curve , right before the switching . 
 this is due to the fact that , in the low saturation regime , the ps threshold is close to the point where saturation process is the most efficient .    , 
 @xmath101 , @xmath191 , @xmath188 . 
 the working points coordinates are : a ( @xmath192 , @xmath193 ) , b ( @xmath194 , @xmath195 ) , c ( @xmath196 , @xmath197 ) . the inset shows the working points positions on the resonance curve.,width=377 ]    we then study the effect of saturation and plot on fig [ fig9 ] various spectra corresponding to working points close to ps with increasing saturation . 
 the conclusion is that , for given values of the detuning @xmath122 and linear dephasing @xmath58 , there is an optimal value of @xmath117 for squeezing . 
 this is due to the fact that the range for which sr adds noise increases with the saturation and eventually destroys kerr - induced squeezing . 
 the optimal saturation value thus corresponds to a compromise between added noise and kerr squeezing in the intermediate frequency range . 
 therefore , a bad cavity is preferable ( @xmath198 ) , since kerr - induced squeezing occurs on a frequency range given by @xmath129 and sr destroys squeezing for frequencies smaller than @xmath130 . 
 spectra for different cavities are represented in fig [ fig10 ] . 
 the case @xmath154 corresponds to the experimental situation , `` close - to - bad cavity '' , the other curves to increasingly bad cavities . 
 since sr is effective on a range smaller and smaller compared to the cavity bandwidth , its effect becomes negligible , and 75% of squeezing can be obtained . 
 + the conclusion is that very interesting squeezing values can be reached in the bad cavity limit for both the mean field mode and the orthogonal field mode . in the next section , 
 we establish the link between polarization squeezing and the vacuum squeezing obtained in our system .    . 
 for each value of @xmath109 , the working point is chosen close to ps . 
 parameters : @xmath187 , @xmath101 , @xmath199.,width=377 ]     ( short dash : @xmath200 , long dash : @xmath201 , plain : @xmath202 ) . for each value of @xmath203 , 
 the saturation is optimized . 
 parameters : @xmath187 , @xmath101 , @xmath153 . , 
 the noise of the mode with orthogonal polarization with respect to the mean field is commonly referred to as polarization noise . 
 however , the study of the polarization state fluctuations requires the introduction of the quantum stokes operators @xcite    @xmath204    to be consistent with the definition of our slowly - varying envelope operators @xmath123 , @xmath126 , these stokes operators are time - dependent and expressed in number of photons per second @xcite . 
 they obey the following commutation relationships    @xmath205=0\hspace{0.7cm}and\hspace{0.7 cm } \left[s_{i}(t),s_{j}(t')\right]= 2i\epsilon_{ijk}s_{k}\delta(t - t')\end{aligned}\ ] ]    with @xmath206 and then the spectral noise densities of these operators , defined by @xmath207 , satisfy uncertainty relations    @xmath208    the coherent polarization state correspond to the case where both modes @xmath123 and @xmath126 are coherent states . 
 then the noise densities of the stokes parameters are constant and all equal to @xmath209 for @xmath210 . 
 the so called polarization squeezing is achieved if one or more of these quantities ( except @xmath211 ) is reduced below the coherent state value    @xmath212    if the mean field is x - polarized , then @xmath213 and @xmath214 . at first order in noise fluctuations , @xmath215 and @xmath216 read    @xmath217    where @xmath218 is the phase of the mean field and @xmath219 is the quadrature with angle @xmath220 of the orthogonal mode . 
 therefore the fluctuations of these two stokes parameters are proportional to the quadrature noise of @xmath126 and the polarization squeezing of @xmath221 and @xmath222 is simply related to the vacuum squeezing that we have studied in the previous sections . 
 the physical meaning of this result is clear : let us choose @xmath223 , then geometric jitter on the polarization is due to the intensity fluctuations of @xmath126 ( @xmath224 ) , whereas the fluctuations of the ellipticity are caused by the phase fluctuations ( @xmath225 ) . in the general case , 
 the squeezed and antisqueezed stokes parameters are found to be    @xmath226    note that , unlike @xcite , there is no need to lock the phase - shift difference @xmath227 , since it is automatically done in this system ; this property appears clearly in eq ( [ aykerr ] ) where @xmath228 . 
 since the new set of the stokes parameters @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 still satisfy the relationships ( [ heisenberg ] ) , we obtain polarization squeezing in our system as soon as any quadrature of the vacuum field @xmath126 is squeezed , and the results of the previous sections can be applied to the squeezed stokes component . 
 we have presented a study of polarization switching in an x - like 4-level atoms ensemble illuminated by a linearly polarized light in an optical cavity . 
 ps has been traced to self - rotation and simple criteria allow for a clear understanding of the switching effects and the multistable behavior of the system . 
 the steady state analysis enables one to figure out the interesting working points for squeezing . 
 + in terms of squeezing the respective contributions of sr and saturation have been investigated and compared to a full quantum calculation . since the propensity for squeezing of sr is cancelled by atomic noise at low frequency 
 , the squeezing originates from kerr effect . 
 the mean field mode is squeezed via the usual saturation effects , whereas the vacuum mode squeezing is induced by the mean field via crossed kerr effect . 
 both sr and crossed kerr effects can be dissociated in a bad cavity configuration , thus allowing for high squeezing values . 
 last , this vacuum squeezing is shown to be equivalent to squeezing one stokes operator .      using the input - output theory notations @xcite,@xcite , 
 we give here the expressions of the susceptibility matrix @xmath183 $ ] and the correlation matrix @xmath184 $ ] for field @xmath126 . in the high frequency limit , they resume to those derived in @xcite in the large detuning limit    @xmath233_{kerr}=\frac{1}{2\delta } \left(\begin{array}{cc }    1 & 0 \\    0 & 1 \end{array}\right )    & + \frac{1}{2\delta^2}\left (    \begin{array}{cc }    i\gamma+\omega & 0 \\    0 & -i\gamma-\omega\end{array}\right)\\    & -\frac{g^2}{2\delta^3}\left (    \begin{array}{cc }    2|a_x|^2 & \varepsilon a_x^2 \\ 
 \varepsilon a_x^{*2 } & 2|a_x|^2\end{array}\right)\end{aligned}\ ] ]    @xmath234 yields the susceptibility matrix for the vacuum mode . to retrieve the matrix for @xmath123 
 , @xmath235 should be taken equal to @xmath236 . 
 this matrix corresponds to approximating the atoms ensemble with a kerr medium : the term of order 1 in @xmath237 is the linear dephasing , the second order matrix represents dispersion and absorption and the third order term is the non - linear dephasing corresponding to the kerr effect . 
 the associated correlation matrix is      in the kerr limit , the atomic noise comes only from the frequency independent linear losses of the kerr medium , which acts as a beamsplitter for the field . 
 similar matrices can be derived for field @xmath123 in agreement with ( [ ax1 ] ) . at low frequency , however , the previous matrices have to be completed by      @xmath240_{sr } & = & \frac{\gamma_p^2}{4\gamma_{\perp}(\gamma_p^2+\omega^2)}\left(\begin{array}{cc }    1 & -a_x^2/|a_x|^2 \\ 
 -a_x^{*2}/|a_x|^2 &    1\end{array}\right)\\    & &    + \frac{\gamma_p}{2\delta(\gamma_p^2+\omega^2)}\left(\begin{array}{cc }    -2\omega & \omega+i\gamma_p\\    \omega - i\gamma_p & 0\label{sigmay}\end{array}\right)\end{aligned}\ ] ]        so that a lot of noise is reported on all the quadratures of @xmath126 for frequencies of the order of @xmath162 , as pointed out in sec [ faradaysection ] . for frequencies 
 @xmath173 , the sr noise terms vanish , allowing for crossed kerr effect to produce squeezing .","we present a theoretical study of an ensemble of x - like 4-level atoms placed in an optical cavity driven by a linearly polarized field .

38,"the tensor model was originally considered in @xcite to generalize the matrix model , which describes the two - dimensional simplicial quantum gravity , to higher dimensional cases . 
 while the matrix model is a successful tool to analyze the two - dimensional simplicial gravity , the tensor model has not been successful in this direction , partly because of the absence of analytical methods to solve it and of physically appropriate interpretations of its partition function .    in ref . 
 @xcite , a new interpretation of the rank - three tensor model was proposed . 
 namely , theory of a dynamical rank - three tensor may be regarded as that of dynamical fuzzy spaces . 
 this proposal is based on the fact that a fuzzy space is described by an algebra of functions , which can be characterized by a rank - three tensor that defines multiplication , @xmath0 . 
 this reinterpretation of the tensor model provides a new practical manner of extracting physics from the tensor model . in the original interpretation , 
 it is necessary to compute the tensor model non - perturbatively , since the large volume limit of spaces corresponds to the large loop - number limit of the feynman diagrams of the tensor model . on the contrary , under the new interpretation , 
 the semiclassical treatment of the tensor model is physically meaningful ; its classical solutions can be regarded as background fuzzy spaces , and small fluctuations around solutions as field fluctuations on fuzzy spaces . 
 another key difference from the original proposal is that rank - three is enough as the rank of tensor to describe fuzzy spaces with arbitrary dimensions . 
 this property drastically simplifies the structures of the tensor model , since various dimensional cases can be treated in a common framework . 
 the rank - three tensor model has mainly been analyzed in numerical manners by the present author @xcite . 
 in particular , for the tensor models that possess a certain gaussian type of classical solutions , it has numerically been shown that the properties of low - lying long - wavelength modes of small fluctuations around such gaussian backgrounds are in remarkable agreement with the general relativity in all the dimensional cases having been studied so far ( @xmath1 ) @xcite . 
 namely , the general relativity was found to emerge in the tensor model as an effective long - wavelength description of the tensor model around a particular class of classical background solutions . 
 this is also expected to be true in any other dimensions , since the framework and the procedure of analysis are common . 
 this paper gives a summary of the results obtained so far concerning the emergence of the general relativity in the tensor model . 
 there exist various versions of the rank - three tensor model @xcite . 
 the simplest is the one that has a real symmetric rank - three tensor as its only dynamical variable , and has the invariance under the orthogonal group . in this paper , this simplest one is considered . 
 the dynamical variable is a real - valued rank - three tensor @xmath2 , each index of which takes integers , @xmath3 . 
 the number @xmath4 is the total number of linearly independent functions on a fuzzy space , or can more physically be interpreted as the number of `` points '' forming a fuzzy space . 
 the variable @xmath2 is assumed to be totally symmetric , @xmath5 the algebra of products defined by @xmath6 is commutative but nonassociative in general . 
 therefore the tensor model in this paper is a theory of dynamical commutative _ nonassociative _ fuzzy spaces . 
 the basis of functions @xmath7 can be changed by linear transformations . 
 a simple choice of equivalence of the basis functions is to assume that bases related by the orthogonal transformations represent equivalent fuzzy spaces . 
 correspondingly , the tensor model must be invariant under the orthogonal transformation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an arbitrary element of the orthogonal group @xmath10 . 
 the definition of the system is given by a partition function , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an action with the variable @xmath2 , and must be invariant under the orthogonal group transformation ( [ eq : trans ] ) . the integration measure @xmath13 must also be invariant under ( [ eq : trans ] ) , and is defined from the invariant metric in the space of @xmath2 given by @xmath14 
 so far , the emergence of the general relativity in the tensor model has only been shown around a particular class of backgrounds in the tensor model . 
 these backgrounds have certain gaussian forms , and the algebras defined by them represent certain simple kinds of commutative _ nonassociative _ fuzzy flat spaces with arbitrary dimensions @xcite . in this section , to describe such genuine gaussian backgrounds , the indices of @xmath2 are assumed to take continuous values , while they will take finite discrete values in the actual analyses of the following sections . 
 the gaussian backgrounds have the form , @xmath15 , \label{eq : cx}\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are positive numerical constants , @xmath18 are @xmath19-dimensional continuous coordinates , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . 
 the algebra of functions @xmath22 defines a commutative _ nonassociative _ fuzzy @xmath19-dimensional flat space considered in @xcite . because of the translational symmetry of ( [ eq : cx ] ) 
 , it is generally more convenient to describe it in the momentum basis . by applying fourier transformation to the coordinate indices , one obtains the expression in the momentum basis because of the reality condition of the tensor in the coordinate basis , and one needs also an additional symmetric tensor @xmath23 for contracting the indices . 
 these details are essentially important in the mode analysis of the following sections . 
 ] as @xmath24,\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are positive numerical constants . 
 one of the motivations for considering such particular solutions is the ( partial ) computability due to the gaussian forms . 
 another is that the fuzzy spaces are physically well - behaved , because the fuzziness is well localized and the spaces are invariant under the poincare transformation , representing fuzzy @xmath19-dimensional flat spaces . 
 moreover , as shown in the next section , there exists a natural correspondence between the metric field in the general relativity and the tensor around the gaussian backgrounds in the tensor model . 
 in fact , there exist infinitely many actions that have such gaussian backgrounds as their classical solutions . 
 two explicit examples have been studied so far @xcite . 
 unfortunately , the explicit forms of the actions are very complicated and unnatural . 
 this is a serious problem , which must be investigated in future study . 
 however , what is interesting and remarkable in these actions in common is that each of them contains all the dimensional gaussian fuzzy flat spaces as its classical solutions , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : potential ] . 
 this means that all the dimensional spaces can be treated with one action in a unified manner . 
 thus , for example , it is in principle possible to study transitions between spaces with distinct dimensions in the tensor model . 
 in the physical interpretation of the tensor model , a classical solution should be regarded as a background space , and fluctuations of tensor around such a classical solution as field fluctuations on a background space . 
 the main interest of the present study is whether such fluctuations can be identified with the general relativity or not . to check this , 
 the procedure carried out so far in @xcite assumes a correspondence between the tensor model around the gaussian backgrounds and the metric tensor field in the general relativity . 
 this correspondence enables one to compute the expectations about the tensor model from the general relativity . 
 if the expectations successfully agree with the numerical analysis of the tensor model , one may conclude that the general relativity is emergent around the gaussian backgrounds in the tensor model .    generalizing the gaussian backgrounds ( [ eq : cx ] ) in a coordinate invariant manner 
 , one can derive a natural correspondence between the metric tensor field in the general relativity and the tensor around the gaussian backgrounds as @xmath27,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 denotes the geometric distance between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . 
 the main assumption in this correspondence is that the low - lying long - wavelength fluctuations of the tensor around the gaussian backgrounds in the tensor model are exhausted by the metric field in the general relativity in the manner given in ( [ eq : correspondence ] ) . 
 it should be noted that this correspondence could be modified in higher orders of the fuzziness @xmath32 . 
 for example , there could exist corrections such as @xmath33 in ( [ eq : correspondence ] ) . 
 although it is certainly possible to directly use the correspondence ( [ eq : correspondence ] ) in the comparison between the tensor model and the general relativity , it is much more convenient to use a tensor with a smaller rank . 
 let me define @xmath34 small fluctuations @xmath35 around a classical solution @xmath36 induces fluctuations of @xmath37 as @xmath38    on the other hand , if one assumes a gaussian background and puts the assumed correspondence ( [ eq : correspondence ] ) into ( [ eq : tensordk ] ) , one obtains in the lowest order @xcite @xmath39 where the momentum basis is used , and @xmath40 is the fourier transform of @xmath41 , which describes the fluctuations of the metric tensor field around a flat background .    in later sections , 
 the analysis of eigenvectors gives @xmath35 of each fluctuation mode in the tensor model . 
 then one can compute @xmath42 of each mode by putting this @xmath35 and the background @xmath36 into ( [ eq : tensordk ] ) . 
 this @xmath42 obtained from the numerical analysis of the tensor model can be compared with the fluctuation modes of the metric tensor field in the general relativity through ( [ eq : metricdk ] ) . 
 another important fact which can be derived from ( [ eq : correspondence ] ) is that the measure which must be used in the analysis of the general relativity is uniquely determined from the measure ( [ eq : cmeasure ] ) in the tensor model . by putting the correspondence ( [ eq : correspondence ] ) into ( [ eq : cmeasure ] ) , one obtains the dewitt supermetric @xcite , @xmath43,\ ] ] in the lowest order @xcite . 
 in this section , i will study the small geometric fluctuations on @xmath19-dimensional flat tori in the general relativity to prepare for the comparison with the tensor model . 
 the important point in the analysis is that not all of the fluctuations of the metric tensor field are the fluctuations of geometry , because of the gauge symmetry ( local translation symmetry ) in the general relativity . 
 the relevant modes are only those which are normal to the gauge symmetry @xcite . 
 the measure to be used to define this normality condition is the dewitt supermetric given in ( [ eq : supermetric ] ) , since the numerical analysis of the tensor model uses the corresponding measure ( [ eq : cmeasure ] ) as shown in the following section .    for small fluctuations around a flat metric @xmath44 , the supermetric ( [ eq : supermetric ] ) is given by @xmath45.\ ] ] on the other hand , the infinitesimal gauge transformation on a flat background 
 is given in the momentum basis by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fourier transform of local translation vector .    at the vanishing momentum sector @xmath48 , as can be seen in ( [ eq : gaugemom ] ) , the gauge transformation is vacant , and all the components of the metric tensor are geometric degrees of freedom . by diagonalizing the supermetric ( [ eq : explicit ] ) , 
 the modes can be shown to be classified into the following three orthogonal classes : + ( i ) 1 conformal mode : @xmath49 . 
 + ( ii ) @xmath50 traceless diagonal modes : @xmath51 . 
 + ( iii ) @xmath52 off - diagonal modes .    at the nonvanishing momentum sector 
 , one may take the momentum to be in the direction @xmath53 with obvious generalization to the other directions . 
 then one can show that the modes normal to the gauge directions ( [ eq : gaugemom ] ) in the sense of the supermetric ( [ eq : explicit ] ) can be classified into the following three orthogonal classes : + ( i ) 1 diagonal mode : @xmath54 , @xmath55 for @xmath56 . 
 + ( ii ) @xmath57 traceless diagonal modes : @xmath58 , @xmath59 . + ( iii ) @xmath60 off - diagonal modes : @xmath61 for @xmath62 , @xmath63 . 
 @xmath42 for the geometric fluctuations of each mode in the general relativity can be computed by putting these results into ( [ eq : metricdk ] ) , and can be compared with the numerical analysis of the tensor model . 
 in this section , i will give a brief summary of the numerical analyses having been done so far on the small fluctuations around the gaussian backgrounds in the tensor model @xcite .    to unambiguously determine the spectra , the fluctuations must be normalized in a manner respecting the symmetries of the tensor model . 
 the tensor @xmath2 is symmetric under the exchanges of the indices as in ( [ eq : csym ] ) , and the tensor model has the orthogonal group symmetry ( [ eq : trans ] ) . 
 thus the independent components of fluctuations are normalized through ( [ eq : cmeasure ] ) as @xmath64\ ,   d c_{abc}\ , d c^{abc}=\sum_{(abc ) } d \tilde c_{(abc ) } \ , d \tilde c^{(abc)},\ ] ] where @xmath65 denotes an order - independent set of three indices , @xmath66}\,c_{abc}$ ] are the independent normalized components , and @xmath67 $ ] is the multiplicity defined by @xmath68=\left\ {   \begin{array}{ll } 1 & \hbox{for } a = b = c,\\ 3 & \hbox{for } a = b\neq c,\ b = c\neq a,\ c = a\neq b,\\ 6 & \hbox{all different}. \end{array } \right.\ ] ] then the coefficient matrix for the normalized fluctuations in the quadratic order around a background @xmath69 is given by @xmath70    the numerical analysis is carried out to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix ( [ eq : m ] ) , and then the results are compared with the general relativity through the procedure explained in the previous sections . 
 the genuine gaussian backgrounds presented in section [ sec : gauss ] can not be used as a background @xmath69 , because of their infinite number of degrees of freedom . 
 thus the actual numerical analyses have been done around the backgrounds of @xmath19-dimensional fuzzy flat tori . to describe such backgrounds of fuzzy flat tori in terms of @xmath2 , 
 the indices are assumed to take integer momenta bounded by a cut off , and the momentum conservation , @xmath71 , is assumed on account of the translational symmetry of such flat tori . 
 in fact , under these assumptions , one can numerically find classical solutions that resemble the genuine gaussian backgrounds @xcite . 
 using these numerical classical solutions as backgrounds , the coefficient matrices ( [ eq : m ] ) have been analyzed for dimensions @xmath72 in @xcite , and also for @xmath1 with an approximate method explained below @xcite . 
 the numerical analyses have shown that the spectra of the modes with long - wavelengths can roughly be classified into the following three classes . 
 + ( i ) the `` heavy '' modes with spectra of order 1 or larger . 
 + ( ii ) in @xmath73 , there exist low - lying modes with non - vanishing spectra of order much smaller than 1 . 
 + ( iii ) the zero modes with vanishing spectra . 
 + it is observed that the two classes ( i ) and ( ii ) are rather clearly separated so that they are located hierarchically . 
 the spectra in the class ( ii ) have been shown to form trajectories of the fourth power of momenta . moreover , 
 the spectral patterns and the mode profiles have been shown to be in good agreement with the geometric degrees of freedom in the general relativity discussed in section [ sec : gr ] , by comparing ( [ eq : tensordk ] ) computed numerically from the tensor model and ( [ eq : metricdk ] ) from the general relativity . 
 this shows that the general relativity is emergent around such backgrounds , and that the lowest effective actions are composed of curvature quadratic terms .    as for the class ( iii ) , by counting their numbers , these modes have been identified with the modes of the @xmath10 symmetry transformations in the tensor model spontaneously broken to the remaining symmetry @xmath74 of the torus backgrounds . 
 therefore these zero spectra are just the gauge modes of the tensor model . 
 the relation between these zero modes and the local gauge symmetry ( local translation symmetry ) of the general relativity has been studied in @xcite , which will be summarized in the following section .    in the approximate method used in @xcite , 
 the backgrounds @xmath69 in ( [ eq : m ] ) are not taken to be the classical solutions , but to be approximate ones , the gaussian backgrounds ( [ eq : cp ] ) with the modifications that the continuum @xmath75-functions are replaced with kronecker deltas , and that @xmath76 is taken in the range @xmath77 for the approximation to be good . in this approximation , it is easier to numerically analyze the cases with larger @xmath78 , and the agreement between the spectra in the class ( ii ) and the geometric degrees of freedom in the general relativity has been observed more clearly than without approximations . 
 part of the results for @xmath79 are shown in figures [ fig : dim2l10spec ] and [ fig : dim2l10 ] . especially , figure [ fig : dim2l10 ] shows very clearly the agreement of the mode profiles between the tensor model and the general relativity .

 the connection between the spontaneously broken @xmath10 symmetry and the local gauge symmetry ( local translation symmetry ) in the general relativity has been discussed in @xcite . in the paper , 
 the brst gauge fixing procedure has been applied to the @xmath86 symmetry of the tensor model , and the spectra of the ghost quadratic term have been studied numerically . 
 then the appearance of emergent massless ghost fields has been observed , and they have been identified with the reparametrization ghost fields coming from the brst gauge fixing of the general relativity . 
 let me start with the gauge fixing in the tensor model . 
 the off - shell nilpotent brst transformation in the tensor model is defined by @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the ghosts ( anti - ghosts ) , and the bosonic auxiliary variables @xcite , respectively . here 
 @xmath90 is the infinitesimal orthogonal transformation defined by @xmath91 where @xmath92 are the elements of the lie algebra @xmath93 in the vector representation , and @xmath94 is the structure constant defined by @xmath95=f^{ij}{}_k t^k$ ] . 
 now let me define a new dynamical variable @xmath25 by shifting the original variable @xmath96 by a background @xmath69 , @xmath97 then a natural gauge fixing plus faddeev - popov action is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the inner product associated with the measure ( [ eq : cmeasure ] ) . 
 the reason why this is natural is that the gauge fixing conditions ( @xmath100 ) only allow @xmath25 to be normal to the symmetry directions around the background @xmath69 . 
 this action contains the ghost quadratic term as @xmath101 figure [ fig : ghostspec ] shows the spectra of this ghost quadratic term and the ratio of the two trajectories obtained numerically for a gaussian background of @xmath79 flat torus .    , @xmath102 , @xmath103 . 
 the right figure shows the ratios of the two trajectories . 
 the horizontal axis is the momentum size @xmath104.,title=""fig:"",width=302 ] , @xmath102 , @xmath103 . 
 the right figure shows the ratios of the two trajectories . 
 the horizontal axis is the momentum size @xmath104.,title=""fig:"",width=302 ]    on the other hand , the off - shell nilpotent brst gauge transformation in the general relativity is given by @xmath105 corresponding to ( [ eq : shiftca ] ) , let me define a new dynamical field @xmath106 by shifting the metric by a flat background , @xmath107 . then , 
 an action naturally corresponding to ( [ eq : sgftensor ] ) is given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the inner product associated with the dewitt supermetric ( [ eq : supermetric ] ) . 
 in fact , the gauge fixing conditions in only allows @xmath106 to be normal to the infinitesimal gauge transformations of the flat background . 
 this action contains the ghost kinetic term as @xmath110+\cdots.\ ] ] this kinetic term contains the longitudinal ( @xmath111 ) and normal ( @xmath112 ) modes with spectra @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively . 
 in fact , the ratio of spectra @xmath115 agrees well with the numerical analysis of the tensor model as plotted in figure [ fig : ghostspec ] . 
 the mode profiles have also been checked as shown in figure [ fig : ghostprofile ] for @xmath79 . 
 the comparison of ghosts between the numerical analysis of the tensor model and the general relativity has also been done for @xmath116 , and clear agreement has been obtained .    , through @xmath42 in ( [ eq : tensordk ] ) and ( [ eq : metricdk ] ) .

 in a series of papers , i have studied the tensor model with actions which possess the gaussian backgrounds as their classical solutions . 
 these backgrounds represent fuzzy flat spaces with arbitrary dimensions , and the small fluctuations around them have been compared with the general relativity on flat backgrounds through numerical analyses . the numerical analyses for dimensions @xmath1 have shown that the long - wavelength low - lying fluctuation spectra are in one - to - one correspondence with the geometric fluctuations in the general relativity . 
 the analyses have also shown that part of the orthogonal symmetry of the tensor model spontaneously broken by the backgrounds corresponds to the local gauge symmetry ( local translational symmetry ) of the general relativity . 
 these results should be valid in all dimensions , because of the dimensional independence of the framework and of the way of analysis . 
 thus , the tensor model provides an interesting model of simultaneous emergence of space , the general relativity and its gauge symmetry of translation in general dimensions . 
 there seem to exist various questions about the results . 
 for example , the agreement between the modes in the tensor model and in the general relativity should be checked also for higher orders of fluctuations , although such higher order agreement is expected , because the general relativity ( possibly with modified actions ) is the only theory of symmetric rank - two tensor field with the gauge symmetry . 
 this will require more efficient numerical facility and/or technical developments . 
 another important question is the range of generality of the results , which have only been shown so far around the gaussian backgrounds in a few actions of examples . for the tensor model to be really interesting 
 , such emergence should be shown to be common phenomena in more general settings .

39,"the mystery of the dark energy / cosmological constant persists despite great efforts of particle physicists and cosmologists to find a convincing solution . since the famous article by s. weinberg 
 , it is well known that candidate models should not only explain the smallness of the cosmological constant , if it is somehow related to quantum gravity , but also what is called the coincidence problem i.e. why does dark energy become dominant quite late in the history of the universe ? 
 models inspired by string theory like 4-form gauge models can describe the smallness of the dark energy but not the coincidence problem . 
 anthropical models explain the latter problem but it is very difficult to find a natural and convincing particle physics model for them . 
 the same problem somehow exists for the alternative to a cosmological constant i.e. for quintessence models . 
 even if tracker solutions make the model not very sensitive to the initial conditions , some fine tuning of the slope of the potential is necessary . 
 it is also an open question if both inflation and quintessence behavior can be explained by the same field and if not , what is their relation and which type of particle physics can provide both of them specially in a natural way . 
 + here we suggest an alternative to a primordial quintessence field 
 . there are at least two motivations for the existence of a decaying dark matter ( ddm ) . 
 if r - parity in susy models is not strictly conserved , the lsp which is one of the best candidates of dm can decay to standard model particles . 
 violation of this symmetry is one of the many ways for providing neutrinos with very small mass and large mixing angle . 
 another motivation is the search for sources of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) . in this case 
 , ddm must be composed of ultra heavy particles with @xmath2 . in a recent work 
 we have shown that the lifetime of uhdm ( ultra heavy dark matter ) can be relatively short , i.e. @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the age of the universe ( astro - ph/0001137 ) . 
 + if a very small fraction of the mass of primary ddm particles changes to a scalar field with proper self interaction potential , the gradual condensation of this field at late time behaves like a quintessential matter . 
 the advantage of this model to others is that late time yield of this type of energy and its correlation with the amount of dark matter comes up naturally and the dominance of one with respect to the other at each epoch is automatically explained . 
 + in the present work we only study the plausibility of this model . 
 we postpone a more detailed study to elsewhere . 
 the natural choice of cosmological parameters for this model is an initial @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an early time in the history of the universe . for the result presented here 
 we consider it to be the time of decoupling of cmb photons ; @xmath7 . 
 the remnants of the decay else than quintessence field mainly consist of very energetic particles which will contribute to the yield of hot dark matter . 
 there is strict constraint on the amount of the latter from cosmological observations and the model must be consistent with observations . 
 however , one should not forget that massive particles like proton / ant - proton and even electrons become colder with the expansion of the universe and at some point they are not any more considered as hot . 
 in fact it can be shown that the whole effect on the equation of state of the universe is the reduction of the effective @xmath8 of the cosmological constant or a quintessence matter ( astro - ph/0002400 ) . 
 + we summarize our preliminary results in two following figures . 
 the first figure shows @xmath9 of the fit of quintessence models on the publicly available super - novae ia data . 
 models with @xmath0 fit the data better than @xmath10 . 
 +    the second figure shows the evolution of density of various types of matter from decoupling of cmb photons to today for a typical selection of parameters . 
 in one hand it shows that it is possible to obtain the present `` equivalent '' value of cosmological parameters without fine tuning of the suggested model . 
 another conclusion is that the appearance of cosmological parameters as measured in the local universe is very recent i.e. the measurement of cosmological parameters at high redshift permits to distinguish between this model and other quintessence models . 
 it is evident that the model presented here can not be believed before investigating many issues . 
 the first and one of the most important ones is the condensation of the scalar field . 
 one should determine the mass and the form of the potential and find the region of the parameter space that in a natural way can lead to a late condensation . 
 the other issue is that the value of @xmath8 for this type of matter can not be constant . 
 this can affect the evolution of halos , star formation rate , ionization of igm etc . and can be used to verify the model .","it is a known fact that a quintessence model with @xmath0 fits the publicly available super nova ( sn ) type ia data better than a model with cosmological constant or @xmath1 . 
 two types of models have this property : scalar fields with unconventional kinetic term and models with cosmological constant and a slowly decaying cold dark matter ( cdm ) . in this work 
 we investigate the possibility of replacing the cosmological constant in the latter models with gradual condensation of a scalar field produced during the decay of the cdm and present some preliminary results . 
 the advantage of this class of models to the ordinary quintessence is that the evolution of the dark energy and cdm are correlated and cosmological coincidence problem is solved or at least reduced to the fine tuning of the coupling between decaying cdm and quintessence field i.e the hierarchy problem . 
 here we show that for part of the parameter space these models are consistent with present estimation of cosmological parameters .    *

40,"since the mid 1970 s the existence of heavy hadronic molecules ( composed by a pair of heavy hadrons instead of a pair of heavy quarks ) has been theorized@xcite . 
 this assumption was made based on the similarities between the heavy meson - heavy antimeson system and the deuteron . 
 however , it was not until the discovery of the @xmath0@xcite by the belle collaboration , in 2003 , that the first experimental data that could fit into that molecular scheme was found . 
 since then , many other xyz states have been found , being the @xmath1 also natural candidates to have a molecular structure ..    besides , the @xmath2 limit of qcd simplifies the theory so a set of symmetries are induced . 
 probably , the most important symmetries induced in this limit are hqss , hfs , and hads . 
 we make use of them , along with the assumptions of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 to be heavy hadronic molecules , to obtain a family of heavy meson - doubly heavy baryons that could also be interpreted as triply heavy pentaquarks . 
 this proceeding is organized as follows . 
 first we briefly introduced our eft based on hqss and hfs that we will use in the analysis of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 . 
 second , we will discuss hads and its implications . 
 finally , our results will be shown in table [ tab : predictions ] . 
 in this work we are following the scheme described in @xcite where all sort of details can be found . at lowest order , hqss and hfs 
 impose that the dynamics of the model does not depend on either the mass or the spin of the heavy quark . taking this into account , the most general potential that describes the dynamics of the heavy meson - antimeson pair depends only in four low energy constants or counter - terms ( lecs ) , up to corrections of the order @xmath3 : @xmath4 tr\left[{h}^{(\bar{q } ) } \bar{h}^{(\bar{q } ) } \gamma^{\mu } \right ] + \\ \nonumber { } & & + \frac{c_{a}^{\lambda}}{4}~ tr\left[\bar{h}^{(q)}_{a } \lambda^{i}_{ab } { h}^{(q)}_{b } \gamma_{\mu } \right ] tr\left[{h}^{(\bar{q})}_{c } \lambda^{i}_{cd}\bar{h}^{(\bar{q})}_{d } 
 \gamma^{\mu } \right ]   + \\ 
 \nonumber { } & & + \frac { c_{b}}{4}~ tr\left[\bar{h}^{(q)}{h}^{(q ) } \gamma_{\mu } \gamma_{5 } \right ] tr\left[{h}^{(\bar{q } ) } \bar{h}^{(\bar{q } ) } \gamma^{\mu } \gamma_{5}\right ] + \\ & & +   \frac{c_{b}^{\lambda}}{4}~ tr\left[\bar{h}^{(q)}_{a } \lambda_{ab}^{j}{h}^{(q)}_{b } \gamma_{\mu } \gamma_{5 } \right ] tr\left[{h}^{(\bar{q})}_{c } \lambda^{j}_{cd } \bar{h}^{(\bar{q})}_{d } \gamma^{\mu } \gamma_{5}\right]\end{aligned}\ ] ] being @xmath5 the gell - mann matrices and @xmath6 the meson ( antimeson ) field in the charm sector ( and viceversa in the bottom sector ) . 
 moreover , the four lecs will be rewritten through a linear combination into @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 for notation . 
 these four lecs will be fitted to reproduce some experimental data in our scheme . in this framework 
 , bound states will be found by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation as they will appear as poles in the t - matrix : @xmath11 , and the ultraviolet divergences of the loop function are treated introducing a gaussian regulator in the propagator and in the potential such as :    @xmath12    these assumptions determine three linear combinations of the lecs , that is : @xmath13 and @xmath14 which in turn are determined by the @xmath0 ( for more details , see @xcite ) and @xmath15 by the @xmath16 resonances [ @xcite ] . 
 up to now , we have only established an eft that analyzes heavy meson - heavy antimeson molecules . in order to use this approach to different systems we will take advantage of the heavy antiquark - diquark symmetry ( hads ) . 
 this @xmath17 limit symmetry , first introduced by savage and wise , states that a heavy diquark behaves as a heavy antiquark up to corrections of the order @xmath18 , , being v the velocity of the heavy quarks .    furthermore , 
 since the dynamics of our eft only depends on the light degrees of freedom , that are the same than in the heavy meson - heavy antimeson system , we can make use of some racah algebra ( similar to @xcite ) to obtain the potentials in every possible channels , which are displayed in table [ tab : potentials ] . 
 the @xmath19 states are those where heavy quarks in the baryon are coupled to @xmath20 ( which is forbidden if the two quarks are the same because of the pauli s principle of exclusion ) 
 .    then we just have to solve the lippmann - schwinger equation in each channel using the lecs we have previously fitted to obtain the results of table [ tab : predictions ] . 
 the isoscalar states are related to the @xmath0 . 
 the isovector states are determined by the @xmath21 and the isovector component of the @xmath0 . 
 the sources of error in the analysis are : the masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath22 resonances , the ratio of the @xmath0 amplitude decays ( calculated in @xcite ) and the two eft expansions used in this work . the errors for hqss are taken to be @xmath23 in the charm ( bottom ) sector and @xmath24 $ ] in the charm ( charm - bottom ) [ bottom ] sector for hads . 
 then , an unique error is obtained by adding in quadratures all different sources . 
 as a summary , we can conclude that our analysis based on several qcd symmetries in the @xmath17 limit predicts the existence of several heavy meson - doubly heavy baryon molecular partners of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 . 
 this same effective field theory approach could also be extended to study doubly heavy baryon - double heavy antibaryon molecular systems in the future .

41,"we are poised on the threshold of unprecedented technical growth in wide - field time domain astronomy , where ground - based observations yield very precise measurements of stellar brightness from high - volume data streams . 
 so far , wide - field time - series surveys has been spearheaded by relatively small telescopes since they are supported by large field of view ( fov ) instruments operating with high duty cycle ( see @xcite for a summary of optical variability surveys ) . within the last decade , 
 the advent of large mosaic ccds has facilitated the coverage of large sky area even for large - aperture telescopes ( e.g. , mmt megacam : @xcite ; eso very large telescope omegacam : @xcite ; subaru suprime - cam : @xcite ; chft megacam : @xcite ; iptf : @xcite ) . 
 although these facilities are generally devoted to imaging surveys , researchers are attempting to utilize them for short- and long - term variability surveys with short - cadence exposures ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 such wide - field imaging systems have enabled us to observe hundred of thousands of target stars simultaneously and also to detect various variability phenomena . 
 a remarkable thing about these surveys is that the fraction of variable sources increases as the photometric precision of the survey improves . 
 for this reason , it is important to improve the accuracy in photometry . 
 another key issue in wide - field time - series photometry is the removal of temporal systematics from a single image frame or several consecutive image frames . 
 it has recently become known that systematic trends in time - series data can be different and localized within the image frame when the fov is large . such spatially localized patterns may be related to subtle point spread function ( psf ) differences and sky condition within the detector fov ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 as these patterns change in time , we can see how the temporal variations of systematic trends affect the brightness and shape of light curves directly . 
 the time - scale of systematic variation is sometimes comparable to short - term variability , such as transits or eclipses , and in some cases even long - term variability . 
 thus , it is often difficult to identify and characterize true variabilities .    in this paper 
 , we introduce a new photometry procedure , called multi - aperture indexing , which is suited to analyzing well - sampled wide - field images of non - crowded fields with a highly varying psf , such as those produced by wide - field mosaic imagers on large telescopes . 
 we apply this procedure to archival imaging data from the mmt / megacam transit survey of the open cluster m37 ( hartman et al . 
 2008a ) , demonstrating a substantial improvement over the existing photometry . 
 section 2 describes the mmt imaging database and identifies problems in the existing photometry which motivated the development of our new methods . 
 section 3 describes the multi - aperture photometry that utilize newly defined contamination index and carefully tuned calibration procedures , including the results of the basic tests to validate our approach . 
 section 4 gives an in - depth discussion about systematic trends in time - series data and suggests an efficient way for identifying , measuring , and removing spatio - temporal trends . 
 section 5 describes the effects of new calibration on period search , and we summarize our main results in the last section . 
 @xcite have conducted a study to find neptune - sized planets transiting solar - like stars in the rich open cluster m37 . 
 the observing strategy was carefully designed for a transiting planet search by several considerations ( e.g. , the reliability of exposure time per frame , the effects of pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations , and sensitivity of filter ) . 
 their work did not reveal any transiting planets , but it did provide a rare opportunity to explore photometric variability at relatively high temporal resolution with 3090 s. @xcite discovered 1430 new variable stars , including very short - period eclipsing binaries ( e.g. , v37 , v706 , v1160 ) and @xmath1 sct - type pulsating stars ( e.g. , v397 , v744 , v1412 ) . 
 we used the same data set on the open cluster m37 . 
 a detailed discussion of the observations , original data reduction , and light curve production is described in @xcite . 
 the data archive consists of approximately 5000 @xmath2-filter images taken over 24 nights with the wide - field mosaic imager ( megacam ) mounted at the @xmath3 cassegrain focus of the 6.5 m mmt telescope . 
 note that megacam is made up of 36 2048 @xmath4 4608 pixel ccd chips in a @xmath5 pattern , covering a 24@xmath6@xmath424@xmath6 fov @xcite . 
 this instrument has an unbinned pixel scale of @xmath7 , but it was used in @xmath8 binning mode for readout . 
 the observation logs are summarized in table 1 of @xcite . in brief , the @xmath9-band time - series observations were undertaken between 2005 december 21 and 2006 january 21 , with a median fwhm of @xmath10 arcsec . 
 exposure times are chosen to keep an @xmath11 mag star as close to the saturation limit , which is expressed as a function of seeing conditions . with an average seeing @xmath00@xmath12.89 on images , 
 the quality of the images is good to achieve high - precision light curves ( less than 1% rms value ) down to 20 . 
 in addition to the imaging data set , this database includes light curve data sets for a total of 23,790 sources detected in a co - added reference image . 
 theses light curves are obtained by the image subtraction technique using a modified version of isis software ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    as shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , however , the raw light curves from the original image subtraction procedures exhibit many unusual outliers , and more than @xmath015% of data get rejected by a simple filtering algorithm after cleaning procedures . in practice , brutal filtering that is often applied to remove outlying data points can result in the loss of vital data , with seriously negative impact to short - term variations such as flares and deep eclipses . 
 we also find that the image subtraction technique often resulted in measurement failures from several frames due to poor seeing or tracking problem . after removing these bad frames 
 , it leads to loss of additional @xmath05% data points from most light curves . in order to overcome this problem , 
 we have re - processed the entire image database with new photometric reduction procedures . 
 3-@xmath13 control limits ( dotted lines ) . 
 these light curves contain outlier points that significantly increase the rms scatter of the raw light curves . ] 
 we followed the standard ccd reduction procedures of the bias correction , overscan trimming , dark correction , and flat - fielding as described in @xcite . 
 the individual ccd frames were calibrated in iraf , using the mosaic data reduction package megared . 
 the first step is to correct the pixel - to - pixel zero - point differences that are usually described by the sum of a mean bias level and a bias structure . 
 as the bias frames were not separately taken during the time of the observations , the mean bias level was subtracted from each image extension using an overscan correction and so we can not remove any remaining bias structure from all overscan - subtracted data frames . according to description in matt ashby s megacam reduction guide , the bias structure can be very significant in some small regions such as the portions of the arrays close to the readout leads . 
 the dark currents are normally insignificant for megacam so that corrections are not needed even for long exposures . 
 the next step is to correct pixel - to - pixel variations in the sensitivity of the ccd ; we used the program ` domegacamflat2 ` . 
 this program determines the scaling factors to correct the gain difference between the two amplifiers of each chip by finding the mode in the quotient of pixels to the left and right of the amplifier boundary , and then flattens each of the frames with a master flat field frame . 
 it is worth mentioning that the sky conditions were rarely photometric during the observing run , with persistent light cirrus for most of the nights . 
 therefore it was only possible to obtain twilight sky flats on a handful of nights ( dome flats were not possible ) . 
 we removed bad pixels using the megacam bad pixel masks distributed with the megared package . 
 the values of bad pixels are replaced with interpolated value of the surrounding pixels using the iraf task ` fixpix ` . 
 the numerous single pixel events ( cosmic - rays ) were identified and removed using the lacosmic package @xcite . 
 the megacam data already have a rough world coordinates system ( wcs ) solution that is based on a single value of the telescope pointing . 
 to update these with a more precise solution , we applied astrometric correction to each ccd in the mosaic using the wcstools imwcs program @xcite . 
 the new solution is derived by minimizing the differences between the r.a . and decl . 
 positions of sources in a single ccd chip and their positions listed in the 2mass point source catalog @xcite . 
 the resulting astrometric accuracy is typically better than 0@xmath14.1 rms in both r.a . and decl . 
 typically , a point or extended source detection algorithm is applied to each frame independently and it always requires criteria for what should be regarded as a true detection . in obtaining the pixel coordinates for all objects in the m37 fields , this procedure often misses some objects when the detection threshold approaches the noise level . 
 also it needs a substantial effort to match the objects that are detected in only some of the frames . 
 our approach is as follows : a complete list of all objects is obtained from a co - added reference frame , and then the photometry is performed for each frame using the fixed positions of the sources detected on the reference . since the relative centroid positions of all objects are the same for all frames in the time series , we can easily place an aperture on each target and measure the flux even for the stars at the faint magnitude end . 
 we constructed the reference frame for each chip from the best seeing frames using the swarp software . 
 benefiting from a highly accurate astrometric calibration of input frames , we were able to improve the quality of co - added images . in the swarp implementation 
 , the pixels of each frame were resampled using the lanczos3 convolution kernel , then combined into the reference frame by taking a median or average . 
 after this was done , sources were detected and extracted on the reference frame using the sextractor software @xcite . 
 when configured with a lower detection threshold , sextractor extracts the number of spurious detections ( e.g. , diffraction spikes around bright stars , or outer features of bright galaxies ) . 
 these false detections were removed by careful visual inspection for each chip . 
 the final catalog contains a total of 30,294 objects including both point and extended sources . 
 prior to the photometry , the initial centroid coordinates of the target objects for each frame were computed by using the wcstools sky2xy routine @xcite . 
 the stored world coordinate system for each frame is used to convert the ( r.a . 
 , decl . ) coordinates from the master source catalog to the @xmath15 pixel locations . 
 however , actual positions of objects for each frame can be slightly moved from its original locations depending on the focus condition of instrument , seeing condition , and the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the individual observations . 
 these types of positioning errors ( i.e. , centroid noise ) will lead to the internal error for a photometric measurement that results from placement of the measuring aperture on the object being measured . 
 the situation gets worse for faint stars because the centroid position of them is itself subject to some uncertainty . the fractional error in the measured flux as a result of mis - centering 
 is given by:@xmath16 where @xmath17 is the positioning error , @xmath18 is the radius of aperture , @xmath13 is the profile width for a source with a gaussian psf , and total flux @xmath19 ( see appendix a in irwin et al . , 2007 for details ) . 
 this expression shows that if we set the aperture radius equal to the fwhm ( @xmath18=2.35-@xmath13 ) , even small differences in placement of the aperture ( e.g. , @xmath17=0.1-@xmath13 ) may increase the uncertainty in the flux measurements ( @xmath20 1 mmag ) . 
 thus , accurate centroid determination is important to achieve the high - precision photometry .    following the windowed centroid procedure in the sextractor 
 , a refined centroid of each object is calculated iteratively . 
 on average , the rms uncertainty in the coordinate transformation using the wcs information was @xmath21 pixels for the bright reference stars . 
 after the coordinate transformation from sky to @xmath22 , however , the centroid coordinates ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) are slightly misaligned from their actual ones ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) . 
 the refined centroid values ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) are used only if the maximum displacement is at least less than 1.5 pixels . 
 this condition prevents arbitrary shifting of a source centroid , especially for faint stars . 
 we estimated a local sky background by measuring the mode of the histogram of pixel values within a local annulus around each object , which is suitable choice for our uncrowded field ( less than @xmath01000 stars per chip ) . 
 this process is a combination of @xmath29-@xmath13 clipping and mode estimation . 
 the background histogram is clipped iteratively at @xmath303-@xmath13 around its median , and then the mode value is taken as : @xmath31 it represents the most probable sky value of a randomly chosen pixel in the sample of sky pixels @xcite . 
 for relatively crowded regions , we utilized a background map created by sextractor package using a mesh of @xmath32 pixels and a median filter box of @xmath33 pixels . 
 this map is used to confirm the properness of individual sky values from annulus estimates . 
 modern data reduction techniques aim to reach photon noise limit and minimize systematic effects . 
 for example , differential photometry technique can be achieved better than 1% precision for brighter stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the deconvolution - based photometry algorithm leads to the minimization of systematic effects in very crowded fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however 
 , conventional data reduction methods often fail to handle various artifacts in wide - field survey data . 
 we present below a new photometric reduction method for precise time - series photometry of non - crowded fields , without the need to involve complicated and cpu intensive process ( e.g. , psf fitting or difference image analysis ) . 
 our photometry is similar to standard aperture photometry , except in that we compute the flux in a sequence of several apertures and then determine the optimum aperture individually to each object at each epoch . 
 this multi - aperture photometry is an efficient way to determine the optimum aperture size that gives the maximum s / n for a flux measurement . the maximum s / n is not necessarily at the same aperture for all objects , and it can be obtained from a relatively small aperture @xcite . 
 this _ photometric _ 
 aperture is to achieve the optimal balance between flux loss and noises based on a relationship derived from the ccd equation ( see @xcite ) . 
 figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows how the optimum apertures vary with the stellar magnitude . 
 there is an obvious trend of decreasing aperture sizes with increasing magnitudes down to the faint magnitude limit in the example frame . 
 once we measure the flux of each object with the optimum aperture , we need to apply the aperture correction for small apertures . 
 the aperture correction terms are estimated from the growth curve analysis of selected isolated bright stars ( i.e. , reference stars ) . 
 the average curve - of - growth for each frame is calculated by measuring the difference in magnitude between different pairs of apertures ( up to 10 pixels aperture radius ) and then an automatic correction is applied to all objects for each photometric aperture . 
 the use of a common aperture correction for each ccd assumes that there is no variation in the correction across the ccd . 
 this flux correction method gives nearly the same brightness within the measurement uncertainties for all apertures . 
 any psf variation across the ccd causes systematic errors , however , and we deal with this in section 3.4 and section 4 .    100 thumbnail images of the target star . _ 
 middle panels _ : normalized s / n as a function of aperture size . _ bottom panels _ : aperture corrected magnitude as a function of aperture size . 
 the arrows represent the peak locations in the aperture - s / n diagram ( see text for details ) . ] 
 we performed the multi - aperture photometry based on the concentric aperture photometry algorithm in daophot package @xcite , using several circular apertures ( up to 10 pixels aperture radius ) with a fixed sky annulus from 35 to 45 pixels . 
 the initial results of multi - aperture photometry are stored in ascii - format photometry tables , including the date of the observations ( mjd ) , the pixel @xmath15 coordinates , the aperture - corrected magnitudes with errors for each aperture , the sky values and its errors . 
 figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the details of the multi - aperture photometry for one star at different epochs . in the former two epochs , the photometric apertures can be properly selected by the s / n cuts , while in the latter two epochs , s / n increases for lager apertures . 
 this unusual behavior is due to contamination by a moving object . 
 we automatically identifies similar unusual cases by the method of aperture indexing . 
 -filter light curve of same star ( id=10213 ) as shown in figure [ fig : fig3 ] . 
 bottom panels show the multi - aperture indexing scheme . 
 the @xmath34-axis is the aperture size and @xmath35 @xmath36-axis is the differential magnitude between pairs of apertures @xmath37(=@xmath38 ) . 
 we can see whether and at what aperture the differential magnitude ( solid lines ) begins to deviate from the model curve ( dashed lines ) for each epoch . ] 
 our multi - aperture indexing method is similar to the basic concept of the discrete curve - of - growth method @xcite . 
 each object is indexed based on the difference in aperture - corrected magnitude between pairs of apertures @xmath37(=@xmath38 ) with mean trend for stars of similar brightness ( see solid and dotted lines in bottom panels of figure [ fig : fig4 ] , respectively ) . 
 the aperture with a 10 pixel radius is used as the fixed reference aperture . 
 the mean trend is determined by computing the rms curve of the aperture correction values for all measured apertures , and used to evaluate whether magnitude at a given aperture significantly differs from the mean trend . 
 since the rms value depends on the chosen magnitude interval , all stars are divided into groups according to their brightness in the individual frames . 
 we determine the rms curve for each magnitude group using an iterative @xmath13-clipping until convergence is reached . 
 objects lying within @xmath303-@xmath13 of the model curve are indexed as contamination - free , and those above @xmath303-@xmath13 as a contaminated source . 
 figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows that multi - aperture indexing guides us to throw out some photometric measurements if they are discrepant from the mean trend . 
 this approach also gives us a chance to recover a measurement that would be otherwise thrown out . 
 the problematic aperture can be simply replaced by one of the smaller apertures if it is indexed as contamination - free . 
 this help us make a full use of the information offered by the data . 
 we present a new photometric calibration to convert the instrumental magnitudes onto the standard system , including a relative flux correction of the left and right half - region of each ccd chip . 
 as mentioned in the section 3.1 , mmt / megacam shows the temporal variations in the gain between two amplifiers on each ccd , as well as between ccds that are part of the same mosaic . 
 it may have been caused by unstable bias voltage of the ccd output drain which has a profound impact on the gain of the output amplifier . 
 the level of readout noise is also unstable between two amplifiers . to correct for this effect 
 , the photometric calibration needs to be performed individually for each amplifier region . 
 we use a sufficient number of ( pre - selected ) bright isolated stars as standard stars and compute the relative flux correction terms . 
 these terms were derived for each frame using the mean magnitude offset ( @xmath39 ) of standard stars ( @xmath40 ) with respect to corresponding magnitudes ( @xmath41 ) in the master frame chosen as an internal photometric reference    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the aperture - corrected instrumental magnitudes in other frames and @xmath44 is the photometric zero - points for the left- and right - side of each chip , respectively . to calculate the zero - points , we solve 
 a linear calibration relation of the form : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are standard magnitudes from the photometric catalog of m37 @xcite and @xmath48 is an airmass term . 
 the fit is performed iteratively using a sigma - clipping method . 
 figure [ fig : fig5 ] shows the difference in the magnitude offsets between the left- and right - side of each chip ( @xmath49 ) for the whole data set , which is within @xmath50 magnitude level for all 36 ccd chips . 
 the histograms are normalized by the total number of data frames @xmath51 and are described by a gaussian function with slightly different mean values and shapes ( dashed line ) . 
 we clearly see a significant variation in difference between a pair of magnitude offsets for all ccds .      the photometric calibration for wide - field imaging systems is also affected by position - dependent systematic errors due to a psf variation across the fov ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 we derive psf variations across the fov with the sextractor package . 
 the change of the psf shapes in the image plane is represented by spatial distribution of psf fwhm values for several bright stars , with parameters of ` class\_star ` @xmath52 0.9 , ` magerr\_auto ` @xmath53 0.01 mag , and ` flags ` = 0 ( i.e. , isolated point sources with no contamination ) . 
 note that the psf fwhm values are defined as the diameter of the disk that contains half of the object flux based on a circular gaussian kernel . 
 figure [ fig : fig6 ] presents the variation of the psf fwhm as a function of distance from the image center for various seeing conditions . for each quadrant , 
 the dashed lines represent the weighted spline approximation of the median value of each distance bin ( 1 arcmin ) . 
 the result shows that the psf fwhm varies significantly as a function of position on the single - epoch image frames and variations are at the level of @xmath010% to 20% ( @xmath54 ) across the fov . as the field distortion is not negligible from the center of field to its edges , 
 such variations limit the accuracy of stellar photometry .        to address this issue , we perform a 2d polynomial fitting technique . for each frame , the correction terms are described by a linear or quadratic polynomial depending on the position @xmath55 only . 
 @xmath56    where @xmath57 are the pixel coordinates of @xmath58 bright isolated stars , @xmath59 is the statistical weight in the fitting procedure , @xmath60 are the sets of polynomial coefficients for each aperture size , and @xmath61 are the difference in magnitude between the reference aperture and @xmath62 aperture , @xmath63 , at the position @xmath55 for each chip @xmath64 . 
 we derived the optimal parameter values from a nonlinear least - squares fit using the levenberg 
 marquardt algorithm and automatic differentiation , and choose between two models that best fit the data . 
 figure [ fig : fig7 ] shows the field - dependent magnitude offsets and the distortion correction by 2d polynomial fitting method for one example mosaic ccd . for the outer and the central region of the mosaic , we compare the magnitude offsets between the reference aperture and the relatively smaller apertures as a function of @xmath55 coordinates . here 
 @xmath34-axis is in the declination direction and @xmath36-axis is opposite to the right ascension direction . 
 we find that the magnitude difference depends on position @xmath15 and is most discrepant in the outer part of the fov . 
 this effect is usually more significant in the @xmath36-direction than in the @xmath34-direction , especially for the case of aperture photometry performed with small apertures . 
 the correction for field - dependent psf variation reduces the initial @xmath010% variation ( gray lines ) to less than @xmath01% ( black lines ) .    . 
 ]        we compare the photometric performance of the re - calibrated light curves with the non - de - trended archival light curves by means of the two representative measures : ( i ) the rms photometric precision @xmath65 , and ( ii ) the data recovery rate @xmath66 . 
 the former is defined as the standard deviation of light curves around the mean value as a function of @xmath46 magnitude : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of data points in each light curve , @xmath69 is the observed magnitude , and @xmath70 is the mean magnitude of the object @xmath71 , and the latter refers to the number of _ analyzed _ data frames normalized by the total number of observed data frames @xmath58 for each object . in typical cases , the data recovery rate should be near unity in the bright magnitude regime and decreases with magnitude for fainter objects . for comparison , we decided to select light curve samples which show either no significant variability or seeing - correlated variations induced by image blending . 
 we remove all known variable stars from the sample list based on a new catalog of variable stars in m37 field ( s .- w . 
 chang et al . 
 2015 , hereafter paper ii ) . to remove the light curves of blended objects 
 , we use an empirical statistical technique to quantify the level of blending by looking for seeing - correlated shifts of the object from its median magnitude @xcite . 
 @xmath72 where @xmath73 for light curve points @xmath69 with uncertainties @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the same statistic measured with respect to a fourth order polynomial in fwhm fitted to the data . 
 we adopt the value @xmath76 for the selecting light curves with no blending . 
 the last selection criterion is that the light curves must exit both in the archive and our database .    in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : fig8 ] and figure [ fig : fig9 ] , we plot the rms photometric precision of light curves for the two megacam ccd chips in the outer ( ccd 1 ) and central ( ccd 21 ) part of the fov , respectively . 
 the black points show the rms values of the re - calibrated light curves , while the gray points are for the raw and filtered light curves in archive . 
 the first impression from this comparison is that the typical rms scatter is overestimated from the raw light curves because of many outliers in the photometric data ( bottom left panels ) . for the better results , 
 these light curves were filtered out in two steps : ( i ) clipping 5-@xmath13 outliers from each light curve and ( ii ) removing every data points that are outliers in a large number of light curves @xcite . in the second step , 
 the outlier candidates are estimated by choosing a cutoff value for each ccd chip . 
 the cutoff value is defined as the fraction of light curves for which a given image is a 3-@xmath13 outlier . 
 this filtering was applied to remove bad measurements due to image artifacts or poor conditions , which were previously thought to be unrecoverable , but resulting data loss is up to 20% of the total number of data points ( bottom right panels ) . as shown in the top panels of the two figures , 
 the data recovery rate for the re - calibrated light curves is close to 100@xmath77 over a wide range of magnitude and it appears to be more complete compared with the raw ( top left panels ) and filtered ( top right panels ) light curves . at bright magnitudes ( @xmath78 ) 
 the data recovery rate does not reach 100@xmath77 because the exposure time was chosen to be saturated at a magnitude of @xmath11 . 
 this comparison proves that our approach is a powerful strategy for improving overall photometric accuracy without the need to throw out many outlier data points . 
 finally , we compare the light curves themselves for selected variable stars between the archive and our own . 
 this comparison serves to illustrate how the photometric precision and data recovery rate of the time - series data affect the ability to address a variety of variability characteristics . 
 figure [ fig : fig10 ] shows a direct comparison with the filtered light curves ( top panels ) and our re - calibrated light curves ( bottom panels ) for four variable stars . 
 it is shown that our method recovers more data points ( black ) from the same data set of images . 
 and @xmath36 coordinates , respectively , for selected ccd chips . 
 the filled squares are relatively bright stars with @xmath79 mag , while the open squares are stars with @xmath80 mag . ]      in order to further investigate possible systematics in our approach , we conducted psf - fitting photometry with daophot ii and allstar @xcite . 
 for each mosaic frame , we select bright , isolated , and unsaturated stars to make the psf model varying quadratically with @xmath55 coordinates . 
 after psf modeling , we run allstar to perform iterative psf photometry of all detected sources in the frame with initial centroids set to the same values used for our own photometry . 
 we then calculated aperture corrections using the package daogrow @xcite after subtraction of all but psf stars , which creates aperture growth curves for each frame and then integrates them out to infinity to obtain a total magnitude for each psf star . 
 the final step is to convert the instrumental magnitudes into the standard photometric system . for each frame , the initial zero - point correction is applied by correcting the magnitude offset with respect to the master frame . 
 this places photometry for all frames on a common instrumental system . 
 following the same procedure in section 3.3 , the photometric calibration is performed individually for each amplifier region . 
 figure [ fig : fig11 ] shows the residual magnitudes and sky values between our multi - aperture photometry and the psf - fitting photometry as a function of position in the selected ccd chips . 
 there are no position - dependent trends in the magnitude residuals . for the brighter stars with @xmath79 mag , 
 the rms magnitude difference between the two methods is very small ( @xmath81 = @xmath82 and @xmath83 = @xmath84 , respectively ) , while for the relatively faint stars the rms difference is somewhat larger ( @xmath81 = @xmath85 and @xmath83 = @xmath86 , respectively ) . 
 the results of this example indicate that we can reliably correct for the psf variations by our calibration procedures 
 . meanwhile , our sky values are slightly higher than the allstar sky values , but not to the degree that can seriously affect photometric measurements .

 the arrows indicate the three different magnitude levels from bright to faint in our sample shown in the right panels . 
 note that the variable object ids are taken from the new variable catalog of the m37 ( see paper ii ) . ] 
 figure [ fig : fig12 ] shows a comparison of the rms dispersion of the light curves obtained with our photometry with respect to the that of the psf - fitting photometry in the central region of the open cluster m37 . 
 we only compare the light curves of non - blended objects as described in section 3.5 . 
 our multi - aperture photometry does not reach the same level of precision as psf - fitting photometry for the faintest stars , while the psf - fitting approach results in poorer photometry for bright stars . 
 as shown in the right panels of figure [ fig : fig12 ] , it is clear that our photometry tend to have smaller measurement errors with respect to the psf photometry for the bright stars . 
 -axis indicate the corresponding timestamps in each frame . 
 the deviations from the mean value , @xmath87 , are less than @xmath300.01 mag level ( with a rms values of 0.0021 , 0.0025 , and 0.0033 mag from the top panel down ) . 
 these stars show a similar pattern of light variations over the observation span . ] 
 from a visual inspection of the re - calibrated light curves in the same ccd chip , we found that some light curves tend to have the same pattern of variations over the observation span ( figure [ fig : fig13 ] ) . 
 this kind of systematic variation ( i.e. , _ trend _ ) is often noticed in other studies . 
 for example , the importance of minimizing known ( or unknown ) systematics have been recognized by several exo - planet surveys because planet detection performance can be easily damaged by them ( e.g.,@xcite ) . 
 also space - based time - series data ( e.g. , corot and kepler ) are no exception to this behavior although it is completely free from systematics caused by the turbulent atmosphere . 
 most of the raw light curves are affected by a secular ( or a sudden ) variation of flux without any obvious physical reason @xcite .    in order to check the properties of temporal systematics 
 , we examined the correlation coefficients as measure of similarity between two light curves @xmath47 and @xmath71 obtained from a single ccd chip ( ccd 1 ) . 
 @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the flux of each star at time @xmath90 , @xmath58 is the total number of measurements , @xmath91 is the mean flux of each star , and @xmath13 is the standard deviation of @xmath89 . 
 this comparison is a point - by - point comparison and is done for every pair of light curves in the data set . 
 the resultant similarity matrix can be used to identify correlated pairs of light curves and to determine which light curve is least like all other light curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 after that , we selected stars showing most systematics based on a hierarchical clustering method with the correlation coefficients ( see @xcite , for more details ) . 
 figure [ fig : fig14 ] represents spatial distribution of the most prominent trend groups on the ccd plane ( top panel ) and its strongly correlated features determined by the weighted sum of normalized light curves ( bottom panel ) . 
 there are two interesting features in this figure : the first one is that each trend covers only a certain part of the sky area and the second one is that some portions of neighboring trends show different variation patterns even at the same moment in time ( shaded gray region in the figure ) . in particular , we found an anti - correlated variation for the trends between the group 1 ( @xmath92 ) and the group 2 ( @xmath93 ) , so we might expect to find possible noise sources that are responsible for these discrepancies . 
 why the trends are different and localized within a single ccd frame is a subject of further study , but it is probably related to subtle changes in point spread function and sky condition within the detector fov .     and @xmath94 ) of stars . 
 the numbers on the @xmath34-axis indicate the corresponding timestamps between the frame 1 and the frame 400 . from the top to bottom , the panels show the average difference of trend , flux concentrations in which we applied a @xmath95 mag shift to the @xmath96 value , sky level , and psf fwhm value between the two groups . ]    , for the original multi - aperture magnitude measurements as a function of aperture size , which is marked with a gray dots in all panels . 
 a positive @xmath97 indicates that the photometric measurements with the corresponding aperture size , @xmath98 , are brighter than those of reference aperture @xmath99 , while a negative @xmath97 indicates vise versa . 
 the dashed lines are the rms model profiles introduced in section 3.2.2 . 
 there is a noticeable distinction between the group 1 ( _ top panels _ ) and group 2 ( _ bottom panels _ ) when looked at different concentration levels . 
 but the trends are not fully explained by the difference patterns in @xmath97 because those correlated variations become small after the correction for the psf variation ( black dots ) . ]    for these two groups , we consider a possible causal relationship between the systematic trends and average object / image properties . 
 figure [ fig : fig15 ] shows the differences in trend , differential magnitudes , sky level , and psf fwhm between the two groups , respectively . in the top panel , we plot the magnitude difference in trends , which shows variations in the range of @xmath50 mag . 
 we suspect that this may be due to the different concentration of star light between these two groups 
 . it can be checked by using the magnitude difference @xmath100 , where @xmath99 and @xmath98 are the reference aperture and the relatively small aperture , respectively . 
 in fact , we already know that there is a magnitude variation in @xmath37 depend on the aperture size due to the field - dependent psf variation ( see section 3.4 ) . for example , figure [ fig : fig16 ] shows the response of multi - aperture photometry for the two groups of stars at one epoch ( mjd = 53726.14817 ) before and after applying the distortion corrections . 
 although the magnitude variation between the group 1 and the group 2 seems to have different behavior as a function of aperture size ( gray points ) , it is negligible after the removal of the psf variation ( black points ) . 
 we also check that the possible contribution of sky level ( @xmath101 ) and psf fwhm differences ( @xmath102 ) to the systematic trends on the re - calibrated light curves . as mentioned by @xcite , sky over - subtraction 
 may lead to the systematic trends as a function of the psf fwhm , the amplitude of which increase for fainter stars . 
 the third and forth panels of figure [ fig : fig15 ] show the variation of the mean @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively . in our case , however , the form and amplitude of trends seem independent of sky level and psf fwhm . 
 some other possible sources that may contribute to the observed systematic trends include : higher order variations in the psf shape beyond just the fwhm ; cross - talk from other amplifiers , or ghosts from bright stars undergoing multiple reflections within the optics ; non - uniform variations in the gain ; and unmodeled temporal atmospheric variations that are dominated by rayleigh scattering , molecular absorption by ozone and water vapor , and aerosol scattering @xcite . 
 while we find a clear presence of trends that should be removed , we are not able to identify their exact cause .      in order to reduce systematic effects in photometric time - series data , several methods were introduced ( e.g. , tfa : @xcite ; sys - rem : @xcite ; pdt : @xcite ; cda : @xcite ; pdc : @xcite ) . 
 all of these algorithms share a common advantage that they work without any prior knowledge of the systematic effects . 
 we use the pdt algorithm , which has been designed to detect and remove spatially localized patterns . by default 
 , this algorithm works with a set of light curves that contain the same number of data points distributed in the same series of epoch . in many cases , however , 
 missing data occur when no photometric measurements are available for some stars in a given observed frame . 
 these missing data can be simply replaced by means , medians , or the values from the interpolation of adjacent data points in each light curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 although using the replaced value is the easiest way to reconstruct the light curve to be analyzed , it is not appropriate if the time separation between two subsequent observations is too large . 
 instead we use more straightforward approach by applying the pdt algorithm in two separate steps : ( i ) we construct the master trends from the subset of bright stars , and ( ii ) de - trend light curves of all stars with most similar master trend and matching time line .    -axis indicate the corresponding timestamps between the frame 1 and the frame 2000 . 
 the @xmath36-axis is @xmath46-filter magnitude ( normalized by its mean value ) . 
 while the morphology of the two light curves in the left panels appear to be variable stars of some kind , these turn out to be non - variable after applying the photometric de - trending method . in the case of the right panels , 
 all true variabilities are preserved from the raw light curves . from upper left 
 to lower right : id=10032 , id=10039 , id=170088 , and id=170108 . ] 
 we briefly describe the main procedure of our de - trending process following the algorithm derived by @xcite . 
 we first select the template light curves from bright stars that show the highest correlation in the light - curve features . 
 the total length of template light curves should be long enough to cover the whole time span of observations . in this step , we take a sequence of data points , @xmath103 as the reference time line . using the correlation matrix calculated from equation ( 7 ) , we extract all subset of light curves that show spatio - temporally correlated features ( i.e. , clusters ) . 
 each cluster is determined by hierarchical tree clustering algorithm based on the degree of similarity . 
 next , we obtain master trends @xmath104 for each cluster by weighted average of the normalized differential light curves , @xmath105 : @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the total number of light curves in each cluster @xmath64 , @xmath110 is mean value of _ i light curve , and @xmath111 is the standard deviation of @xmath105 . after determining the master trends , we de - trend the light curves of all stars with matching master trend and time line . 
 we adjust the temporal sequence of measurements for the master trends @xmath112 by that of individual light curves to be de - trended @xmath113 . because each light curve is assumed as a linear combination of master trends and noise 
 , we can determine the optimal solution by minimizing the residual between the master trends and the light curve : @xmath114 @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the total number of master trends and @xmath117 are free parameters to be determined by means of minimization of noise term @xmath118 . 
 _    figure [ fig : fig17 ] shows examples of our light curves before and after removing the systematic trends . 
 the algorithm we used for de - trending removes only the systematic variations that are shared by light curves of stars in the adjacent sky regions ( left panels ) , while all kinds of true variabilities are preserved ( right panels ) . 
 ( indicated by arrow ) . 
 the phased diagram of this candidate frequency is shown in the low - right panel . 
 we see that the model fits well the overall pulsating variability ( red line ) . ]    , but the subfigure of low - right panel is 200@xmath4200 thumbnail image of the target star . 
 there is no potential sources of contamination to hamper the interpretation of the power spectrum . ] 
 the usefulness of our photometry is tested for a set of variable stars . 
 we immediately find abundant cases of improvements in the following three aspects : ( i ) refinement of the derived period , ( ii ) detection of a new significant peak in the periodogram , and ( iii ) separation of non - variable candidates where systematics in the light curves were mistaken for true variability . 
 for each case , we compare light curves and power spectra for archival data and our data . 
 for the first example , we show that a new photometric measurement and calibration allowed us to derive a much improved refinement of the light curves and of the derived periods ( figure [ fig : fig18 ] ) . we performed a lomb - scargle ( l - s : @xcite ) search of both archival and new light curves for periodic variable star ( v427 ) . 
 the light curves are folded by the best - fit period of 5.4615 and 4.4158 days , respectively . 
 we also calculated the false - alarm probability ( @xmath119 fap ) for each peak and its signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) : @xmath119 fap@xmath120 = @xmath121 , s / n@xmath120 = 43.2 for the archival data and @xmath119 fap@xmath122 = @xmath123 , s / n@xmath122 = 84.5 for the new data . 
 since we can get better estimation with much lowered minimum fap value , our new period is the most likely result . in the bottom panels , 
 the resulting amplitude spectrum was calculated with ` period04 ` package . 
 since the archival data is more noisy than the new one , it is rather complicated to interpret the peaks of its power spectrum .    for the second example , we show the newly discovered low - amplitude pulsating variable star ( figure [ fig : fig19 ] ) . 
 we used the ` period04 ` package to find multiple pulsation periods . 
 the whole process of identifying , fitting , and pre - whitening successive frequencies was repeated until no significant frequencies were found . 
 we adopt a conservative approach in selecting the statistical significant peaks from the amplitude spectrum 
 . a s / n amplitude ratio of 4.0 is a good criterion for independent frequencies , equivalent to 99.9% certainty of variability @xcite . 
 while no clear periodicity was found in the archive data , our amplitude spectrum shows a clear excess of power centered at 22.3979 days@xmath124 with peak amplitudes of about 1 mmag ( s / n@xmath122 = 9.02 ) . 
 the last example is the opposite case of the second . 
 figure [ fig : fig20 ] shows that this object is unlikely to be a variable source because there is no evidence for any significant peaks , which indicates that the variations are mostly noise . 
 extensive study on variabilities will be presented in paper ii . 
 in this paper , we introduce a new time - series photometry with multi - aperture indexing and spatio - temporal de - trending techniques , together with complex corrections to minimize instrumental biases . 
 we used the archival , high - temporal time - series data from one - month long mmt / megacam transit survey program . 
 the re - calibration of the archival data has made several improvements as follows : ( i ) the photometric information derived from the multi - aperture indexing measurements is useful to obtain the best s / n measurement , but also to diagnose whether or not the targets are contaminated ; ( ii ) the resulting light curves utilize nearly 100% of available data and reach precisions down to sub mmag level at the bright magnitude end without the need to throw out many outlier data points , which makes it possible to preserve data points that show intrinsic sudden variations such as flare events ; ( iii ) corrections for position - dependent psf variations and de - trending of spatio - temporal systematic trends improve the quality of light curves ; and ( iv ) new photometry enables us to determine the variability nature and period estimate more accurately .    while this study deals with a particular set of data from mmt 
 , we find our approach has a potential for other wide - field time - series observations . 
 multi - aperture indexing measurement is a powerful tool in isolating and even correcting various contaminations . 
 spatio - temporal de - trending is also very useful in removing systematics caused by psf variation and even non - uniform extinction of thin clouds across the fov .

42,"factorization of numbers into their prime factors is a hard non - polynomial problem for classical computers . 
 it was shor @xcite who proposed a quantum algorithm which can solve the problem of factorization of numbers on a quantum computer with a tremendous speedup as compared to a classical computer . 
 a practical demonstration of shor s algorithm has been carried out by factorizing the integer 15 @xcite , using nuclear magnetic resonance . 
 however , quantum computers capable of implementing shor s algorithm for larger numbers have not been developed yet . 
 several approaches to factorize numbers based on interference of multiple quantum paths have been proposed dowling , summhammer , merkel2006,mahesh , mehring , gilowski2008,bigourd2008,sadgrove2008,stefanak . 
 those schemes do not use quantum entanglement and do not capitalize on quantum parallelism . as a consequence , 
 these schemes scale exponentially with the number of digits of the factorized number . 
 this is in contrast to shor s algorithm which requires only a polynomial number of operations . nevertheless , 
 if the interference is implemented in a suitable way in a system , which does the factorization , then one can benefit because nature plays the role of a computer . 
 as was pointed out by jones @xcite the proposed techniques for factorization based on gauss sums @xcite unfortunately do not provide useful methods to factorize numbers , because a precalculation of the factors is needed for the experiment . in spite of that 
 , gauss sums would be useful if it is possible to avoid explicit precalculation stages of the algorithms . 
 physical systems that can implement the gauss sums must be described by complex numbers . in the present paper 
 we investigate how truncated fourier sum and its generalizations , like truncated gauss , kummer and exponential sums , could emerge from superposition of several oscillations . 
 those sums can be used successfully to factorize numbers . due to the wide use of interferences and beats in optics 
 , we shall keep our consideration close to optics and our examples are in wave optics too . 
 however , the proposed implementation can be extended to virtually any physical system where superposition among several different oscillations appear , from the mechanical pendulum with several degrees of freedom , through the atomic and solid state systems and their analogs in quantum mechanics . 
 in order to find the factors of a given number @xmath0 we use the following truncated sum : @xmath1where @xmath2 is an integer and @xmath3 is the number of terms in the sum . 
 the argument @xmath4 scans through all integers between @xmath5 and @xmath6 for possible factors . 
 the capability of the sum of eq . 
 ( [ truncated sum ] ) to factor numbers originate from the fact that for an integer factor @xmath7 of @xmath0 with @xmath8 , all phases in @xmath9 are integer multiples of @xmath10 . 
 consequently , the terms add up constructively and yield @xmath11 . 
 when @xmath4 is not a factor , the phases oscillate rapidly with @xmath12 , and @xmath9 takes on small values . in this interference pattern , larger truncation parameter @xmath3 leads to better convergency . in principle , 
 already the first several terms of the sum are sufficient to discriminate factors from non - factors . 
 depending on the coefficient @xmath2 in eq.([truncated sum ] ) we distinguish several important cases :    [ fourier , gauss and kummer ] @xmath13    the use of quadratic phases to factor numbers ( gauss sum ) has the advantage of fewer terms needed in the sum to distinguish factors from non - factors compared to the linear phase ( fourier sum ) , which is because of high quasi - randomness for the quadratic phase @xcite . in the very same way 
 the kummer sum , and sums with nonlinear phases of higher order , has an advantage compared to the gauss sum @xcite . 
 now we consider a system with @xmath3 different oscillation modes , with frequencies @xmath14 , phases @xmath15 and amplitudes @xmath16    @xmath17    using the superposition principle we can write the resulting oscillation as the sum of all oscillations : @xmath18 in the sum of eq . 
 ( [ result oscilation ] ) we can vary the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the time @xmath20 . in the next several sections we will show how truncated fourier , gauss , kummer and exponential sums could emerge when we fix three of the parameters for all oscillations , while changing the fourth parameter . 
 first we consider the case when the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath14 , @xmath21 are equal for all oscillations in eq . 
 ( [ individual oscillation ] ) @xmath22thus the only parameter that is left not fixed in eq . 
 ( [ individual oscillation ] ) is the time @xmath20 . 
 this can be easily realized in optics by interferometry , where the individual oscillations describe the electric field for the different arms of the interferometer as shown in fig.[four arms ] .    from fig . 
 [ four arms ] and eq . 
 ( [ result oscilation ] ) we see that we have the following sums of electric fields in the detector@xmath23where @xmath24 is the phase accumulated in the @xmath12 arm of the interferometer due to the difference in travel time through each arm . 
 suppose that each arm of the interferometer is with length @xmath25 the wave length of the light that we use in vacuum is @xmath26 and the corresponding frequency is @xmath27 , let the index of refraction in each arm of the interferometer is different and is denoted as @xmath28 . 
 then the phase @xmath24 for the beam that travels through the @xmath12-th arm of the interferometer is given as@xmath29here @xmath30 is the time that light travel in the @xmath12-th arm of the interferometer to pass length @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the speed of light in that arm . 
 the refraction index in arm @xmath12 of the interferometer is @xmath33thus @xmath34then the electric filed in the detector is @xmath35now if the index of reflection in the @xmath12 arm of the interferometer is @xmath36then @xmath37the detector registers the intensity,@xmath38various @xmath2 gives us a different type of truncated sum ( see eq . 
 ( fourier , gauss and kummer ) ) . 
 the number that we want to factorize is @xmath39 the trial factors are @xmath26 . 
 each time when the trial factor @xmath26 is a factor of @xmath40 we will observe a maximum signal in the detector . 
 the number of the terms in the sum can be controlled by doubling the elements in the interferometer fig . 
 [ four arms ] . 
 the numbers that could be factorized in this way are of order @xmath41 . 
 now we consider a train of pulses , where the delay of the @xmath12 pulse compared to first pulse is given as@xmath42here @xmath12 takes the values @xmath43 , while @xmath44 can be set as a unit of time . 
 we consider the case when all pulses have equal amplitudes @xmath45 and equal frequencies @xmath46 . 
 then the electric field for the @xmath12 pulse is given by eq . 
 ( [ individual oscillation ] ) and reads @xmath47let us make a different path way for every pulse in such a way that all pulses hit the same detector at the same time , this is equivalent to make @xmath48 at the place where all pulses collides . 
 then the intensity that the detector registers is a result from the superposition among all electric fields , e.g the sum from eq . 
 ( [ result oscilation]):@xmath49where @xmath50 . if one chooses the frequency @xmath51 as the number that we want to factorize ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath52 as a trail factor ( @xmath4 ) , then eq.([intensity ] ) reduces to the sum from eq . 
 ( truncated sum ) . 
 if we now consider a system that exhibits several oscillations with the same amplitude @xmath53 and the same initial phases ( @xmath54 ) , but with different frequencies @xmath14 , then the individual oscillations ( individual oscillation ) are described by @xmath55the resulting oscillation ( [ result oscilation ] ) is @xmath56where @xmath57 . 
 we will observe beats when @xmath58 is a integer which could be used to find the factors of the number @xmath59 . 
 one physical realization of the above idea could be a light with several high - harmonic generated frequencies brabec2000,gavrila1992 , chosen in the way that they present for example the odd terms in the fourier sum : @xmath60then in the detector the time of the detection play the role of the test factors and whenever there is a beat we observe a maximum of the signal , thus this time is a real factor . 
 the last parameter that we can vary in eq . 
 ( [ individual oscillation ] ) is the amplitude of the individual oscillation . 
 for example if we work with laser light we can use the different polarization orientations of the electric field . 
 the electric field is a vector in the polarization plane , which can be described by complex electrical field . 
 let us consider the case when we have a linearly polarized light pulse , which is split in several parts and each part passes different pathways through faraday cells as shown in fig . 
 [ faraday cells ] .    applying different faraday rotation angles 
 @xmath15 on each pathway and collecting all of the light at the same place ( at the detector ) the resulting electric field is the superposition:@xmath61where @xmath53 is the electrical field amplitude of the initial beam . 
 the relation between the angle of polarization rotation due to the faraday effect @xmath15 and the magnetic field @xmath62 in a diamagnetic material @xcite is    @xmath63    where @xmath31 is the length of each pathway and @xmath64 is the verdet constant for the material @xcite . for the amplitude of the resulted electric field we have:@xmath65if we now have a magnetic field @xmath62 for the @xmath12-th faraday cell , which is given as : @xmath66then 
 the intensity in the detector is @xmath67here the number that we want to factorize is @xmath39 the trial factors are @xmath68 . 
 we have shown how the factorization algorithm based on truncated fourier , gauss , kummer or exponential sums emerges naturally from superpositions of classical light waves . 
 we have proposed a number of simple implementations in optics . 
 these implementations can be extended to virtually any physical system where superpositions of several different oscillations appear . 
 the factorization algorithms discussed in this paper are classical algorithms and thus their complexity scales exponentially with the number of digits . 
 if an extension of this algorithm exists in entangled quantum systems , then a quantum computing parallelism would be involved with an exponential speedup of factorization . 
 the present solutions therefore could be the first step to an alternative quantum factorization algorithm to the famous shor algorithm .

43,"suppose we are trying to learn a difficult classification problem : for example determining whether the given image contains a human face , or whether the mri image shows a malignant tumor , etc . 
 we may first try to train a simple model such as a small neural network . 
 if that fails , we may move on to other , potentially more complex , methods of classification such as support vector machines with different kernels , techniques to apply certain transformations to the data first , etc . 
 conventional statistical learning theory attempts to bound the number of samples needed to learn to a specified level of accuracy for each of the above models ( e.g.  neural networks , support vector machines ) . 
 specifically , it is enough to bound the vc - dimension of the learning model to determine the number of samples to use  @xcite . 
 however , if we allow ourselves to change the model , then the vc - dimension of the overall learning algorithm is not finite , and much of statistical learning theory does not directly apply .    accepting that much of the time the complexity of the model can not be a priori bounded , structural risk minimization  @xcite explicitly considers a hierarchy of increasingly complex models . 
 an alternative approach , and one we follow in this paper , is simply to consider a single learning model that includes all possible classification methods . 
 we consider the unrestricted learning model consisting of all computable classifiers . 
 since the vc - dimension is clearly infinite , there are no uniform bounds ( independent of the distribution and the target concept ) on the number of samples needed to learn accurately  @xcite . 
 yet we still want to guarantee a desired level of accuracy . rather than deciding on the number of samples a priori 
 , it is natural to allow the learning algorithm to decide when it has seen sufficiently many labeled samples based on the training samples seen up to now and their labels . since the above learning model includes any practical classification scheme , we term it universal ( pac- ) learning . 
 we first show that there is a computable learning algorithm in our universal setting . 
 then , in order to obtain bounds on the number of training samples that would be needed , we consider measuring sample complexity of the learning algorithm as a function of the unknown correct labeling function ( i.e.  target concept ) . although the correct labeling is unknown , this sample complexity measure could be used to compare learning algorithms speculatively : 
 if the target labeling were such and such , learning algorithm @xmath0 requires fewer samples than learning algorithm @xmath1 "" . by asking what is the largest sample size needed assuming the target labeling function is in a certain class 
 , we could compare the sample complexity of the universal learner to a learner over the restricted class ( e.g.  with finite vc - dimension ) . 
 however , we prove that it is impossible to bound the sample complexity of any _ computable _ universal learning algorithm , even as a function of the target concept . 
 depending on the distribution , any such bound will be exceeded with arbitrarily high probability . 
 the impossibility of a distribution - independent bound is entirely due to the computability requirement . 
 indeed we show there is an uncomputable learning procedure for which we bound the number of samples queried as a function of the unknown target concept , independently of the distribution . 
 our results imply that computable learning algorithms in the universal setting must  waste samples "" in the sense of requiring more samples than is necessary for statistical reasons alone . 
 there is comparatively little work in statistical learning theory on learning arbitrary computable classifiers compared to the volume of research on learning in more restricted settings . computational learning theory ( aka pac - learning ) 
 requires learning algorithms to be efficient in the sense of running in polynomial time of certain parameters  @xcite . 
 that work generally restricts learning to very limited concept / hypothesis spaces such as perceptrons , dnf expressions , limited - weight neural networks , etc . 
 the purely statistical learning theory paradigm ignores issues of computability  @xcite . 
 work on learning arbitrary computable functions is mostly in the  learning in the limit "" paradigm  @xcite , in which the goal of learning is to eventually converge to the perfectly correct hypothesis as opposed to approximating it with an approximately correct hypothesis . 
 the idea of allowing the learner to ask for a varying number of training samples based on the ones previously seen was studied before in statistical learning theory  @xcite . 
 linial et al  @xcite called this model  dynamic sampling "" and showed that dynamic sampling allows learning with a hypothesis space of infinite vc - dimension if all hypotheses can be enumerated . 
 this is essentially theorem  [ thm : uncomputablealgorithm ] of our paper . 
 however , the hypothesis space of all computable functions can not be enumerated by any algorithm , and thus these results do not directly imply the existence of a learning algorithm in our setting .    our proof technique for establishing positive results ( theorem  [ thm : learningalgorithmexists ] ) is parallel evaluation of all hypotheses , and is based on levin s universal search  @xcite . in learning theory , levin s 
 universal search was previously used by goldreich and ron  @xcite to evaluate all learning algorithms in parallel and obtain an algorithm with asymptotically optimal computation time . 
 the main negative result of this paper is showing the absence of distribution independent bounds on sample complexity for computable universal learning algorithms ( theorem  [ thm : nobound ] ) . 
 recently ryabko  @xcite considered learning arbitrary computable classifiers , albeit in a setting where the number of samples for the learning algorithm is externally chosen . 
 he demonstrated a computational difficulty in determining the number of samples needed : it grows faster than any computable function of the length of the target concept . in contrast 
 , we prove that distribution - independent bounds do not exist altogether for computable learning algorithms in our setting . 
 the _ sample space _ @xmath2 is the universe of possible points over which learning occurs . here 
 we will largely suppose the sample space @xmath2 is the set of all finite binary strings @xmath3 . 
 concept space _ @xmath4 and _ hypothesis space _ 
 @xmath5 are sets of boolean - valued functions over @xmath2 , which are said to _ label 
 _ points @xmath6 as @xmath7 . 
 the concept space @xmath4 is the set of all possible labeling functions that our learning algorithm may be asked to learn from . in each learning scenario 
 , there is some unknown _ target concept _ @xmath8 that represents the desired way of labeling points . 
 there is also an unknown _ sample distribution _ @xmath9 over @xmath2 . 
 the learning algorithm chooses a _ 
 @xmath10 based on iid samples drawn from @xmath9 and labeled according to the target concept @xmath11 . since we can not hope to distinguish between a hypothesis that is always correct and one that is correct most of the time , we adopt the  probably approximately correct ""  @xcite goal of producing with high probability ( @xmath12 ) a hypothesis @xmath13 such that the probability over @xmath14 that @xmath15 is small ( @xmath16 ) .    here we will mostly consider the concept space @xmath4 to be the set of all total recursive functions @xmath17 . 
 we say that this is a universal learning setting because @xmath4 includes any practical classification scheme . 
 we will mostly consider the hypothesis space to be the set of all partial recursive functions @xmath18 , where @xmath19 indicates failure to halt . from pac learning it is known that sometimes it helps to use different concept and hypothesis classes , if one desires the learning algorithm to be efficient  @xcite . in a related way , allowing our algorithm to output a partial recursive function that may not halt on all inputs seems to permit learning ( e.g.  theorem  [ thm : learningalgorithmexists ] ) . 
 abusing notation , @xmath8 or @xmath10 will refer to either the function or to a representation of that function as a program . 
 similarly @xmath4 and @xmath5 will refer to the sets of functions or to the sets of representations of the corresponding functions . 
 we assume all programs are written in some fixed alphabet and are interpreted by some fixed universal turing machine . if @xmath13 is a partial recursive function and @xmath20 then by convention @xmath21 for any partial recursive function @xmath22 ( even if @xmath23 also ) . 
 we can now define what we mean by a learning algorithm :    algorithm @xmath0 is a _ learning algorithm _ over sample space @xmath2 , concept space @xmath4 , and hypothesis space @xmath5 if :    * ( syntactic requirements ) @xmath0 takes two inputs @xmath24 and @xmath25 , queries an oracle for pairs in @xmath26 , and if @xmath0 halts it outputs a hypothesis @xmath10 . * 
 ( semantic requirements ) for any @xmath27 , for any concept @xmath8 , and distribution @xmath9 over @xmath2 , if the oracle returns pairs @xmath28 for @xmath29 drawn iid from @xmath9 , then @xmath0 always halts , and with probability at least @xmath12 outputs a hypothesis @xmath13 such that @xmath30 < { \varepsilon}$ ] 
 .    the always halting requirement seems a nice property of the learning algorithm and indeed the learning algorithm we develop ( theorem  [ thm : learningalgorithmexists ] ) will halt for any concept and sequence of samples . however , relaxing this requirement to allow a non - zero probability that the learning algorithm queries the oracle for infinitely many samples does not change our negative results ( theorem  [ thm : nobound ] ) , as long as a finite number of oracle calls implies halting . 
 the fundamental notion in statistical learning theory is that of sample complexity . since the vc - dimension of our hypothesis space is infinite , there is no _ uniform bound _ 
 @xmath31 on the number of samples needed to learn to the @xmath27 level of accuracy . 
 we will consider the question of whether for a given learning algorithm there is a _ distribution - independent bound _ 
 @xmath32 on the number of samples queried from the oracle where @xmath8 is the target hypothesis . in other words 
 the bound is allowed to depend on the target concept @xmath11 but not on the sample distribution @xmath9 . 
 such a bound may be satisfied with certainty , or satisfied with high probability over the learning samples . 
 we first show that there is a computable learning algorithm in our setting . 
 [ thm : learningalgorithmexists ] there is a learning algorithm over sample space @xmath2 of all finite binary strings , hypothesis space @xmath5 of all partial recursive functions , and concept space @xmath4 of all total recursive functions .    in order to prove this theorem we need the following lemma . 
 results equivalent to this lemma can be found in  @xcite . 
 [ lem : m ] let @xmath2 be any sample space and @xmath9 be any distribution over @xmath2 . fix any function @xmath33 . 
 suppose hypothesis space @xmath5 is countable , and let @xmath34 be some ordering of @xmath5 . 
 for any @xmath27 , let @xmath35 . 
 suppose @xmath36 is an infinite sequence of iid samples drawn from @xmath9 . 
 then the probability that there exists @xmath37 such that @xmath38 > { \varepsilon}$ ] , but @xmath39 agrees with @xmath11 on @xmath40 , is less than @xmath41 . 
 the probability that a particular @xmath39 with error probability @xmath38 > { \varepsilon}$ ] gets @xmath42 i.i.d . 
 instances drawn from @xmath9 correct is less than @xmath43 . by the union bound , 
 the probability that _ any _ @xmath39 with error probability greater than @xmath16 gets @xmath42 instances correct is less than @xmath44 . 
 * proof of theorem  [ thm : learningalgorithmexists ] : * let @xmath34 be a recursive enumeration of @xmath5 ( for example in lexicographic order ) . for the given @xmath27 , let @xmath42 be defined as in lemma  [ lem : m ] . 
 the learning algorithm computes infinitely many threads @xmath45 running in parallel . 
 this can be done by a standard dovetailing technique . 
 ( for example use the following schedule : for @xmath46 to infinity , for @xmath47 to k , perform step @xmath48 of thread @xmath49 . ) 
 thread @xmath49 sequentially checks whether @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , exiting if a check fails . 
 if all @xmath42 checks pass , thread @xmath49 terminates and outputs @xmath39 . 
 the learning algorithm queries the oracle as necessary for new learning samples and their labeling . 
 the overall algorithm terminates as soon as some thread outputs an @xmath39 , and outputs this hypothesis . by lemma  [ lem : m ] , with probability at least @xmath12 , this @xmath39 has error probability less than @xmath16 . 
 further , since @xmath54 , the learning algorithm will always terminate . 
 note that it seems necessary to expand the hypothesis space to include all partial recursive functions because the concept space of total recursive functions does not have a recursive enumeration ( it is uncomputable whether a given program is total recursive or not ) . 
 we will see in theorem  [ thm : nobound ] that there is no bound @xmath55 on the number of samples queried by any computable learning algorithm in our setting . 
 let us obtain some intuition for why that is true for the above learning algorithm . 
 then we will contrast this to the case of an uncomputable learning algorithm . 
 in essence , we can make the above learning algorithm query for more samples than is necessary for statistical reasons alone . 
 intuitively , suppose that an @xmath56 coming early in the ordering is always correct but takes a very long time to compute . 
 the learning algorithm can not wait for this @xmath56 to finish , because it does not know that any particular @xmath39 will ever halt . at some point it has to start testing @xmath39 s that come later in the ordering and that have larger @xmath42 s . 
 testing these requires more learning samples than @xmath57 . 
 if we can know which @xmath39 s are safe to skip over since they do nt halt , and for which @xmath39 s we should wait , then the above problem is solved . 
 indeed , the following theorem shows that there is no statistical reason why a distribution - independent bound @xmath55 is impossible . 
 the theorem presents a well defined method of learning ( albeit an uncomputable one ) for which there exists such a bound , and this bound is satisfied with certainty . 
 below , the halting oracle gives @xmath7 answers to questions of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 such that a @xmath60 answer indicates that @xmath61 halts and a @xmath62 answer indicates it does not ; the answers are clearly uncomputable . 
 [ thm : uncomputablealgorithm ] if a learning algorithm is allowed to query the halting oracle , then there is a learning algorithm over sample space @xmath2 of all finite binary strings , hypothesis space @xmath5 of all partial recursive functions , and concept space @xmath4 of all total recursive functions , and a function @xmath63 , such that for any approximation parameters @xmath27 , any target concept @xmath8 , and any distribution @xmath9 over @xmath2 , the learning algorithm uses at most @xmath55 training samples .    rather than dovetailing 
 as is done for the computable learning algorithm ( theorem  [ thm : learningalgorithmexists ] ) , we can sequentially test every @xmath39 on samples @xmath64 , @xmath52 , @xmath65 because we can determine whether @xmath39 halts on a given input . 
 since @xmath66 for some @xmath67 , the hypothesis @xmath39 we output will always satisfy @xmath68 , and therefore we will require at most @xmath69 samples . 
 we now show that for any _ computable _ learning algorithm , and any possible sample bound @xmath55 , there is a target concept @xmath11 and a sample distribution such that this sample bound is violated with high probability . 
 the probability of violation can be made arbitrarily close to @xmath70 ( which approaches @xmath60 as @xmath71 ) . 
 in fact this theorem is stronger : it shows that given a learning algorithm , without varying the target concept , but just by varying the distribution it is possible to make the algorithm ask for arbitrarily many learning samples with high probability . 
 [ thm : nobound ] for any learning algorithm over sample space @xmath2 of all finite binary strings , hypothesis space @xmath5 of all partial recursive functions , and concept space @xmath4 of all total recursive functions , there is a target concept @xmath8 , such that for any approximation parameters @xmath27 , for any @xmath72 , and for any sample bound @xmath73 there is a distribution @xmath9 over @xmath2 , such that the learning algorithm uses more than @xmath74 training samples with probability at least @xmath75 . 
 the key difference between a computable and an uncomputable learning algorithm , is that a concept can simulate a computable one . by simulating the learning algorithm , a concept can choose to behave in way that is bad for the learning algorithm s sample complexity .    to prove the above theorem 
 , we will first need the following lemma . 
 the lemma essentially shows a situation such that any learning algorithm according to our definition must query for more than @xmath74 learning samples with high probability when the target concept is chosen adversarily . 
 the lemma is true even without requiring the learning algorithm to be computable . 
 note that the lemma does not directly imply the theorem above , even in its weaker form , because in order to increase the number of learning samples that are likely queried by the learning algorithm , we have to change the target concept . since @xmath55 is a function of @xmath11 , 
 there is no guarantee that the bound does nt become larger as well . 
 [ lem : probabilisticmethod ] let @xmath2 be a set of @xmath76 points , and let @xmath4 be the set of all labelings of @xmath2 . 
 let @xmath9 be a uniform distribution over @xmath2 . 
 suppose @xmath0 is a learning algorithm over sample space @xmath2 , concept and hypothesis space @xmath4 . 
 for any accuracy parameters @xmath27 and any @xmath77 , there is a concept @xmath8 such that when the oracle draws from @xmath9 labeled according to @xmath11 the probability that @xmath0 samples more than @xmath74 points is at least @xmath78 . 
 we use the probabilistic method to find a particularly bad concept @xmath79 . 
 suppose we do not start with a fixed target concept @xmath11 , but draw it uniformly from @xmath4 . 
 in other words , @xmath11 is determined by values @xmath80 drawn uniformly from @xmath81 . given some @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , the value of @xmath85 is a fair coin flip . 
 thus if on @xmath82 labeled by @xmath83 , @xmath0 outputs a hypothesis without asking for more samples , then the hypothesis is incorrect on @xmath29 with probability @xmath86 . if we now let @xmath29 vary , the probability that the hypothesis is incorrect on @xmath29 is at least @xmath87 since there are at least @xmath88 points not in @xmath82 . 
 now suppose for any @xmath11 the probability that @xmath0 samples more than @xmath74 points is at most @xmath75 . 
 then the unconditional probability that the hypothesis output by @xmath0 is incorrect on a random sample point is at least @xmath89 . 
 this implies that there is a concept @xmath90 such that the probability that the hypothesis output by @xmath0 is incorrect on a random sample point is at least @xmath89 .    since @xmath0 is a learning algorithm , when we use @xmath79 to label the training points , and use accuracy parameters @xmath27 , the probability that the hypothesis produced by @xmath0 has error probability greater than @xmath16 is at most @xmath41 . 
 if we make the worst case assumption that whenever the error probability of the hypothesis is larger than @xmath16 it is exactly @xmath60 , and otherwise the error probability is exactly @xmath16 , then the probability that the hypothesis output by @xmath0 is incorrect on a random sample point is at most @xmath91 . 
 thus @xmath92 , implying that @xmath93 . 
 now in order to prove theorem  [ thm : nobound ] , we essentially show that there is some fixed concept @xmath79 that behaves as the bad @xmath11 s in arbitrary instances of lemma  [ lem : probabilisticmethod ] .

 first it interprets the given string @xmath95 as a tuple @xmath96 for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath97 using some fixed one - to - one encoding of such tuples as binary strings . if @xmath29 can not be decoded appropriately , or if @xmath98 then @xmath99 returns @xmath62 
 otherwise , for these @xmath100 , let @xmath101 be the set of @xmath76 strings which are interpreted as @xmath102 , @xmath52 , @xmath103 , and let @xmath104 be a uniform distribution over @xmath105 and @xmath62 elsewhere . 
 let @xmath106 be the set of all possible labelings of @xmath105 . 
 for each labeling @xmath107 , program @xmath99 computes the probability @xmath108 that @xmath0 given accuracy parameters @xmath27 , queries for more than @xmath74 sample points if points are drawn from @xmath104 labeled according to @xmath109 . 
 for each @xmath109 , this requires simulating @xmath0 for at most @xmath110 different sequences of sample points . 
 let @xmath111 , breaking ties in some fixed way . 
 finally @xmath99 outputs @xmath112 . 
 observe that @xmath99 is total recursive since @xmath0 spends a finite time on any finite sequence of sample points . 
 ( this is a weaker condition than the always halting requirement of our definition of a learning algorithm . ) 
 thus @xmath99 is some @xmath90 . 
 further , for any @xmath100 , on all points @xmath113 for @xmath114 , @xmath99 finds the same @xmath115 , and thus on these points @xmath79 acts like this @xmath115 . by lemma  [ lem : probabilisticmethod ] , if @xmath77 then this @xmath115 has the property that @xmath116 . 
 therefore , if @xmath0 is given accuracy parameters @xmath27 , the target concept is @xmath79 , and the distribution @xmath9 is uniform over @xmath117 for some @xmath118 such that @xmath77 , then the probability that @xmath0 requests more than @xmath74 samples is at least @xmath78 . since we can choose @xmath9 such that @xmath76 is large enough , we obtain the desired result . 
 we have shown that learning arbitrary computable classifiers is possible in the statistical learning paradigm . 
 however for any computable learning algorithm , the number of samples required to learn to a desired level of accuracy may become arbitrarily large depending on the sample distribution . 
 this is in contrast to uncomputable learning methods in the same universal setting whose sample complexity can be bounded independently of the distribution . 
 our results mean that there is a big price in terms of sample complexity to be paid for the combination of universality and computability of the learner . specifically , by tweaking the distribution we can make a computable universal learner arbitrarily worse than a restricted learning algorithm on a finite vc - dimensional hypothesis space , or even an uncomputable universal learner . 
 while we have presented a single computable learning algorithm in our universal setting , one would like to develop a measure that would allow different learning algorithms to be compared to each other in terms of sample complexity . 
 we have seen that sample complexity @xmath55 is not such a measure ; is there a viable alternative ?    finally , we have ignored computation time in our analysis . as such , 
 our learning algorithm is not likely to have practical significance . 
 integrating running time into the theory presented would be a critical extension .","statistical learning theory chiefly studies restricted hypothesis classes , particularly those with finite vapnik - chervonenkis ( vc ) dimension .

44,"it is well known that in standard model ( sm ) the higgs quartic coupling has a landau pole for a sufficiently heavy higgs mass . 
 the position of the pole is a function of the higgs boson mass . for light enough mass of the higgs boson , either landau pole is higher than the plank scale or it disappears , and the unitarity of sm is preserved . 
 however very quickly as @xmath5 approaches @xmath6 the landau pole becomes close to the @xmath7 scale and as a consequence the perturbative unitarity is broken in longitudinal gauge boson scattering amplitudes . 
 this is known as unitarity bound on higgs boson mass @xcite , which relates the higgs mass to the energy scale at which the unitarity is broken in sm . 
 this scale , as a function of @xmath5 represents a scale at which either some new particles should come in and save unitarity , or otherwise , the sm becomes strongly coupled . 
 note that in this paper we refer to unitarity of sm in the presence of the higgs boson , not to be confused with analysis of longitudinal gauge boson scattering in the absence of higgs boson , in which case unitarity is violated at much lower scales .    in the standard analysis of unitarity bound on higgs mass for sm the equivalence theorem@xcite 
 is used to relate the longitudinal gauge boson scattering amplitude to the corresponding scalar scattering , including unphysical goldstone boson modes in the @xmath8 gauge . at tree level and high energies 
 these amplitudes are purely @xmath9waves , proportional to higgs self - coupling @xmath10 . 
 naive analysis of loop contributions of su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge bosons to say @xmath11 amplitude seems to give very small result , because couplings @xmath12 are small . 
 however such amplitudes contain sudakov double logarithms@xcite-@xcite , and in a series of recent papers @xcite@xmath13@xcite it was shown how in the effective theory approach one can resum these large logarithms . 
 the results of @xcite@xmath13@xcite are that at the @xmath7 scale such sudakov resummation leads to decrease in the cross section for processes like @xmath14 up to @xmath15 , a suppression factor that rapidly increases with the center of mass energy . in a recent paper @xcite 
 it was shown that electroweak sudakov corrections play a significant role in top quark forward backward asymmetry . 
 it is the purpose of this paper to go beyond the traditional tree level unitarity analysis of sm and study how higher order corrections , which are part of sm and can be calculated using existing techniques , modify the unitarity bound of sm . 
 the paper is organized as follows : in section [ seq : theo ] we briefly review the approach developed in @xcite@xmath13@xcite to resum electroweak logarithms for high - energy processes . in section [ seq : ww ] 
 we derive the effect of electroweak large logarithm resummation on the high energy behavior of longitudinal gauge bosons and higgs scattering amplitudes . 
 we study the applications of derived corrections to the sm unitarity bound in section [ seq : unitarity ] . 
 we conclude in section [ seq : concl ] . 
 soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite@xmath13@xcite is an effective theory for highly energetic quarks and gluons . 
 recently it has been extended in @xcite@xmath13@xcite to standard model to compute renormalization group improved amplitudes for sm including resummation of sudakov large double - logarithms from loops with su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge bosons . 
 the computation can be divided in three steps . 
 first we integrate out the hard modes at the scale of center of mass energy @xmath16 for our scattering process . for @xmath17 process 
 we match on four - particle contact operators in eft , which is referred to as @xmath18 with massless su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge bosons . 
 this leaves us with some basis of operators and wilson coefficients , which only contain @xmath19 and can be minimized by scale choice @xmath16 . 
 next the effective operators in @xmath18 have to be evolved down to the weak scale @xmath20 . in order to relate the wilson coefficients at low scale to the ones obtained by matching on previous step at high scale one needs to exponentiate the anomalous dimension matrix , which consists from collinear and soft parts . 
 this anomalous dimension has been studied and calculated to one loop order for any process in sm in @xcite@xmath13@xcite . finally at the low scale @xmath21 one has to match onto broken theory where gauge bosons have been removed . as a result one gets the effective amplitude for scattering of gauge bosons and quarks and leptons with resummed large logarithms . 
 the corresponding amplitude in @xmath18 gets the following factorized form@xcite : @xmath22 \,p\exp\left(\int_{\mu_h}^{\mu_l}\frac{d\mu}{\mu}{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}(\alpha(\mu))\right)\nonumber\\ & & \qquad\,\,\,\times{\boldsymbol{c}}\left(\alpha(\mu_h),\left\{\ln\frac{p_i{\!\cdot\!}p_j}{\mu_h^2}\right\}\right),\label{mresummaster}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the column vector of wilson coefficients obtained from matching at high scale , @xmath24 is the anomalous dimension of effective operator , which is a matrix in the color space , and finally @xmath25 appears as a result of the low scale matching . 
 the anomalous dimension for a general hard scattering process has the form @xmath26 , where collinear anomalous dimension is a sum of collinear anomalous dimensions associated with each leg and soft anomalous dimension has a non - trivial color structure but is universal in the sense that it only depends on light - cone directions and color flow . 
 we derive in this section electroweak radiative correction contribution to the amplitude of longitudinal gauge and/or higgs boson scattering amplitude . the corresponding formalism has been developed in @xcite@xmath13@xcite and was briefly reviewed in section [ seq : theo ] . 
 following these references we use the equivalence theorem to relate gauge boson amplitude to the corresponding unphysical scalar amplitude in @xmath8 gauge . 
 this method was applied in refs . 
 @xcite@xmath13@xcite to derive longitudinal gauge boson production at lhc to next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic order(nnll ) , except for scalar contribution at two loops that is missing for some parts . 
 we work at next - to - leading logarithmic order ( nll ) .      at the scale @xmath27 
 we integrate out hard modes and leave only collinear modes , corresponding to four external label momenta . for our purpose 
 the higgs quartic coupling gives the biggest contribution to the matching . 
 we neglect the gauge boson mediated interactions between the scalars , since they are suppressed by the ratio of weak coupling to higgs self - coupling @xmath28 . the tree level matching is given by higgs quartic term in the sm lagrangian , and is trivial : @xmath29 the higgs quartic coupling has a familiar landau pole at higher energies , and is given at one loop order : @xmath30 while @xmath31 . 
 equation eq .   is valid approximation for @xmath32 . for lower masses 
 one has to include contribution of top quark yukawa coupling and the landau pole disappears . we come back to this case at the end of section [ seq : unitarity ] .      from high scale 
 the wilson coefficients must be evolved to the low scale @xmath34 which is of the order of the electroweak scale @xmath35 . 
 this is achieved by calculating the anomalous dimension of the four particle operator in the effective theory @xmath18@xcite . 
 the anomalous dimension for such process can be written as sum of process dependent collinear anomalous dimension , which is simply the sum over the corresponding terms for each leg , and the universal soft anomalous dimension @xcite , which only depends on kinematics and color structure , but is same for say scalars or fermions . 
 thus the collinear part of anomalous dimension we know from @xcite@xmath13@xcite and the soft part of the anomalous dimension is same as in @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for @xmath39 the soft anomalous dimension to one loop 
 is known @xcite , it was derived for @xmath39 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 in refs 
 . @xcite . since 
 our effective operators are ( su(3))color singlets , the anomalous dimension gets contribution only from su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge bosons . 
 the result for the total anomalous dimension is : @xmath40\right)\nonumber\\ & & + \frac{\alpha_1}{\pi}2y_{\phi}^2 \left((t - u)-i\pi\right),\label{gammasoft}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the mandelstam invariants are defined according to @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the scattering angle in the center of mass frame , defined as angle between momenta of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the cm frame . 
 we will need the formula for the anomalous dimension in the universal form in terms of mandelstam variables @xmath46 , without assuming that @xmath47 as in eq .   above . 
 the corresponding analytic continuation looks as follows : @xmath48\right),\label{gtotanalytic}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xcite . 
 it is useful to have an analytical formula for ( matrix ) exponential of the integral from @xmath33 to @xmath34 of anomalous dimension in eq . 
 that appears in the resummed amplitude in eq . 
 : @xmath51 evaluation of @xmath52 requires standard tricks to switch integration from @xmath53 to @xmath54 using the beta - function as well as matrix exponentiation . 
 the former has been analytically performed in the appendix a of ref . 
 @xcite while the latter is a simple exercise for 2 by 2 matrices . rewriting the anomalous dimension in terms of cusp and non - cusp part : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and inex @xmath57 corresponds to @xmath38 and @xmath58 to @xmath37 parts of the sm gauge group and values for cusp and non - cusp parts are summarized in the table below 
 note that the @xmath33 dependence in the non - cusp part of the anomalous dimension is cancelled exactly by same dependence in the log term in eq .   and 
 is introduced in order to use master formula from appendix a of ref . 
 @xcite for the integral of the anomalous dimension . 
 finally we get for the exponential factor in eq .   a fully analytic expression :    @xmath59 , \,\,\,\text{where}\\ & & \omega=\sum_{k=1}^2\frac{{\pi a_{1k}}\big[z_k\ln z_k+1-z_k\big]}{b_{0k}^2\,\alpha_k(\mu_l)}+\frac{a_{1k}b_{1k}}{4b_{0k}^3}\left[\ln z_k - z_k-\frac{1}{2}\ln^2{z_k}+1\right]+\frac{a_{2k}}{4b_{0k}^2}\left[z_k-\ln z_k-1\right]-\frac{\tilde{b}_{1k}}{2b_{0k}}\ln z_k,\label{omegadinasour}\\ & & w=\frac{2}{b_{02}}\ln z_2 , \qquad\qquad\delta=\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}\text{l}_{tu / s^2}^2+\frac{3}{4}\text{l}_{t / u}^2}.\end{aligned}\ ] ]    in the equation above we defined @xmath60 , @xmath61 are the two lowest order beta - function coefficients for @xmath38 and @xmath37 and @xmath62 are the one and two - loop cusp anomalous dimension coefficients and one - loop non - cusp anomalous dimension coefficient . 
 they are all summarized in the table below . 
 note that @xmath63 is defined in such a way that it is same as @xmath64 for @xmath57 and is equal to part of @xmath65 which is proportional to unit matrix , i.e. omitting term @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the matrix in the second term of the second line in eq .  , which comes from soft anomalous dimension . 
 the leading - logarithm ( ll ) expression is significantly simpler and is given by first term in the expression for @xmath68 in eq .  : 
 @xmath69}{b_{0k}^2\,\alpha_k(\mu_l)}}\right),\label{eq : gammall}\end{aligned}\ ] ] and unlike the nll expression , the ll one is proportional to unit matrix , has no angular dependance at fixed scales @xmath70 and does not depend on any momenta ( @xmath71 ) before setting the scale @xmath72 .    [ cols=""<,^,>"",options=""header "" , ]      at the low scale @xmath35 we integrate out @xmath73 and @xmath74 bosons , and match onto @xmath75 with only photons ( and of course gluons , but for our purpose they are irrelevant ) . at tree level 
 we simply rewrite each doublet @xmath76 in our operator basis @xmath77 in terms of broken fields : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 and we omitted the higgs vev since we are interested in four - particle interactions only . 
 writing the operators @xmath81 and @xmath82 in terms of four - particle operators involving fields @xmath83 is straightforward but contains a great number of terms . 
 it is more convenient to work in the basis of fields @xmath84 , where @xmath85 since the number of possible terms with such a choice in the effective lagrangian is minimal . at the low scale @xmath34 the operators in eq . 
 match onto the following ones : @xmath86 with wilson coefficients @xmath87 , where @xmath88 coefficients @xmath89 at the high scale are given in eq . 
 -eq .  , while at the low scale they are equal to : @xmath90 the matching matrix @xmath91 at tree level is found simply by substituting eq .   into the definition of operators @xmath77 . 
 the result is : @xmath92^t.\end{aligned}\ ] ] finally for consistency if we stay at nll order we need to include the matching at low scale at one loop , because this matching contains large logarithms @xmath93 and due to finite difference @xmath94 in sm , these large logarithm has to be included at nll order in sm @xcite . 
 this calculation in sm is tricky and has been performed consistently in ref . 
 the result is that the scalar doublet has to be matched on physical states below @xmath34 , which are @xmath95 and each component of the doublet gets different matching correction which can be found in @xcite for general case @xmath96 . for nll order and setting @xmath97 
 , the entire doublet gets the same matching correction . 
 the resummed matrix element gets multiplied as a result of low scale matching by a factor @xmath98 , where @xmath99 has simple expression for this case : @xmath100 by setting @xmath97 we get a simple expression , however the price we pay is that we will not be able to evaluate the low - scale variation consistently . 
 we will only include high - scale variation @xmath33 in our plots below . including the low scale matching , 
 the tree level matrix @xmath101 gets modified : @xmath102      now that we have calculated the matrix element including resummation of electroweak sudakov logarithms , it is straightforward to construct the lagrangian of effective theory : @xmath103 another simplification we will use is to rewrite the color - triplet operator as a combination of two color singlet operators with different contractions : @xmath104 with @xmath105 for @xmath37 . 
 thus , since momenta @xmath106 have to be summed over , and also the lagrangian before low - scale matching looks like @xmath107 , we can use identity in eq .   and reshuffle the momenta @xmath108 in the first term of eq .   to make it look like the second term ( @xmath82 ) with reshuffled momenta in the argument of the wilson coefficient @xmath109 . as a result we reduced our basis of operators to only one : 
 @xmath82 and lagrangian takes form : @xmath110 there is one subtlety at this point , which is whether we set the hard scale @xmath111 before the summation in the lagrangian , or we set this scale after taking the matrix element with external states . 
 we chose to do the later while the former would give a different numerical result . 
 however the difference should be within hard scale variation , thus of the higher order , i.e. nnll .    at nll order 
 the function @xmath112 is equal to : @xmath113 at ll it is independent of loop momenta completely : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is given in eq .  .      with effective theory lagrangian found in the previous subsection 
 it is a straightforward exercise to evaluate matrix elements of longitudinal gauge and higgs boson scattering amplitudes . 
 for example the amplitude for @xmath11 scattering is given by : @xmath117 where this matrix element has to be evaluated with effective lagrangian given in eq .   and 
 basis operators @xmath118 in eq .  . 
 defining the basis of normalized states@xcite @xmath119 : @xmath120 and similarly in the final state the basis states @xmath121 can be found by substituting @xmath122 . 
 the @xmath123 matrix elements of effective theory in this basis equal to : @xmath124,\nonumber\\\label{smatrix}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath125 and @xmath126 appear due to combinatorics because of different contractions . at tree level 
 this leads to combinatorial factors , while in our case different contractions lead to different crossing of @xmath46 parameters : @xmath127 and function @xmath112 is given to ll order in eq .   and to nll order in eq . 
 note that at ll all functions @xmath128 are identical ( due to our choice to set the scale @xmath33 after taking the matrix element of effective theory operators , as we discussed above ) , and we get that the @xmath123 matrix has a simple form : @xmath129.\nonumber\\\label{llsmatrix}\end{aligned}\ ] ] thus we find a simple result that at leading - logarithm order , including electroweak sudakov logarithms , the entire tree level @xmath116matrix@xcite gets multiplied by a universal number @xmath130 given in eq .  . 
 to get numerical results one has to plug in @xmath131 and scale variation can be used as usual as an estimate of theoretical uncertainties .    also note that the ll result for the amplitude has no angular dependence , 
 the scattering remains @xmath9wave similarly to tree level result . 
 the non - trivial angular dependence appears only at nll order . 
 finally , note that @xmath132 , which follows from @xmath133 . 
 thus in @xmath9 wave analysis , the amplitude @xmath134 including electroweak sudakov logarithms at nll order vanishes . 
 same is true at tree level : amplitude @xmath134 _ only vanishes in _ @xmath9wave and @xmath135 and @xmath136 _ vanish identically_@xcite .      in this subsection we will use the general @xmath116 matrix derived in the previous subsection at nll order to numerically study the nll order electroweak sudakov logarithms in @xmath138 cross section . this process does not provide the tightest bound for traditional unitarity bound analysis of standard model @xcite . 
 nevertheless we provide this as an illustration to the effect of electroweak logarithms for longitudinal gauge boson scattering cross sections . 
 as was found in the previous subsection at ll order all other processes are proportional to each other , i.e. to the one considered in this subsection , the only non - trivial difference appears at nll order .    since at ll @xmath9wave analysis is exact , at nll order we expect it to be a good approximation . 
 thus , we define functions @xmath139 which are given by : @xmath140 how this functions depend on energy controls the @xmath9wave analysis of cross - section with longitudinal gauge and higgs bosons . in figure 
 [ fig : numerics1 ] we present this dependence for all functions @xmath141 . 
 the left of this figure is function @xmath142 with breakdown of contributions from separately ll su(2 ) only sudakov corrections(red ) , ll su(2)xu(1 ) sudakov corrections(green ) and nll su(2 ) ( blue ) and finally full nll su(2)xu(1 ) sudakov corrections ( black ) . 
 the right plot in figure [ fig : numerics1 ] represents the full nll su(2)xu(1 ) sudakov corrections for each function @xmath143 . 
 it turns out that to this order there are only two non - trivial functions : @xmath144 and @xmath145 as shown in that figure . 
 the reason @xmath144 has been explained at the end of previous subsection . by the same argument 
 it is clear that @xmath146 and @xmath147 . 
 numerically it so happens that they all are the same at this order , which could be explained if one completely ignores the angular dependence in @xmath126 . 
 the horizontal axis for @xmath148 goes all the way to the planck scale . as expected at low energies the sudakov corrections 
 are small , however very quickly they reduce amplitude at tree level by a factor of @xmath149 at the cm energy @xmath150 . 
 having studied the generic behavior of scattering amplitudes of longitudinal gauge bosons ( and higgs ) , we specialize to the case of @xmath151 : @xmath152 where function @xmath153 we calculate by two methods . 
 first is exact , keeping the full angular dependence in the amplitude , coming from nll order ( see eq .  ): 
 @xmath154 in the second method we use @xmath9wave approximation : @xmath155 both functions are plotted in the left part of figure [ fig : numerics2 ] . it is comforting to see , that there is a good agreement between the exact and @xmath9wave approximated cross sections , since at leading logarithmic order the entire amplitude is a pure @xmath9wave . while it is interesting that the electroweak corrections reduce the @xmath156 scattering cross section so dramatically at high energies , @xmath157 at the cm energy of @xmath158 , one should keep in mind that depending on the higgs mass @xmath5 , the quartic coupling @xmath159 has a landau pole and extending predictions beyond that scale is meaningless . as an illustration , on the right part of figure [ fig : numerics2 ] we include the higgs coupling and plot the function @xmath160 for different higgs masses . as expected 
 the cross section blows up at the landau pole , which is unaffected by sudakov corrections . 
 however for lighter higgs masses ( @xmath161 ) , almost everywhere except the vicinity of the landau pole , the cross section is significantly suppressed due to sudakov double logarithms . 
 the standard analysis of unitarity bound of sm @xcite includes longitudinal gauge boson scattering amplitudes at tree level @xcite and in refs . 
 @xcite the running of the higgs quartic coupling @xmath159 is included as well as improved unitarity bound @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the @xmath9partial wave of the scattering amplitude @xmath164 . 
 general expansion for the amplitude in terms of spherical harmonics is given by : @xmath165 inverting eq . 
 we find : @xmath166 taking into account the resummation of electroweak logarithms as derived in section [ seq : ww ] leads at nll order to some non - trivial @xmath167etc partial waves , due to angular dependence of @xmath168 , while at ll such dependence is absent . at tree level @xmath169 and plugging elements of eq .   into eq .   for @xmath170 
 we reproduce correctly the tree level result@xcite : @xmath171.\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the tightest bound for unitarity analysis is given by eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to largest eigenvalue . 
 the eigenvalues in the units of @xmath172 are @xmath173 . 
 the largest eigenvalue corresponds to eigenchannel @xmath174 . 
 however in @xcite this state is not used for unitarity bound , since for heavy enough higgs mass the scale @xmath175 where unitarity of sm breaks becomes close to higgs mass , thus the state under consideration is kinematically not allowed . 
 instead in @xcite the isospin zero state @xmath176 is used and the unitarity bound is a factor of @xmath177 weaker for this state however the problem mentioned above is absent . 
 now our goal is to re - derive the scale where sm unitarity is broken by extending it from tree level , to including the sudakov double logarithms that we have calculated in section [ seq : ww ] for arbitrary longitudinal gauge or higgs boson scattering to nll order . since we found that at ll , there is a simple multiplicative factor for @xmath116 matrix ( see eq .  ) 
 we can simply make the same choice of the state @xmath176 as in @xcite as our candidate to give the best unitarity bound . 
 this is not true at nll , but corrections should be small . also it is an apple - to - apple comparison to @xcite , where the tree level amplitude and one - loop higgs quartic running have been included into analysis . 
 we limit ourself to unitarity bound @xmath178 as in @xcite , although at very high energies as we will see below the imaginary parts and higher harmonics start to play role due to nll effects .    in order to understand the role of higher harmonics @xmath179 which appear due to nll order sudakov double logarithms , as well as the imaginary parts of scattering partial waves , we plotted in figure [ fig : numerics3 ] the real and imaginary parts of first three harmonics : @xmath180 as function of @xmath148 specifically for the @xmath176 channel , which is a simple exercise given eq .   and 
 eq .  . for energies around @xmath181 
 higher partial waves become comparable to @xmath163 , although still smaller . also for @xmath182 the imaginary part of @xmath163 becomes bigger than the real part . 
 we turn to the unitarity bound of standard model including the electroweak sudakov resummation . in figure 
 [ fig : numerics4 ] we present our results for unitarity bounds on @xmath176 scattering . 
 the red curve is simply the position of landau pole as a function of higgs mass . 
 we use one - loop beta function for quartic coupling including only self coupling contribution to the beta function , which is a good approximation for heavier higgs masses . the green curve in figure [ fig : numerics4 ] 
 represents the unitarity bound found in @xcite , i.e. requiring @xmath183 and including higgs quartic coupling one loop running . 
 including electroweak logarithms into the formula for the amplitude we get the dashed blue curve ( ll ) and solid blue curve ( nll ) . 
 finally , let us address the role of electroweak logarithms and unitarity scales for the case of light higgs mass which is favorable from current lhc bounds . 
 simple formula in eq . 
 considered above is not applicable in this case . in ref.@xcite beta functions of all couplings of sm 
 are computed to two - loop order . 
 for simplicity we only use their results constraining ourselves to one - loop , including running of couplings of sm : @xmath184 and ignoring remaining yukawa couplings . note the different normalization(factor of 2 ) between @xcite and us for @xmath28 , and @xmath185 in @xcite 
 is same as @xmath186 , while @xmath187 are same as our @xmath188 and @xmath189 and @xmath190 . as a result 
 we get the left plot in figure [ fig : numerics5 ] for higgs masses @xmath191 . 
 as one can see the qualitative behavior is very much different than for heavy higgs masses . instead of landau pole , we get a fixed point at high energies as well as the change in the sign of the quartic coupling at an energy scale that depends on the mass of the higgs boson . similar behavior of quartic coupling was found for higgs mass around @xmath192 in ref.@xcite , which used state - of - the art analysis , including full two - loop running of all couplings .    as a result for light higgs masses shown in the left part of figure [ fig : numerics5 ] 
 we see that the coupling remains perturbative to planck scale . 
 furthermore , as one can see from the red plot in the right part of figure [ fig : numerics5 ] , the tree level @xmath9wave partial amplitude for unitarity constraining scattering of the state @xmath176 is within the unitary limit @xmath193 for all center of mass energies all the way to the planck scale . the electroweak logarithms modify this amplitude by reducing it significantly at high energies . 
 for example at @xmath194 the suppression factor is of the order @xmath195 . 
 thus for phenomenologically interesting low higgs masses , the unitarity is preserved at all scales . 
 the role of electroweak logarithms is suppression of the amplitude ( and cross section ) at high energies compared to tree level result . 
 we have computed to next - to - leading logarithmic order the effect of electroweak sudakov logarithms for any longitudinal gauge or higgs boson scattering amplitude . at 
 leading - logarithmic order the amplitude gets multiplied by a universal function @xmath196 , independent of the concrete process and with strong dependence on energy . 
 for example , the high energy behavior of the function @xmath112 for @xmath197reduces the tree level cross section suppressed by a factor ranging from @xmath198 at @xmath199 to @xmath200 at @xmath201 . 
 this correction does not depend ( at our order ) on higgs mass . 
 of course the entire approach becomes intractable for energies above the landau pole of the quartic coupling @xmath28 . 
 this kind of behavior at high energies affects the unitarity bound of sm . despite the sudakov suppression , 
 when energy gets close to quartic landau pole , the singularity still wins in the very vicinity of the pole and the unitarity is still broken .    for heavier higgs masses , the landau pole appears very close to the higgs mass , so the electroweak logarithms do not get a chance to contribute significantly , since at those scales the logarithms are small . in this limit 
 the unitarity bound is unaffected . 
 however for lighter higgs masses , ( but still @xmath202)when the landau pole gets further and further from the electroweak scale , the electroweak corrections play a dramatic role for the high energy behavior of the longitudinal gauge boson scattering , by pushing the scale where the unitarity of sm is broken very close to the landau pole energy scale , thus restoring unitarity except in the immediate vicinity of the pole . 
 this qualitative picture can be easily seen in figure [ fig : numerics4 ] . 
 finally for very light higgs mass around @xmath203 , which is currently phenomenologically favorable , the quartic coupling remains perturbative at all scales and preserves unitarity at all scales , both at tree level and when electroweak logarithms are included , which suppress amplitude and cross section of longitudinal gauge boson scattering significantly at high energies . 
 this can be seen from figure [ fig : numerics5 ] .

45,"the gaseous component of protoplanetary disks is crucial for understanding the planet formation process because it affects the structures and evolution of the disk via chemical reactions . 
 theoretical studies have predicted that protoplanetary disks have multiple layers in their vertical direction due to stellar radiation . 
 these include a relatively cool midplane , in which most of the molecules are depleted onto grains , a molecular - rich intermediate layer , and a hot surface layer ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ) . because the physical environment differs among layers , gas phase abundances also vary significantly 
 atomic carbon ( c ) is considered to be abundant in the disk surface where far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons drive the energy balance and gas chemistry , i.e. , the photon dominated region ( pdr ) . 
 theoretical studies predict that in the pdr , fuv photons with energies less than the ionization energy of hydrogen ( 13.6 ev ) dissociate molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide ( co ) and ionize c to yield ionized carbon ( c@xmath8 ) @xcite . 
 when significant attenuation is achieved , a thin h / h@xmath9 transition layer should appear , beyond which hydrogen molecules dominate . because the ionization energy of c is 11.6 ev , 
 c@xmath8 is dominant at the lower density regions of the pdr . 
 deeper to the pdr , the carbon - ionizing radiation is attenuated , and co forms via various chemical reactions . as a result , for the uniform pdr 
 , c exists in a thin layer sandwiched between the c@xmath8 and co layers .    because photoevaporation at the disk surface is believed to govern the gas dispersal @xcite , observations of c are crucial for understanding disk dissipation . 
 moreover , the observations of c are also important in terms of dust evolution in the disk because it affects the chemistry as a result of changes in the uv radiation field propagation and thus the intensity of the c line @xcite . 
 however , detection of the submillimeter fine structure c lines has not been reported for protoplanetary disks thus far . 
 although a few studies have attempted to detect the emission lines of c from protoplanetary disks around intermediate - mass stars , only upper limits have been obtained @xcite .    in this paper 
 , we present the results of [ c  i ] @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0p@xmath2 and @xmath10co @xmath3=43 observations with the band 8 qualification model receiver mounted on the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) , and report the first detection of [ c  i ] emission from a protoplanetary disk . 
 we estimate the optical depth of the emission to derive the column density of c , and discuss possible evolutionary trends in the total mass of atomic c. 
 we performed [ c  i ] @xmath0p@xmath1@xmath0p@xmath2 ( 492.161 ghz ) and co @xmath1143 ( 461.041 ghz ) observations toward three classical t tauri stars ( ttss ) , , , and , in november 2010 using the aste . 
 target information is listed in table [ tab : info ] . in addition , we made [ c  i ] observations toward two protostars ( pss ) in taurus , l1551 irs 5 and hl tau , to check the consistency of the observational data . 
 we also used these data as a reference of the [ c  i ] intensity during the ps phase of star formation . 
 the observations were taken with an alma band 8 ( 400500 ghz ) qualification model heterodyne receiver ( band 8 qm ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) mounted on the aste . 
 the band 8 qm uses sideband separating receivers that detect two orthogonal polarizations and down - convert the sideband - separated intermediate frequency signals to 48 ghz . 
 the half power beam width ( hpbw ) was @xmath12 and the main beam efficiency @xmath13 was estimated to be 45% from observations of jupiter . for the backend , we used mac , a 1024 channel digital auto - correlator , which has a band width of 128 mhz and a resolution of 125 khz , corresponding to 78 and 0.076 km s@xmath14 , respectively . 
 the position switch method was employed and a single spectrum toward the source position was obtained for each target . because our tts targets are well known to be less affected by surrounding clouds , we selected off positions near the targets to effectively remove atmospheric fluctuations ; 28 , 15 , and 1 arcmin from the stellar positions of dm tau , lkca 15 , and tw hya , respectively . for the pss , we employed an off position of ( @xmath15 , @xmath16)=(4@xmath17 32@xmath18 6@xmath190 , 17@xmath20 48@xmath21 51@xmath220 ) , which was determined to avoid the co @xmath1110 emission of the l1551 cloud @xcite . 
 the telescope pointing calibration was performed every 1.52 hours by observing o - cet and irc+10216 in the co @xmath1143 emission line , and the resulting pointing accuracy was @xmath233 . any time variation in intensity scale was checked by observing part of the orion horse - head nebula ( position a ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) two or three times daily and was found to be less than @xmath2410% . 
 the [ c  i ] data were obtained under good sky conditions ( @xmath25 ) , whereas @xmath260.060.10 for the co observations . 
 the single sideband system noise temperatures were typically 2100 k and 3100 k for [ c  i ] and co , respectively . 
 data reduction and analysis were performed using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) version 3.3.0 software suite , in addition to its asap modules . 
 it should be noted that we reduced only one polarization dataset because of a beam alignment problem during the observations . 
 bad data were removed by the _ 
 sdflag _ task , baseline fitting and subtraction of the baseline from the spectra were performed with the _ sdbaseline _ task , and the data sets were combined in each source with the _ sdaverage _ task . 
 the final spectra were obtained after smoothing with a five pixel boxcar function along the channel axis by the _ sdsmooth _ 
 task , corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath27 km s@xmath14 .

 the line profile is single peaked with a central velocity of @xmath316.1 km s@xmath14 , which is consistent with the systemic velocity of the circumstellar disk as estimated by molecular line observations ( 5.9 km s@xmath14 ; e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 the emission appeared to be slightly asymmetric with a somewhat larger extent to redshifted velocities . 
 this is similar to the spectral shape of the co @xmath1143 and other co transitions .

 , we did not detect any [ c  i ] emission , and obtained only the 3@xmath33 upper limits shown in table [ tab : spec ] . to estimate upper limits to the total integrated intensity of the [ c  i ] emission lines , we assumed velocity widths of 3 and 1 km s@xmath14 for lkca 15 and tw hya , respectively , the values obtained by single dish co observations @xcite . 
 significant [ c  i ] emission toward the pss l1551 irs 5 and hl tau was detected , as shown in figure [ fig : spec_ps ] . 
 the spectral profiles are single - peaked at values close to their systemic velocities . 
 the emission intensities are markedly higher than that of dm tau . 
 emission in the co @xmath3=43 line was detected toward and . 
 the peak velocities and line profiles are in good agreement with those of high-@xmath3 co spectra @xcite . 
 the double - peaked profile of dm tau lies close to the systemic velocity . after correcting for the beam size and efficiency , 
 the integrated intensity of co emission from tw hya was comparable to the marginal value reported by @xcite within the uncertainties . 
 we derived the optical depth of the [ c  i ] emission and thus the c column density using the equations reported by @xcite . 
 the optical depth at the peak velocity , @xmath34}$ ] , is given by @xmath35 } = -\ln \biggr ( 1- \frac{t_\mathrm{a}^\ast/\eta_\mathrm{mb}}{f_\mathrm{disk } [ j(t_\mathrm{ex } ) - j(t_\mathrm{bg } ) ] } \biggl ) \mathrm{,}\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the beam filling factor of the source , @xmath37 is the excitation temperature , @xmath38 is the temperature of the cosmic background radiation , and @xmath3 is the radiation temperature defined by @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the planck constant , @xmath41 is the observed frequency , and @xmath42 is the boltzmann constant . 
 the factor @xmath36 was derived from the ratio of the solid angle of the disk to that of the telescope s beam , @xmath43 . 
 the solid angle @xmath44 was estimated by assuming that the extent of the [ c  i ] emission is identical to that of the resolved co disk @xcite . 
 the outer radius of the co disk and its inclination angle , in addition to the estimated @xmath36 , are listed in table [ tab : info ] . 
 we employed @xmath45 for the pss because they were expected to be embedded in extended envelopes that extend over the beam area . for the ttss 
 , we assumed a constant @xmath37 of 50 k , as suggested by theoretical studies of protoplanetary disks around typical t tauri stars that predict the c@xmath8/c / co transition layer to appear at regions with @xmath46 k @xcite . 
 conversely , we assumed @xmath47 k for the pss , which is the accepted value for [ c  i ] observations of a ps surrounded by an infalling envelope @xcite .    assuming that local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) applies , we derived the averaged c column density over the source via @xmath48^{-1 } \frac{\tau_\mathrm{[c~i]}}{1-\exp(-\tau_\mathrm{[c~i ] } ) } f_\mathrm{disk}^{-1 } \ \ \ \mathrm{.}\end{aligned}\ ] ] here

 it should be noted that we assumed the optically thin condition ( @xmath34}\ll1 $ ] ) for lkca 15 and tw hya because no [ c  i ] emission was detected . 
 the c column density so estimated are listed in table [ tab : quantity_ci ] . 
 the total mass of atomic carbon , @xmath7(c ) , was derived by integrating the column density over the solid angle of the source . 
 @xmath7(c ) in the telescope beam can be uniquely determined regardless of source distribution .    table [ tab : quantity_ci ] clearly shows that all the detected [ c  i ] emission lines are optically thin . 
 the estimated c column density of the ttss is typically @xmath53 @xmath5 or less , whereas that of the ps is one order of magnitude higher ( @xmath6 @xmath5 ) . 
 accordingly , the @xmath7(c ) values of the t tauri star targets are one order of magnitude smaller than those of the pss . these results can be attributed to the lack of dense envelopes around the ttss . 
 the [ c  i ] emission detected from dm tau is most likely associated with the rotating gas disk around the star . 
 the peak velocity and full width half maximum are consistent with those of the disk in molecular lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ) . because of the modest upper energy of the ground state atomic c fine structure line ( @xmath54 k ) , the [ c  i ] emission is likely to be weighted toward the emission from the outer most part of the disk due to beam dilution 
 in fact , the detected [ c  i ] emission shows a single - peaked profile near the systemic velocity , suggesting that the emission may dominate at the region where the rotation velocity is small , i.e. , the outer part of the disk if keplerian rotation applies . 
 in addition , the fact that the total mass of c is one order of magnitude smaller than those of the pss ( table [ tab : quantity_ci ] ) supports the disk origin of the [ c  i ] emission . 
 however , the actual nature of the [ c  i ] emission of dm tau remains unclear due to the large hpbw of the telescope . 
 high - resolution observations are required to reveal the detailed spatial distribution of the [ c  i ] emission over the disk . 
 the estimated [ c  i ] intensity of dm tau is consistent with theoretical models of protoplanetary disk chemistry . 
 @xcite , for example , calculated the [ c  i ] line intensity of a t tauri star with a massive disk of 0.07 @xmath55 through a self - consistent treatment of the pdr near the disk surface . 
 the resultant peak intensity is expected to be @xmath560.1 k in @xmath57 after correcting for the aste beam size and the distance to the source , which is comparable to our observed intensity . 
 the higher intensities of the pss than those of the ttss suggest that the atomic carbon line originates mainly from the envelopes . 
 because the velocity width of the [ c  i ] emission is much narrower than that of the wing emission of a molecular outflow ( @xmath58 km s@xmath14 ) , the high velocity outflow is unlikely to affect the [ c  i ] emission @xcite . 
 there is a possibility of a low velocity cavity wall swept up by the outflow . 
 high - resolution [ c  i ] observations are required to separate the envelope from such a low velocity entrainment component . 
 we introduce the total mass ratio of atomic c to dust grains , @xmath7(c)/@xmath7(dust)@xmath59 ) , to investigate the evolutional variation of m(c ) . 
 the dust mass , which is generally estimated by optically thin ( sub-)millimeter continuum observations , reflects the total gas mass of the system if the gas - to - dust ratio is constant . 
 therefore , @xmath60 is an indicator of a fraction of c with respect to the total amount of gas , which is described as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the gas - to - dust ratio , and @xmath63 is the fractional abundance of c with respect to h@xmath9 . it is important to state that , especially for a protoplanetary disk , the atomic c and the dust grains trace distinct vertical layers of the disk ; the atomic c presumably exists in the disk near - surface layers while the dust grains are mainly at the disk midplane . 
 therefore , @xmath60 practically indicates the mass of c near the pdr with respect to the total mass . 
 we compiled @xmath7(dust ) from previous studies , as listed in table [ tab : info ] . 
 all @xmath7(dust ) data , except that for tw hya , were calculated from the total masses in @xcite , who measured ( sub-)millimeter flux densities with single dish telescopes . 
 their beam sizes were typically @xmath561015@xmath64 , which is comparable to that of our [ c  i ] observations . 
 these authors estimated the total ( gas+dust ) disk mass by a simple disk model with power - law density and temperature profiles under an assumed gas - to - dust ratio of 100 . in table 
 [ tab : info ] , we show the dust mass after correcting for the assumed gas - to - dust ratio . for tw hya , we took the mass estimate from @xcite , who also used a similar simple disk model to estimate the disk mass . 
 although their observations were made with an interferometer , the flux density of the entire disk was correctly recovered because the disk size is comparable to the detectable scale mentioned in @xcite . 
 the derived @xmath60 is listed in table [ tab : quantity_ci ] . a clear difference in @xmath60 is apparent between the ttss and pss ; @xmath60 is typically an order of @xmath65 or less for the ttss , whereas the pss show @xmath66 , on average . it should be noted that these results are not significantly affected by the difference in the assumed value of @xmath37 . if we use @xmath6750 k for the pss , which is the same value as in the ttss , we obtain @xmath68 , on average , a value still significantly higher than that for the tts values . 
 when @xmath6710 k , a typical value in molecular cloud cores , the difference was more noticeable . 
 as defined above , the decrement of @xmath60 can be interpreted by either a reduced @xmath63 or @xmath62 . 
 the former case means that @xmath69(c ) decreases as star formation progresses . 
 the chemical lifetime of c has been theoretically predicted to drop substantially with increments in the gas density @xcite . because the gas density significantly increases from a tenuous protostellar envelope to a dense disk near a tts 
 , a reduction in @xmath63 is expected at the tts stage . 
 in fact , the typical density at the disk midplane is estimated to be @xmath70 @xmath71 at 100 au if we assume the minimum mass solar nebula @xcite , whereas the typical density of the pss is @xmath72 @xmath71 @xcite . 
 if the reduced @xmath62 is the case , the gas in the disk must be depleted to a low level of @xmath73 to explain the @xmath60 decrement of at least one order of magnitude . 
 however , such a high depletion of overall gas is not expected to occur in the disk , as discussed in  [ sec:4 - 3 ] . 
 only upper limits were obtained for the [ c  i ] emission from lkca 15 and tw hya , despite the fact that they also have disks as massive as that of dm tau . 
 one possible explanation is that overall gas depletion with disk evolution leads to a depletion of c. since all the targets are in the evolutional stage of a so - called transitional disk , their disks are expected to be evolved with respect to a filled disk @xcite . 
 moreover , their advanced stellar ages imply that the disks of lkca 15 and tw hya are older than the dm tau disk . 
 the actual gas mass is difficult to directly estimate because of the large optical depths of molecular lines . 
 some modeling efforts by using co data indicate a lower gas - to - dust ratio with respect to the standard interstellar value @xcite . however , as mentioned in  [ sec:4 - 2 ] , the gas mass estimation for tw hya by an hd line emission , which is believed to be a good tracer of gas mass , indicates that the disk is massive so that the gas - to - dust ratio is comparable to the standard interstellar value @xcite . taking into account the fact that the disk model with a nominal gas - to - dust ratio of 100 reproduces well the observed intensity @xcite , an overall gas depletion is unlikely the case . 
 an alternative is the depletion of volatiles such as c - containing species at the surface with disk evolution . 
 such a time - dependent sink mechanism of c is proposed based on the observational data of hd and co isotopologue lines @xcite .

46,"in nature , there exists a variety of systems that involve chemical reactions . 
 some are on a geographical - scale , while others on a nano - scale . 
 chemical reactions are an integral part of life , including all living forms of life .    to study the dynamics of reaction systems , we often adopt rate equations in order to observe the change in chemical concentrations . in rate equations , we regard the concentrations as continuous variables ; the rate of the reaction as a function of the concentrations . in macroscopic systems , 
 there are a vast number of molecules ; thus , continuous representations are usually applicable 
 .    when the concentration of a certain chemical is small , fluctuations in the reactions or flow can be significant . 
 we often handle such systems with the help of stochastic differential equations , in which we regard noise as a continuum description of the fluctuations @xcite . 
 such an approximation is useful when the number of molecules is intermediate . 
 the employment of stochastic differential equations led to some important discoveries such as noise - induced order @xcite , noise - induced phase transitions @xcite , and stochastic resonance @xcite .    in stochastic differential equations , 
 still quantities of chemicals are regarded as continuous variables . 
 essentially , on a microscopic level , chemicals are composed of molecules . 
 the number of molecules should be an integer ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , which changes discretely . 
 fluctuations are derivatives of discrete stochastic changes ; thus , continuum descriptions of fluctuations are not always appropriate and can be doubted . for chemicals with a small number of molecules of the order of @xmath1 , 
 a single molecule is extremely significant ; therefore , the discreteness in the number is significant . 
 biological cells appear to be a good example . 
 the size of the cells is of the order of microns , in which nano - scale `` quantum '' effects can be ignored . 
 however , in cells , some chemicals act at extremely low concentrations of the order of pm or nm . 
 assuming that the typical volume of a cell ranges from @xmath1 to @xmath4 @xmath5 , the concentration of one molecule in the cell volume corresponds to @xmath6 pm@xmath6 nm . 
 it is probable that the molecular numbers of some chemicals in a cell are of the order of @xmath1 , or sometimes reach @xmath0 . 
 if such chemicals play only a minor role , we can safely ignore these chemicals . 
 however , this is not always the case . in biological systems , chemical species with a small number of molecules may critically affect the behavior of the entire system . 
 for example , there exist only one or a few copies of genetic molecules such as dna , which are important to characterize the behavior , in each cell . 
 further , some experiments show that doses of particular chemicals at concentrations of the order of pm or fm may alter the behavior of the cells ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 biological systems also include positive - feedback mechanisms such as autocatalytic reactions , which may amplify single molecular changes to a macroscopic level . 
 the effects due to small molecular numbers in cells have been noticed only recently , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .    at present , we focus on the possible effects of molecular discreteness . to study such effects , we should adopt an appropriate method to handle molecular discreteness . 
 some numerical methods to investigate reaction systems that take into account discreteness and stochasticity already exist ( we briefly review these methods ; see appendix ) . among the methods , we adopted gillespie s direct method , which is popular and frequently used . 
 furthermore , some works related to molecular discreteness also exist . 
 for example , blumenfeld et al . showed that the mass action law may breakdown in a small system @xcite . 
 stange et al . studied the synchronization of the turnover cycle of enzymes @xcite . 
 we regard it important to identify the phenomena for which molecular discreteness is essential .    through stochastic simulations , 
 we show that discreteness can induce transitions to novel states in autocatalytic systems @xcite , which may affect macroscopic chemical concentrations @xcite . 
 we consider a simple autocatalytic network ( loop ) with @xmath7 chemicals . 
 we consider @xmath8 chemicals and assume @xmath9 reactions between these chemicals ( @xmath10 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath7 ; @xmath11 ) . 
 all the reactions are irreversible . for the reactor , we assume a well - stirred container with volume @xmath12 . 
 the set of @xmath13 , the number of @xmath8 molecules , determines the state of the system . 
 the container is in contact with a chemical reservoir , in which the concentration of @xmath8 is fixed at @xmath14 . 
 the flow rate of @xmath8 between the container and the reservoir is @xmath15 , which corresponds to the probability of the flowing out of a molecule per time unit is the diffusion rate across the surface of the container . here , 
 we choose the flow proportional to @xmath12 , to have a well - defined continuum limit . 
 one might assume the flow proportional to @xmath16 , considering the area of the surface . by rescaling @xmath17 , 
 the model can be rewritten into the case with @xmath16 for finite @xmath12 . ] . 
 we can consider the continuum limit as @xmath18 . in the continuum limit 
 , the change of @xmath19 , the chemical concentration @xmath8 in the container , follows the rate equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the rate constant of the reaction @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .    for simplicity 
 , we consider the case with equivalent chemical species , given as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 for all @xmath27 ( @xmath28 , @xmath17 , @xmath29 ) . by this assumption 
 , the rate equation has only one attractor : a stable fixed point @xmath30 for all @xmath27 . for any initial condition 
 , each @xmath19 converges to @xmath31 , the fixed point value . around the fixed point , 
 @xmath19 vibrates with the frequency @xmath32 . 
 if the number of molecules is finite but fairly large , we can estimate the dynamical behavior of the system using a langevin equation , obtained by adding a noise term to the rate equation . 
 each concentration @xmath19 fluctuates and vibrates around the fixed point . 
 an increase in the noise ( corresponding to a decrease in the number of molecules ) merely boosts the fluctuation . 
 however , when the number of molecules is small , the behavior of the system is completely different . 
 first , we investigate the case when @xmath33 , which is the smallest number of species to show the novel states described below . 
 subsequently , we investigate the dynamical behavior of the system with a small number of molecules . in order to detect the phenomena for which the discreteness of the number of molecules is crucial , we employ stochastic simulations .    here , 
 we adopt gillespie s direct method . 
 the frequency ( expected number per unit time )    * of the reaction @xmath22 is @xmath34 ; * of the outflow of @xmath8 is @xmath35 ; * of the inflow of @xmath8 is @xmath36 .    in the continuum limit ( @xmath18 ) , these frequencies agree with the rate equation . 
 we calculate these frequencies with the current @xmath13 , and stochastically decide when and which event will occur next .    in this case , by an appropriate conversion of @xmath17 , @xmath12 , and @xmath37 , we can set @xmath28 and @xmath31 to be @xmath1 without loss of the generality ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the only independent parameters ) . 
 we assume that @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the purpose of further discussion . 
 the total number of molecules in the container , @xmath42 , is approximately @xmath43 on an average . by varying @xmath12 
 , we can control the average number of molecules without changing the continuum limit . 
 first , we consider the case of a large @xmath12 , i.e. , both the number of molecules in the container and flow of molecules between the container and the reservoir are large . 
 as expected , the behavior of the system is similar to that of the rate equation with noise . as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : a-512 ] , each @xmath13 fluctuates and vibrates around the fixed point value @xmath44 ( i.e. @xmath45 ) . 
 this is still in the realm of stochastic differential equations . 
 however , when @xmath12 is small , we observe novel states that do not exist in the continuum limit . as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : a-032 ] , continuous vibrations disappear . 
 furthermore , two chemicals are dominant and the other two are mostly extinct ( @xmath46 ) . in fig . 
 [ fig : a-032 ] , at @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 dominate the system and @xmath50 for the most part . 
 we call such a state the 1 - 3 rich state . 
 reversely , at @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are large and usually @xmath54 . 
 we call this state the 2 - 4 rich state . 
 these states appear because of the following reason . in this system 
 , the production of @xmath8 molecules requires at least one @xmath8 molecule as a catalyst . if @xmath8 becomes extinct , the production of @xmath8 halts . 
 @xmath13 never regains before an @xmath8 molecule flows in .    in the rate equation ( eq . 
 ( [ eqn : tr1-rate ] ) ) , the concentration @xmath19 is a continuous variable , which can be an infinitesimal but positive value . 
 the consumption rate of @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath19 itself ; thus , @xmath19 can not reach @xmath0 exactly within finite time , even if it can go to @xmath0 asymptotically as @xmath55 . 
 in fact , the number of molecules must be an integer . 
 transitions from @xmath56 to @xmath46 are probabilistic and may happen in finite time . for transitions to occur 
 , it is important that the consumption rate of @xmath19 does not converge to @xmath0 at @xmath57 . 
 the average interval of a molecule flowing in is @xmath58 for each chemical . 
 if @xmath17 and @xmath12 are small enough to ensure that the inflow interval is longer than the time scale of the reactions , it is likely that the state of the system @xmath56 drops to @xmath46 before an @xmath8 molecule enters .    when @xmath13 reaches @xmath0 , @xmath59 is also likely to become @xmath0 . 
 for example , if we assume that @xmath60 , then @xmath48 is likely to increase because the consumption of @xmath61 halts ; @xmath49 is likely to decrease because the production of @xmath62 halts . 
 thus , this results in @xmath63 . when @xmath63 , the consumption rate of @xmath64 is larger than the production rate of @xmath64 ; therefore , @xmath53 starts to decrease and often reaches @xmath0 . 
 when @xmath50 , all the reactions stop . 
 the system stays at @xmath50 for a long time as compared with the ordinary time scale of the reactions ( @xmath65 ) . 
 this is the 1 - 3 rich state .    in the 1 - 3 rich state 
 , the system alternately switches between @xmath63 and @xmath66 . 
 we consider that the system is in the 1 - 3 rich state with @xmath63 . 
 one @xmath67 molecule flowing in may resume the reactions @xmath68 and @xmath69 . 
 generally , the former is faster because @xmath63 ; hence , @xmath52 is likely to increase . since @xmath53 = 0 , the reactions are one - way ; @xmath48 decreases and @xmath49 increases . when @xmath66 , @xmath52 starts to decrease . 
 finally , when @xmath52 returns to @xmath0 , the reactions halt again . 
 the system stays in the 1 - 3 rich state , until @xmath48 reaches @xmath0 . in the same manner , 
 the inflow of @xmath64 can switch the system from @xmath66 to @xmath63 in the 1 - 3 rich state . 
 consequently , we observe successive switching between @xmath63 and @xmath66 . in the 2 - 4 rich state , 
 the system switches between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    in this manner 
 , even one molecule can switch the system within the 1 - 3 or 2 - 4 rich states . 
 we name these states `` switching states '' . 
 now , we investigate some properties of the switching states . 
 we introduce an index @xmath72 as a characteristic of the switching states . around the fixed point of the rate equation , @xmath73 ; in the 1 - 3 rich state , @xmath74 ; in the 2 - 4 rich state , @xmath75 .    the distribution of @xmath76 is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : a - ac - bd ] . when @xmath77 , a single peak appears around @xmath78 , which corresponds to the fixed point . by decreasing @xmath12 , 
 the peak broadens with fluctuations . 
 when @xmath79 , double peaks appear at @xmath80 , which correspond to the switching states . 
 we clearly observe a symmetry - breaking transition between a continuous vibration around the fixed point with large @xmath12 and the switching states with small @xmath12 . 
 this is a discreteness - induced transition ( dit ) that occurs with decrease of @xmath12 , which is not seen in continuum descriptions . 
 we introduce another index @xmath81 , which represents the difference in concentrations : @xmath82 in the 1 - 3 rich state and @xmath83 in the 2 - 4 rich state . the distribution of @xmath84 is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : a - ab - cd ] . 
 there are double peaks around @xmath85 , which imply large imbalances , such as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , between @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the 1 - 3 rich state ( as well as the 2 - 4 rich state ) . 
 we investigate some properties of the switching states . 
 first , we examine how each @xmath13 changes in a switching event . 
 we assume the 1 - 3 rich state with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . here , one @xmath67 molecule flows in ( @xmath91 ) at @xmath92 , which starts up the reactions . assuming that @xmath93 is so small that no more molecules flow in or out throughout the switching , the total number of molecules @xmath94 is conserved at @xmath95 , and @xmath53 is always @xmath0 . 
 we can represent the state with two variables , @xmath48 and @xmath52 .    in this system , 
 only the following types of reactions    * @xmath96 and * @xmath97    may change @xmath13 ; the others never take place . @xmath48 
 monotonously decreases . when @xmath52 reaches @xmath0 , these reactions halt completely , and the switching is completed . evidently , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the final values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . 
 the frequency of the reaction @xmath96 is @xmath101 and that of @xmath97 is @xmath102 we obtain the master equation @xmath103 for @xmath104 , the probability of residence in the state @xmath105 at time @xmath37 . 
 the initial condition is @xmath106 ; otherwise @xmath107 . 
 we can easily follow the master equation numerically . 
 we investigate the relationship between the initial state @xmath108 and the final state @xmath109 .    if the first reaction is @xmath97 , @xmath52 instantaneously reaches @xmath0 , and as a result @xmath110 . the system fails to switch . 
 if @xmath111 , it is more probable that the first reaction is @xmath96 . 
 subsequently , the system carries out further reactions . in this case , it is probable that @xmath112 , i.e. , the system swaps @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : a - swprob-128 ] . 
 consequently , we observe successive switching ( as seen in fig . 
 [ fig : a-032 ] ) .    when @xmath113 , the system is likely to reach @xmath114 and break the 1 - 3 rich state . a large imbalance between @xmath48 and @xmath49 results in an unstable 1 - 3 rich state . 
 now , we investigate the requirements for the transitions to the switching states . the rate of residence of the switching states for several @xmath17 and @xmath12 is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : a - type1a ] . for approximately @xmath115 
 , we observe the switching states . 
 if @xmath116 , the system mostly stays in the switching states . 
 subsequently , we expect that switching states appear even for large @xmath12 if @xmath17 is very small . 
 in fact , we observe switching states for @xmath117 as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : a-10000 ] . 
 furthermore , in this case also , a single molecule can induce switching .    strictly speaking , 
 if @xmath93 is the same , the rate of residence is a little smaller for larger @xmath12 . 
 if @xmath12 is large , the system takes longer to reach @xmath46 even if the rate of reaction and the initial concentrations are the same . 
 thus , it is less likely to exhibit switching states for the same interval of the inflow , @xmath58 .    in general , some reactions are much faster than the inflow . 
 if the number of molecules which enter within the time scale of the reactions is of the order of @xmath1 for a certain chemical , the reactions may consume all the molecules of the chemical , and the molecular discreteness of the chemical becomes significant . 
 in other words , for the effect of the discreteness to appear in a system with several processes , it is important that the number of events of a process within the time scale of another process is of the order of @xmath1 . 
 once the system is in the switching state , it is fairly stable and difficult to escape , especially if @xmath93 is small . to escape the 1 - 3 rich state and regain continuous vibration , at least one @xmath67 molecule and one @xmath64 molecule should flow in and 
 it is required that after an @xmath67 molecule flows in , an @xmath64 molecule should flow in before @xmath52 returns to @xmath0 , or vice versa . 
 we put one @xmath67 molecule into the system in the 1 - 3 rich state at @xmath92 , and one @xmath64 molecule in at @xmath118 . 
 we assume that @xmath93 is so small that no more molecules flow in or out . 
 then , we judge whether the system escapes from the 1 - 3 rich state . 
 in due course , the system returns to the 1 - 3 rich ( or sometimes 2 - 4 rich ) state because there is no further flow ; thus , we should judge at the right moment . here , 
 if @xmath119 for all @xmath27 at @xmath120 ( i.e. , waiting about 2.5 times longer than the period of the oscillation around the fixed point ) , we consider that the 1 - 3 rich state has been interrupted . 
 we measure the probability of interruption for various initial conditions and the delay @xmath121 as shown in fig . [ 
 fig : a - sw3b-32 ] . 
 the system requires adequate timing of inflow to escape the switching states , which may amplify the imbalance between the stability of each state . 
 for example , to escape the 1 - 3 rich , @xmath63 state , it is required that an @xmath67 molecule flows in , and then an @xmath64 molecule flows in with a certain delay @xmath121 , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : a - sw3b-32 ] . 
 thus , the frequency of escape from the 1 - 3 rich state is approximately proportional to the product of the inflow frequencies of @xmath67 and @xmath64 . 
 if each @xmath15 or @xmath14 is species - dependent , the stability of the 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 rich states may strongly depend on @xmath122 , the inflow frequency of @xmath8 . 
 furthermore , if at the outset @xmath123 , it is difficult for the system to escape from the 1 - 3 rich state . in some cases where the parameters are species - dependent , the flows or the switching may lead to @xmath123 , which stabilizes the 1 - 3 rich state . 
 these conditions are important to stabilize particular states and affect the macroscopic behavior of the system ( see section [ sect : tr2 ] ) . 
 to close the section [ sect : tr1 ] , we briefly discuss the cases where @xmath124 . 
 figure [ fig : a - k356 - 16 ] shows the time series of each @xmath13 for @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 . when @xmath128 , 1 - 3 - 5 rich and 2 - 4 - 6 rich states appear . 
 however , these states are less stable than the 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 rich states for @xmath33 . 
 these states collapse when any of the rich chemicals vanish ; thus , they are unstable for large @xmath7 . 
 when @xmath7 is odd ( @xmath129 , @xmath126 , @xmath3 ) , there are no stable states where particular chemicals are extinct . however , additional reactions , or a variety of @xmath21 or @xmath14 , may stabilize or destabilize the states such that it is not always true that loops with odd-@xmath7 are unstable . 
 the discreteness - induced transitions are not limited in the autocatalytic loop . 
 we apply the abovementioned discussions to certain segments of a complicated reaction network with a slight modification . 
 in the preceding section , we show that the discreteness of the molecules can induce transitions to novel `` switching '' states in autocatalytic systems .    for the case where @xmath33 with uniform parameters , the 1 - 3 rich state and the 2 - 4 rich state are equivalent . in due course , the system alternates between the 1 - 3 rich and 2 - 4 rich states . 
 the long - term averaged concentrations are still the same as the continuum limit value , @xmath130 
 .    it will be important if macroscopic properties , such as the average concentrations , can be altered . 
 we show that the discreteness - induced transitions may alter the long - term averaged concentrations . 
 once again , here , we adopt the autocatalytic reaction loop @xmath9 for the @xmath33 species . 
 now we consider the case where the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath14 , or @xmath21 are species - dependent . in the continuum limit 
 , the concentration @xmath19 is governed by the rate equation @xmath131 the rate equation does not contain the volume @xmath12 ; hence , the average concentrations should be independent of @xmath12 .    as discussed in the preceding section , for the transitions to the switching states to occur , it is necessary that the interval of the inflow is longer than the time scale of the reactions . in this model , 
 the inflow interval of @xmath8 is @xmath132 , and the time scale of the reaction @xmath22 in order to use @xmath8 up is @xmath133 . if all the chemicals are equivalent , the discreteness of all the chemicals equally take effect , and the 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 rich states coordinately appear at @xmath134 . 
 now , since the parameters are species - dependent , the effect of discreteness may be different for each species . 
 for example , assuming that @xmath135 , the inflow interval of @xmath61 is longer than that of @xmath67 . 
 thus , the discreteness of the inflow of @xmath61 may be significant for larger @xmath12 .    to demonstrate a possible effect of the discreteness on the macroscopic properties of the system 
 , we measure each average concentration @xmath136 , sampled over a long enough time to allow transitions between the 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 rich states , by gillespie s direct method . 
 note that every @xmath136 does not depend on @xmath12 in the continuum limit . 
 generally , in discrete simulations , the effect of the discreteness varies with @xmath12 and alters every @xmath136 . 
 when @xmath12 is very large , the discreteness does not matter and @xmath136 is almost equal to the continuum limit value . in contrast , 
 when @xmath12 is small , the discreteness causes @xmath136 to be very different from the continuum limit . 
 we first investigate the case where each @xmath14 is species - dependent ( i.e. , each inflow rate is species - dependent ) , and each @xmath15 and @xmath21 are uniform ( @xmath25 , @xmath137 ) . 
 later , we briefly discuss the case where @xmath21 is inhomogeneous . 
 as mentioned in section [ subsect : tr1-cond ] , for the effect of the discreteness to appear , it is important that the interval of events of a process is of the order of or longer than the time scale of another process . as regards the inflow , 
 there are two indices to determine how the discreteness appears :    * the inflow interval , @xmath138 , * the number of molecules at equilibrium , @xmath139 . 
 if the inflow interval , @xmath138 , is longer than the time scale of the reactions , the reactions may exhaust the chemical before the chemical enters , and the inflow discreteness becomes significant . 
 furthermore , if @xmath139 is smaller than @xmath1 , @xmath13 can reach @xmath0 because of the outflow . 
 in such cases , the relation between the inflow interval and the outflow time scale is also important . 
 the approach time from @xmath140 to @xmath46 is of the order of @xmath141 . 
 if the inflow interval of the chemical that causes the switching to raise @xmath13 is long enough to allow all @xmath8 molecules to flow out , the inflow discreteness may alter the stability of the states drastically . 
 from this point of view , we classify the mechanism in cases i , i@xmath142 , and ii as follows . 
 we start with the simplest case , @xmath143 . in this case 
 , the rate equation has a stable fixed point with @xmath144 . 
 when @xmath12 is large , each @xmath19 fluctuates around the fixed point , and each average concentration @xmath136 is in accordance with the fixed point value . 
 when @xmath12 is small , @xmath136 depends on @xmath12 . 
 [ fig : tr2-average1 ] shows each @xmath136 as a function of @xmath12 . the difference between @xmath145 and @xmath146 increases for small @xmath12 .    by decreasing @xmath12 , first @xmath52 and @xmath53 reach @xmath0 and 
 the 1 - 3 rich state appears . to reach @xmath147 or @xmath148 , the inflow interval of @xmath67 or @xmath64 
 should be longer than the time scale of the reactions . 
 we set @xmath149 ; thus , the condition to achieve the 1 - 3 rich state is approximately @xmath150 , @xmath151 ; that for the 2 - 4 rich state is @xmath152 , @xmath153 . 
 if @xmath12 satisfies @xmath152 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , the 1 - 3 rich state appears but the 2 - 4 rich state does not . 
 thus , @xmath145 and @xmath156 increase . 
 we actually observed this at @xmath157 , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : tr2-average1 ] .    for smaller @xmath12 that fulfills both the 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 rich states , the imbalance between the 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 rich states does not disappear 
 once the system is in the 1 - 3 rich state , adequate timing for the @xmath67 and @xmath64 inflow is required to escape the state . 
 thus , the frequency of escape from the 1 - 3 rich state is approximately proportional to @xmath158 , the product of the inflow frequencies of @xmath67 and @xmath64 . 
 the average residence time in the 1 - 3 rich state as well as the 2 - 4 rich state is the reciprocal of the escape frequency . 
 the ratio of the average residence time in the 1 - 3 rich state to that in the 2 - 4 rich state is @xmath159 . 
 in addition , after escaping the switching states , the system tends to reach the 1 - 3 rich state rather than the 2 - 4 rich state because of the biased inflow . 
 thus , the ratio of the total residence time in the 1 - 3 rich state to that of the 2 - 4 rich state is larger than @xmath160 ; hence , @xmath145 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , even for a small difference in @xmath14 .      in case 
 i , we consider the imbalance between the @xmath61 , @xmath62 pair and the @xmath67 , @xmath64 pair . 
 if another imbalance exists between the @xmath67 and @xmath64 inflows , the switching induced by these chemicals in the 1 - 3 rich state may be unbalanced . 
 we consider the case where @xmath163 .    in this case , the 1 - 3 rich state is more stable than the 2 - 4 rich state , which is identical to case i. in the 1 - 3 rich state , the system can be switched from @xmath63 to @xmath66 by an @xmath67 molecule ; and from @xmath66 to @xmath63 by an @xmath64 molecule . 
 now , the inflow rate of @xmath67 is larger than @xmath64 ; thus , switching from @xmath63 to @xmath66 is more probable than vice versa , and the system tends to stay in the @xmath66 state . 
 consequently , @xmath164 , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : tr2-average1 ] . 
 this effect requires switching states . 
 when @xmath12 is large , @xmath145 and @xmath156 are almost the same .      here , we consider the case where @xmath165 . in this case 
 also , the rate equation has a stable fixed point , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , @xmath169 . ] . 
 when @xmath12 is small , both the 1 - 3 and the 2 - 4 rich states appear . here , we consider @xmath170 , the number of @xmath64 molecules when the concentration of @xmath64 in the container and in the reservoir are at equilibrium . if @xmath171 , @xmath53 reaches @xmath0 without undergoing any reaction . 
 the system takes @xmath172 time units to reach from @xmath173 to @xmath148 . 
 the reaction @xmath174 also uses @xmath64 such that @xmath53 decreases faster if @xmath175 is large . 
 if @xmath176 , the inflow of @xmath62 may switch from @xmath70 to @xmath71 and raise @xmath53 again . 
 the inflow interval of @xmath62 is @xmath177 . 
 if the interval is much shorter than the approach time to @xmath148 , the switching maintains @xmath176 . 
 if the interval is longer , @xmath53 reaches @xmath0 before switching , and the 2 - 4 rich state is easily destroyed . 
 in the 1 - 3 rich state , the system tends to maintain @xmath66 because the @xmath67 inflow is frequent . 
 however , the @xmath61 inflow is also large enough to maintain @xmath178 . 
 the 1 - 3 rich state retains its stability .    in conclusion , 
 the 1 - 3 rich state is more stable than the 2 - 4 rich state . in the 1 - 3 rich state , 
 @xmath66 is preferred , and @xmath156 increases . at this stage , it is possible that @xmath179 despite the fact that @xmath180 , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : tr2-average2 ] .      in summary , 
 the difference in the `` extent of discreteness '' between chemical species induces novel transitions . 
 the `` extent of discreteness '' depends on @xmath12 ; thus , we observe transitions by changing @xmath12 . 
 the transition reported in section [ sect : tr1 ] is regarded as a _ 
 second order _ transition involving symmetry breaking ( see figs . [ 
 fig : a - ac - bd ] and [ fig : a - ab - cd ] ) , while the transition in this section corresponds to the _ first order _ transition without symmetry breaking ( see fig . 
 [ fig : tr2-dist - ab - cd - casei ] ) in terms of thermodynamics . 
 we classified the mechanism in cases i , i@xmath142 , and ii . 
 these mechanisms can be combined . 
 for example , we demonstrate the case where @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 . in this case 
 , each @xmath136 shows a three - step change with @xmath12 , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : tr2-average3 ] .    when @xmath12 is large , @xmath145 , @xmath184 , @xmath162 , since @xmath185 . at @xmath186 , 
 the discreteness of the @xmath62 inflow becomes significant , and the 2 - 4 rich state appears . in the 2 - 4 rich state , 
 the system tends to remain at @xmath70 because of the inflow imbalance between @xmath61 and @xmath62 , as observed in case i@xmath142 . 
 figure [ fig : tr2-dist - x2 ] shows the distribution of @xmath168 . 
 the major peak corresponds to the 2 - 4 rich , @xmath187 state for the cases when @xmath188 .    on the other hand , in the 2 - 4 rich state 
 , the outflow of @xmath64 depresses @xmath53 toward @xmath170 , as observed in fig . 
 [ fig : tr2-ts - amp ] . by decreasing @xmath12 , 
 the imbalance between @xmath52 and @xmath53 increases because the rate of switching , which again raises @xmath53 , decreases in proportion to @xmath12 . finally , at @xmath189 , the 2 - 4 rich state loses stability , as seen in case ii . 
 now , the 1 - 3 rich state is preferred despite the fact that @xmath185 . 
 @xmath156 increases to @xmath190 , which is more than @xmath191 times as large as that in the continuum limit .    for extremely small @xmath12 , 
 the 1 - 3 rich state is also unstable because @xmath48 and @xmath49 easily reach @xmath0 . 
 in such a situation , typically only one chemical species is in the container . 
 the system is dominated by diffusion , and @xmath146 increases again due to the large @xmath192 . 
 note that the chemical that becomes extinct depends not only on the flows but also on the reactions . in some cases , we observe smaller @xmath156 for larger @xmath193 . 
 it is possible that each @xmath21 varies with the species . in such cases 
 , we can discuss the effect of discreteness in a similar way . 
 however , the change of @xmath136 with @xmath12 is different from the case with asymmetric flows . 
 for example , we assume that @xmath194 and @xmath195 . in the continuum limit or in the case of large @xmath12 , @xmath196 , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : tr2-average - r ] . 
 in contrast , when @xmath12 is small , @xmath197 . 
 if @xmath12 is very small , such that the total number of molecules is mostly @xmath0 or @xmath1 , reactions rarely take place . 
 the flow of chemicals dominate the system ; thus , @xmath198 . 
 if both the reactions and the flows are species - dependent , we simply expect the behavior to be a combination of the abovementioned cases . 
 even this simple system can exhibit a multi - step change in concentrations along with a change in @xmath12 . 
 it is not limited to the simple reaction loop . 
 in fact , we observe this kind of change in concentrations with a change in the system size in randomly connected reaction networks . for 
 a large reaction network with multiple time scales of reactions and flows , the discreteness effect may exhibit behavior that is more complicated . our discussion is largely applicable to such cases if we can define the time scales appropriately . 
 as seen in this paper , the discreteness of molecules can alter the average concentrations . when the rates of inflow and/or the reaction are species - dependent , transitions between the discreteness - induced states are imbalanced . 
 this may alter the average concentrations drastically from those of the continuum limit case . 
 we demonstrated that molecular discreteness may induce transitions to novel states in autocatalytic systems , and that may result in an alteration of the macroscopic properties such as the average chemical concentrations .    in biochemical pathways , it is not anomalous that the number of molecules of a chemical is of the order of @xmath199 or less in a cell . 
 there are thousands of protein species , and the total number of protein molecules in a cell is not very large . for example , in signal transduction pathways , some chemicals work at less than @xmath200 molecules per cell . 
 there exist only one or a few copies of genetic molecules such as dna ; furthermore , mrnas and trnas are not present in large numbers . 
 thus , regulation mechanisms involving genes are quite stochastic . 
 molecular discreteness naturally concerns such rare chemicals . 
 one of the authors , kaneko , and yomo recently provided the `` minority control conjecture , '' which propounds that chemical species with a small number of molecules governs the behavior of a replicating system , which is related to the origin of heredity @xcite . 
 matsuura et al . experimentally demonstrated that a small number of genetic molecules is essential for evolution @xcite . 
 molecular discreteness should be significant for such chemicals , and may be relevant to characters of genetic molecules . 
 until now , we have modeled reactions in a well - stirred medium , where only the number of molecules is taken into account while determining the behavior . however , 
 if the system is not mixed well , we should take into account the diffusion in space . 
 both the total number of molecules and the spatial distributions of the molecules may be significant . from a biological point of view 
 , the diffusion in space is also important because the diffusion in cells is not always fast as compared with the time scales of the reactions . 
 if the reactions are faster than the mixing , we should consider the system as a reaction - diffusion one , with discrete molecules diffusing in space . 
 the relation between these time scales will be important , as indicated by mikhailov and hess @xcite . 
 as regards these time scales , we recently found that the spatial discreteness of molecules within the so - called kuramoto length @xcite , over which a molecule diffuses in its lifetime ( lapses before it undergoes reaction ) , may yield novel steady states that are not observed in the reaction - diffusion equations @xcite . 
 there is still room for exploration in this field , e.g. , pattern formation . 
 our result does not depend on the details of the reaction and may be applicable to systems beyond reactions , such as ecosystems or economic systems . 
 the inflow of chemicals in a reaction system can be seen as a model of intrusion or evolution in an ecosystem ; both systems with discrete agents ( molecules or individuals ) , which may become extinct . in this regard , our result is relevant to studies of ecosystems , e.g. , extinction dynamics with a replicator model by tokita and yasutomi @xcite 
 . the discreteness of agents or operations might also be relevant to some economic models , e.g. , artificial markets . 
 most mathematical methods that are applied to reaction systems can not account for the discreteness . 
 although the utility of simulations have become convenient with the progress of computer technology , it might be useful if we could construct a theoretical formulation applicable to discrete reaction systems . 
 on the other hand , in recent years , major advances have been made in the detection of a small number of molecules and fabrication of small reactors , which raises our hopes to demonstrate the effect of discreteness experimentally . 
 we believe that molecular discreteness is of hidden but real importance with respect to biological mechanisms , such as pattern formation , regulation of biochemical pathways , or evolution , to be pursued in the future .

 since the 1970s , several methods have been suggested for simulating discrete reaction systems . 
 we briefly review some of these methods : stochsim method , gillespie s methods , and their improved versions . 
 these methods are based on chemical master equations . in chemical master equations , 
 we define the state of the system as the number of molecules in each chemical ; the reaction process as a series of transitions between the states . 
 we consider each event , i.e. , a reaction event between molecules , inflow or outflow of a molecule , as a transition . 
 they take place stochastically with a certain frequency ( probability per time unit ) determined by the current state .    for the simulations used in this study , we adopted gillespie s direct method for simplicity . 
 we also attempted a direct simulation and the next reaction method , and confirmed that our result does not depend on the simulation method .        in this method , we fix the time step as @xmath201 . assuming that the frequency of the event-@xmath27 is @xmath202 , the average number of the event-@xmath27 for each step is @xmath203 . if @xmath204 , we approximately assume that at most one event occurs at each step , and the probability of the event-@xmath27 is @xmath203 ( it is possible that no event occurs in the step ) . 
 we select an event with a random number , change the state according to the event , and recalculate each @xmath202 . 
 the stochsim method adopts random sampling of molecules . for bimolecular reactions , we randomly choose two molecules from the system , and decide whether they react or not with certain probability . 
 the method requires three random numbers in total for each step . in case 
 there are some single molecular ( first - order ) reactions , we choose the second molecule from the molecules in the system and some pseudo - molecules ( dummies ) . 
 if the second molecule is a pseudo - molecule , then we select the single molecular reaction of the first molecule , and determine whether it occurs .    in the stochsim method , @xmath201 is restricted by the fastest reaction ( with the largest reaction rate per pair of molecules ) . 
 if most of the bimolecular pairs do not react with each other , or the reaction probability varies with the species , this method may be impractical because no reaction occurs in most steps 
 .      incidentally , if the system consists of discrete molecules , it is typical that each frequency @xmath202 changes only when an event actually occurs . taking this into account , 
 gillespie suggested two exact simulation methods : the direct method @xcite and the first reaction method @xcite . in these methods , we do not fix the time step . 
 instead , we calculate the time lapse until the next event .    in the direct method , first , we consider the total frequency of the events , @xmath205 . 
 if @xmath202 does not change until the next event , the time lapse until the next event , @xmath121 , is exponentially distributed as @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) . 
 we determine the time lapse @xmath121 with an exponentially distributed random number . 
 subsequently , the probability that the next event is @xmath27 is @xmath208 . 
 we determine which event occurs with a random number . 
 we then set the time @xmath37 forward by @xmath121 , update the state according to the event , and recalculate each frequency @xmath202 . 
 iterate the above steps until the designated time elapses . 
 the first reaction method is similar to the direct method . 
 it is based on the fact that @xmath209 , the time lapse until the next event-@xmath27 , is exponentially distributed as @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) . 
 only the event with minimum @xmath209 actually occurs . 
 we update the state , recalculate each @xmath202 , and generate all @xmath209 again with the new corresponding @xmath202 .    in the first reaction method 
 , we need as many random numbers each step as the types of events . 
 we calculate all @xmath209 , choose the earliest , and discard the others . 
 generally , the processor time to generate random numbers is very large ; hence , a large amount of time is wasted for several types of events .      to solve this performance problem , 
 gibson and bruck proposed a refinement of the first reaction method : next reaction method @xcite . 
 although , in general , monte carlo simulations require independency of random numbers , they proved a safe way of recycling random numbers , which drastically promotes efficiency .    in the next reaction method , we store @xmath212 , the absolute time when the next event-@xmath27 occurs , instead of @xmath209 
 in the first step , we have to calculate @xmath213 for every @xmath27 , according to the exponential distribution @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) . 
 we choose the event with the smallest @xmath212 . according to the event 
 , we set the time @xmath37 forward to @xmath212 , change the state , and recalculate each @xmath202 .      1 . 
 as regards the event just executed , we should recalculate @xmath214 with the exponential distribution of @xmath209 , identical to the first step . 
 as regards other events whose frequency @xmath202 has changed , we should recalculate the corresponding @xmath212 . 
 for such events , we convert @xmath212 as @xmath215 @xmath216 is the @xmath212 before the event and @xmath217 is that after the event . 
 + with this conversion , the actual frequency is adjusted from @xmath218 to @xmath219 , without using random numbers . 
 3 .   as for other events 
 whose frequency @xmath202 has not changed , we do not need to recalculate the corresponding @xmath212 . 
 if the event executed does not influence @xmath202 , we do not need to recalculate the concerned @xmath202 and @xmath212 ( except for those of the event just executed ) . 
 thus , it is useful to manage the dependency of @xmath202 on each event . with this intention 
 , we prepare a dependency graph that shows which @xmath202 should be updated after event-@xmath220 ( event-@xmath27 depends on event-@xmath220 ) . in a large reaction network , such as biochemical pathways , one chemical species can react with only a small part of the chemicals in the entire system . in such cases , 
 recalculation is not required for irrelevant chemical species ; hence , we can accelerate simulations with help of a dependency check . 
 it is also important to find the smallest @xmath212 quickly . for this purpose 
 , we use a heap , a binary tree in which each node is larger than or equal to its parent . 
 the root is the smallest at any instance ) sorting algorithm . 
 if only one @xmath212 has changed in the step , the cost of resorting is o(@xmath221 ) . ] .

 in this stage , @xmath13 can reach @xmath0 , and the switching states appear . in the 1 - 3 rich state , 
 the system successively switches between the @xmath63 and @xmath66 states . 
 the interval of switching is much longer than the period of continuous vibration ( @xmath229 ) observed in figs .

 , we show the distribution as a line graph for visibility . )

 when @xmath12 is large , there appears a single peak around @xmath237 , corresponding to the fixed point . 
 when @xmath12 is small and the system is in the switching states , the index @xmath84 shows an imbalance between the rich ( non - zero ) chemicals . for example , in the 1 - 3 rich state , @xmath84 corresponds to @xmath238 since @xmath90 for the most part .

47,"white dwarfs are the end points of all low- to intermediate - mass stars , which are the majority of stars in the universe . 
 they are dense stellar remnants composed of electron degenerate cores surrounded by non - degenerate envelopes . 
 these evolved stars provide key insight into galactic star formation and evolution .    to use white dwarfs as tracers of galactic evolution , we must determine their basic physical parameters , such as effective temperatures ( @xmath3 ) , surface gravities ( @xmath4 ) and masses . 
 more than 80percent of white dwarfs have hydrogen - rich atmospheres , known as da white dwarfs @xcite . 
 spectroscopy has been a successful tool in obtaining da atmospheric parameters , yet it only provides a view of the outermost layers of the white dwarf , and it is subject to systematic problems that require correction if the star is cooler than roughly @xmath5k and the surface is convective @xcite . 
 asteroseismology , however , can probe deep into the interior of a white dwarf and provide information on its composition , rotation period , magnetic field strength , mass , temperature and luminosity , by matching the observed non - radial @xmath6-mode pulsations to theoretical models ( see reviews by @xcite ) . 
 as white dwarfs cool , they pass through instability strips depending on their outermost envelope composition , which coincides with the onset of a partial ionization zone . 
 this zone efficiently drives pulsations , which cause periodic brightness variations of the white dwarf @xcite . the variable da white dwarfs ( davs ) , also known as zzceti stars , are the most commonly found and studied type of pulsating white dwarfs . 
 their effective temperatures range between @xmath7k for a typical mass of m @xmath8 0.6@xmath9 , with pulsation periods ranging from @xmath10s @xcite . 
 ground - based studies of zzceti stars have been carried out for decades , but very few have been observed long enough to resolve more than six pulsation modes . 
 crucially , there are potentially nine free parameters in the asteroseismic modeling of pulsating white dwarfs @xcite , which has required holding fixed many parameters in order to constrain the internal properties of zzcetis . 
 it is clear that fully constraining these free parameters and thus the internal white dwarf structure and evolution will require a larger sample of rich asteroseismic observations . 
 considerable effort has been expended to obtain uninterrupted photometry from coordinated , multi - site , ground - based campaigns to study pulsating white dwarfs , especially through the whole earth telescope @xcite , which has been operating for more than two decades ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the _ kepler _ planet - hunting spacecraft offers a unique opportunity to obtain high - quality , space - based light curves of variable stars , white dwarfs included . 
 unfortunately , few white dwarfs were known in the original _ kepler _ mission field , and only two pulsating white dwarfs were discovered within the first two years of the mission @xcite . in order to increase this sample , we began the search for all white dwarfs in the original field of the _ kepler _ mission , and more specifically any possible zzceti stars . 
 we created the _ kepler_-int survey ( kis , @xcite ) in order to select white dwarf candidates using colour - colour diagrams , and report on that search here .    in sections 
 [ selection ] and [ spec ] , we describe the selection method of our white dwarfs and present their spectroscopic observations . in section [ astero ] , we focus on the nine new pulsating white dwarfs . we conclude in section [ conclusion ] . 
 we selected our white dwarf candidates using @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 colour - colour diagrams using data from the _ kepler_-int survey ( kis ) , shown in fig . 
 [ fig : colours ] . 
 kis is a deep optical survey using the wide field camera on the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope ( int ) , taken through four broadband filters ( @xmath13 ) and one narrowband filter ( h@xmath14 ) , covering more than 97percent of the original _ kepler _ field down to @xmath1520@xmath16 mag @xcite . 
 all magnitudes for the kis survey are expressed in the vega system . 
 white dwarfs have bluer colours than main - sequence stars , and most single da white dwarfs also have strong h@xmath14 absorption lines , leading to @xmath17 ( see bottom panel of fig .  [ 
 fig : colours ] ) . 
 we have integrated the atmospheric models of canonical - mass 0.6@xmath9  ( @xmath18  @xmath19 ) white dwarfs of @xcite with the various filter profiles to guide our colour cuts , similar to @xcite . 
 our photometric selection recovered kic4552982 , the first zzceti star in the _ kepler _ field @xcite . 
 we narrowed our selection to a small region around kic4552982 and to candidates close to the empirical ( @xmath3 , @xmath20  @xmath6 ) instability strip projected into @xmath21 space . 
 this left more than 60 white dwarf candidates , 43 of which we were able to follow up spectroscopically ( table  [ phot - summary ] ) . 
 we were awarded a total of eight nights on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) in 2012 , 2013 , and 2014 , where we obtained intermediate resolution spectra of 43 of our candidates in order to confirm their identities as white dwarf stars and to characterize their atmospheric parameters , especially their effective temperatures and surface gravities . 
 we used the intermediate - dispersion spectrograph and imaging system ( isis ) , with the r600r and r600b gratings on the red and blue arms , respectively . 
 the slit widths were chosen close to the seeing of each night to maximize spectral resolution ( @xmath22 ) . 
 a full journal of observations is included in table  [ tab : specjour ] . 
 the blue arm was centred at 4351  and the red arm at 6562 . 
 the spectra covered a wavelength range from roughly @xmath23  in the blue ( see fig .  [ spec - fit ] ) , and roughly @xmath24  in the red 
 . however , since the higher - order balmer lines contain the most information about the atmospheric parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we only used the blue arm for our balmer profile fits ( section  [ sec : atmosparams ] ) . 
 .journal of spectroscopic observations . [ cols=""<,^,^,^,^ "" , ]      in addition to the confirmation of nine new zzceti stars , our ground - based photometry has put relatively strong limits on the lack of photometric variability in eight other white dwarfs with effective temperatures near the zzceti instability strip . 
 those limits are quoted as a 3@xmath25 threshold in table  [ astero - summary ] , and represented visually with a ft for each object in figure  [ fig : ftnewnov ] . 
 several of these non - variable white dwarfs have atmospheric parameters that place them within the empirical zzceti instability strip given their uncertainties , most recently updated by @xcite . 
 it has been assumed that all white dwarfs in this region can foster a partial ionization zone and thus pulsate  that the instability strip is pure  but this claim is still under review @xcite , although there is good agreement between the observed and theoretical zz ceti instability strip ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 we will not address that issue here , other than to say there are a number of reasons why these objects may appear not to pulsate . 
 firstly , it is possible the white dwarfs really do vary , but at lower amplitudes than our detection limits allow ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 additionally , it is possible that subtle issues in the flux calibration of our spectra have introduced unaccounted for systematic uncertainties in the derived atmospheric parameters , and the stars may have true temperatures outside the instability strip . given that the non - variable stars are more or less uniformly distributed in the ( @xmath3 , @xmath26 ) plane , it is likely that the low signal - to - noise of the time - averaged spectra is responsible for some interlopers , as demonstrated quantitatively by @xcite . 
 the most interesting white dwarf not observed to vary in our sample is the ultramassive j1926 + 3703 , which sits in the middle of the empirical instability strip . at @xmath27@xmath9 
 , it would be the second - most - massive white dwarf known to pulsate , behind only gd518 @xcite . 
 white dwarfs this massive likely have at least partially crystallized interiors . 
 we did not detect photometric variability in this relatively faint target ( @xmath28mag ) to a limit of roughly 6.9ppt , but it is quite possible that this white dwarf pulsates at lower amplitude . 
 for example , the two most massive known pulsating white dwarfs have low pulsations amplitudes , which rarely exceed 5ppt in a given night and are often far lower in amplitude @xcite . 
 the _ kepler _ mission would have given at least an order - of - magnitude improvement on these nov limits , were these targets observed from space . 
 for example , @xcite showed that j1909 + 4717 did not vary to at least an amplitude of 0.13ppt using just one month of _ kepler _ data in q4.1 . 
 however , only the four known pulsating white dwarfs listed at the end of section  [ sec : confirmationnewzzcetis ] were observed before the spacecraft had a failure of its second reaction wheel . 
 we note that many white dwarfs with atmospheric parameters within the empirical instability strip remain unobserved , and we encourage additional follow - up to constrain pulsational variability in these white dwarfs . we especially encourage further monitoring of the ultramassive j1926 + 3703 . 
 using photometric colour selection from the kis survey and subsequent medium - resolution spectroscopy from isis on the wht , we have discovered and characterized 42 new white dwarfs in the original _ kepler _ mission field . 
 follow - up , high - speed photometry from ground - based telescopes confirmed that at least nine of these objects are zzceti stars . 
 four were subsequently observed from space using the _ kepler _ space telescope , and @xcite report on the first zzceti found in this project , kic11911480 . 
 asteroseismic inferences from the extended datasets on the other three will be presented in a forthcoming publication . 
 unfortunately , the failure of the second and critical reaction wheel that kept _ kepler _ precisely pointed towards its original mission field occurred within months of our discovery of many of these new zzceti stars , and our sparse ground - based discovery light curves are so far the only time - series photometry for most of the targets here . at the end of its roughly four years 
 pointed towards its original field , _ kepler _ observed a total of six pulsating white dwarfs . 
 however , the two - reaction - wheel controlled _ k2 _ mission will cover a significantly larger footprint as it tours the ecliptic @xcite , and _ 
 k2 _ will likely observe more than a thousand white dwarfs , dozens of them pulsating . 
 already several important discoveries have come from these _ k2 _ observations of pulsating white dwarfs @xcite . 
 the colour selection methods honed in this work have ensured that dozens of pulsating white dwarfs have been or will be observed by _ 
 k2 _ for up to 80d at a time , using selection from a variety of multiwavelength photometric surveys .

[ firstpage ]    asteroseismology , surveys , stars : white dwarfs , oscillations",unfortunately the failure of the second and critical reaction wheel that kept _ kepler _ precisely pointed towards its original mission field occurred within months of our discovery of many of these new zzceti stars and our sparse ground based discovery light curves are so far the only time series photometry for most of the targets here. kis is a deep optical survey using the wide field camera on the 2 5 m isaac newton telescope int taken through four broadband filters and one narrowband filter h xmath14 covering more than 97percent of the original _ kepler _ field down to mag. this paper makes use of data collected at the isaac newton telescope and the william herschel telescope both operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos as well as data taken at the mcdonald observatory of the university of texas at austin. the colour selection methods honed in this work have ensured that dozens of pulsating white dwarfs have been or will be observed by _ k2 _ for up to 80d at a time using selection from a variety of multiwavelength photometric surveys. however the two reaction wheel controlled _ k2 _ mission will cover a significantly larger footprint as it tours the ecliptic and _ k2 _ will likely observe more than a thousand white dwarfs dozens of them pulsating. we were awarded a total of eight nights on the 4 2 m william herschel telescope wht in 2012 2013 and 2014 where we obtained intermediate resolution spectra of 43 of our candidates in order to confirm their identities as white dwarf stars and to characterize their atmospheric parameters especially their effective temperatures and surface gravities. using photometric colour selection from the kis survey and subsequent medium resolution spectroscopy from isis on the wht we have discovered and characterized 42 new white dwarfs in the original _ kepler _ mission field. in order to increase this sample we began the search for all white dwarfs in the original field of the _ kepler _ mission and more specifically any possible zzceti stars. it has been assumed that all white dwarfs in this region can foster a partial ionization zone and thus pulsate that the instability strip is pure but this claim is still under review although there is good agreement between the observed and theoretical zz ceti instability strip e g . spectroscopy has been a successful tool in obtaining da atmospheric parameters yet it only provides a view of the outermost layers of the white dwarf and it is subject to systematic problems that require correction if the star is cooler than roughly and the surface is convective,0.36610169491525424,0.13945578231292519,0.16271186440677962
48,"speculations concerning the existence and frequency of brown dwarfs can be traced to before the introduction of the term @xcite . since then , wide - field surveys have uncovered hundreds of candidates in the field and revealed two new spectral types , the l and t dwarfs @xcite . yet the frequency of brown dwarfs compared to stars has remained a topic of confusion and debate . in a pioneering work , 
 @xcite attempted the first census of the substellar initial mass function ( imf ) based on results from the two micron all sky survey @xcite . 
 they presented evidence for a low - mass imf that was more shallow than a salpeter @xcite slope , suggesting that brown dwarfs were not a significant contributor to dark matter . 
 @xcite used a bayesian approach to constrain the power - law slope below 0.08 @xmath2 to be in the range @xmath3 with a confidence level of 60% , where a salpeter slope is @xmath4 . 
 these results indicate that , although brown dwarfs do not contribute significantly to the mass of typical stellar populations , they might still be as abundant as stars @xcite . 
 the classical approach to deriving the mass function for stars and substellar objects is to take an observed luminosity function and apply a mass - luminosity relationship in order to derive the present - day mass function . 
 then , corrections , based on the theory of stellar evolution , permit one to estimate an _ initial _ mass function from the present - day mass function ( see e.g. @xcite for complete descriptions of this process ) . 
 the confounding variable in these analyses is the star formation history of the galactic disk , which is vital for substellar objects whose mass  luminosity relationship evolves with time .    a different approach is to use star clusters of known age as laboratories to measure the imf . 
 open clusters are in principle good candidates because of their richness . 
 yet they suffer from the effects of dynamical evolution , mass segregation , and evaporation ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 young ( @xmath5 10 myr ) embedded clusters are attractive alternatives as they are compact and rich ( from hundreds to thousands of stars within 0.31 pc ) , and yet to emerge as unbound ob / t associations , and the low mass objects are 101000 times more luminous than their older open cluster counterparts ( 0.116 gyr ) because they shrink and cool as they age . 
 indeed , embedded clusters have been the targets of aggressive photometric and spectroscopic surveys in an attempt to search for variations in the imf as a function of initial conditions . 
 @xcite found that the ratio of high - mass ( 110 @xmath6 ) to low - mass ( 0.11 @xmath6 ) stars for an ensemble of young clusters within 1 kpc was consistent with ( 1 ) each other and ( 2 ) having been drawn from the field star imf . 
 more recent studies have pushed well into the substellar mass regime ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . 
 there have been some claims for variations in the brown dwarf imf between nearby star - forming regions . 
 @xcite argued that the low - density taurus dark cloud had a dearth of brown dwarfs compared to the rich orion nebula cluster ( onc ) . 
 however , this preliminary result has been updated as additional data have become available and as the statistics improved for both clusters @xcite . 
 here we use observations of seven nearby star clusters to constrain the combined brown dwarf imf . in section 2 
 , we describe the data , illustrate that there is no strong evidence for variation in the substellar imf between the star - forming regions , and outline our approach to constrain the low - mass imf . in section 3 we present our results , and in section 4 we discuss our results in the context of previous work as well as theories of star ( and substellar object ) formation . 
 we have compiled the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs in nearby , well - studied young embedded clusters and the pleiades . 
 the regions included in this study are described briefly below , where the ratio of stars ( 0.081.0 @xmath2 ) to brown dwarfs ( 0.030.08 @xmath2 ) is calculated . 
 for all the regions , we consider the _ system _ imf , uncorrected for multiplicity within 200 au . 
 the sample is focused on embedded clusters , in which spectroscopy has been used to determine the age of the cluster , field star contamination has been taken into account , and an extinction - limited sample has been defined . furthermore , we have included the pleiades , because it is one of the best - studied open clusters and bacause its substellar imf has been estimated . 
 the break point at 0.08 @xmath2 has been adopted in accordance with the break point for the @xcite imf , similar to the characteristic mass in the @xcite single object imf . 
 only a few of the clusters adopted here have the imf derived in an extinction - limited sample reaching 0.02 @xmath2 and we have opted for 0.03 @xmath2 as a lower mass limit to obtain a larger sample of clusters . 
 _ @xcite imaged a 4 deg@xmath7 region of taurus that focused on the denser filaments , to identify cluster candidates . 
 candidates were confirmed as cluster members , by use of follow - up intermediate - resolutionoptical spectroscopy , on the basis of their effective temperature , luminosity , and spectral features . in total , 
 112 objects were confirmed members with derived masses between 0.03 and 1.0 @xmath2 and extinctions a@xmath8 mag . 
 some 96 objects were stars and 16 were brown dwarfs . 
 thus , the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs in taurus was found to be @xmath9 where the errors are estimated using the method of @xcite . 
 _ @xcite imaged a 42@xmath1028  region of the ic 348 cluster to identify cluster candidates . by the use of intermediate - resolution spectroscopy , 
 most of the candidates were confirmed as cluster members , on the basis of their effective temperature , luminosity , and spectral features , which indicated that the objects were young . in total , @xcite found 168 cluster members with masses between 0.03 and 1.0 @xmath2 and extinctions a@xmath8 mag . 
 the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs was found to be @xmath11 .    _ 
 _ @xcite imaged the central 1@xmath101  of the embedded cluster associated with mon r2 by utilizing the near - infrared camera andd multi - object spectrometer on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . 
 an extinction - limited sample a@xmath12 mag was defined and a total of 19 objects were detected with masses between 0.03 and 1 @xmath2 . 
 the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs was found to be @xmath13 . 
 _ chameleon 1 . 
 _ @xcite obtained an extinction - limited sample in chameleon 1 that was complete down to 0.01 @xmath2 for a@xmath14 mag , by use of observations of a 0.22@xmath100.28  region with the advanced camera for surveyes on board _ hst _ and a subsequent spectroscopic follow - up of cluster member candidates . 
 the sub - sample from 0.03 to @xmath15 @xmath2 includes 24 objects and the ratio @xmath16 was found to be @xmath17 . 
 _ pleiades . _ 
 the pleiades is one of the best - studied open clusters , and numerous derivations of the imf have been published . 
 here we focus on the survey by @xcite who covered a 6.4 deg@xmath7 region of the pleiades . 
 the survey had a saturation limit of 0.48 @xmath2 . 
 for higher masses , the survey was combined with a mass function built using the @xcite database . 
 the pleiades suffer relatively low ( @xmath18 mag ) , mostly uniform , extinction , with negligible impact on the completeness of this sample , so we did not apply a reddening criterion . 
 the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs was found to be @xmath19 .    _ the orion nebular cluster . _ 
 the onc has been the subject of extensive studies @xcite . 
 we take the adopted ratio of stars to substellar objects from the study of @xcite . the total sample , covering the central 5.1@xmath105.1 , contains approximately 200 objects with masses between 0.02 and 0.6 @xmath6 and a@xmath20 mag . using their figure 14 , and extrapolating the slope from 0.080.6 to 1.0 @xmath6 ( one additional bin in their plot ) , we arrive at a ratio of stars to substellar objects of @xmath21 . 
 _ ngc 2024 . _ 
 the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs in ngc 2024 was found by @xcite from their photometric and spectroscopic study , covering the central 10@xmath1010 . 
 they assigned masses to the photometric objects on the basis of the mass distribution in each magnitude bin , determined from the spectroscopic sample as in @xcite . 
 the result was that a total of 148 objects in their survey area has masses between 0.02 and 1 @xmath6 and extinctions a@xmath22 15 mag . based on their figure 9 
 , we find that there are 27 objects between 0.03 and 0.08 @xmath6 resulting in a ratio of stars to substellar objects of @xmath23 . 
 table  [ results ] shows the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs for nearby embedded clusters and the pleiades , as described above , and the distribution of ratios is shown in fig ,  [ figure1 ] . 
 the weighted mean of the ratios is found to be 4.3 , and the standard deviation of the weighted mean is 1.6 . 
 all of the measurements presented are consistent with the weighted mean within 2@xmath24 . 
 there is thus little evidence for variation in the low - mass imf between the different regions and we have adopted the hypothesis that the imf is universal . under this assumption , 
 the complete set of imf determinations can be combined to place constraints that are stronger than for each of the individual measurements . 
 for each cluster , we have calculated the probability of obtaining the observed ratio of stars to brown dwarfs for a given imf or greater . 
 the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs drawn from a given sample size with an assumed imf is determined by the binomial theorem . 
 the predicted distribution of ratios from both segmented power - laws and a ( * ? ? ? * @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) lognormal imf for a cluster of 100 objects with unresolved binaries is shown in the lower panel in fig . 
 [ figure1 ] . 
 the peak mass in the lognormal is slightly higher , and the width is slightly more narrow than is presented in @xcite . 
 the change in the best - fit parameters in @xcite is due to an updated luminosity function @xcite . 
 a similar increase in the peak mass has been suggested by @xcite . 
 the slope of the segmented power - law between 0.08 and 1.0 @xmath2 was chosen to be @xmath28 , and the slope has been varied below 0.08 @xmath2 in the range @xmath3 , which is the 60% confidence interval presented by @xcite . 
 it is clear that the rising and flat imfs ( @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , respectively ) are difficult to reconcile with the observed distribution of ratios . 
 we have quantitatively assessed the likelihood of obtaining the observed ratios from an assumed imf as follows . for each of the seven measurements , 
 the probability of obtaining that ratio or higher , assuming an underlying imf , is calculated by adopting the binomial theorem . 
 the product of the seven probabilities is then calculated . 
 we find these values , which we refer to as the binomial tail product , or btp , to be @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , for a chabrier , falling , flat , and rising imf , respectively . if each cluster sample was drawn from the assumed underlying imf , and if each cluster had an infinite number of objects , we would expect the combined product of this statistic for a sample of seven clusters to be @xmath35 . 
 the lognormal imf appears to reproduce the observed ratios best , followed by the falling power - law imf . 
 how consistent are the measured ratios with a chabrier imf and with what confidence can other imfs be ruled out ? 
 we have investigated that question by performing monte carlo simulations . 
 we created an artificial set of seven clusters , each containing 100 objects ( the median number of objects in our sample ) . 
 the 100 objects are then assigned masses according to the assumed underlying imf , and the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs for each cluster is determined . 
 for each of the ratios , the probability of observing that value or higher is calculated and the seven probabilities are multiplied , as was done for the observed set of clusters . 
 the btp for the observed clusters is then compared with the distribution of btps just derived . because each factor in the btp is drawn from a binomial distribution ( of varying shapes ) , each imf gives the same expected distribution of btps . 
 figure  [ figure2 ] shows the cumulative distribution of btps for a set of 10,000 simulations . 
 overplotted are the probabilities obtained above for the observed set of clusters assuming the four different underlying imfs . 
 we find that 37% of the simulations have a probability equal to or lower than what was found assuming a chabrier imf , and in only @xmath360.05%-0.1% of the simulations is the probability equal to or lower than found assuming a falling power - law imf . in none of the simulations 
 did the low probabilities for the flat or rising power - law imfs occur ( p @xmath5 0.01 % ) . 
 the results indicate that the imf is falling in the brown dwarf regime and that the chabrier imf is consistent with the observations . 
 the results on the imf presented here are based on the system imf , including binaries unresolved within 200 au . as such , they may be difficult to compare directly with the locally derived ( within 20 pc ) field imf discussed in @xcite that suffers from a much smaller fraction of unresolved binaries . yet the overall binary frequency for ultra - cool dwarfs ( m6 and later ) appears to be low ( @xmath3620% , * ? ? ? 
 * ) , and furthermore the _ relative _ number of companions with separations @xmath3715 au and mass ratios q @xmath37 0.4 may be extremely low around very cool stars @xmath36 1% ; @xcite .    indeed , 
 if the companion mass ratio distribution follows the chabrier imf at wide separations , then one could expect fewer very low mass companions as one surveys progressively lower mass primaries ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ) , consistent with the observations by @xcite . if the imf follows a chabrier imf in the brown dwarf regime below 0.03 @xmath2 ( say , down to the opacity limit for fragmentation of @xmath36 0.001 - 0.004 @xmath2 ; @xcite , then the number of stars below 1 @xmath2 will outnumber brown dwarfs 4.7 to 1 . 
 the sense of our results , that the mass function is falling in the bd regime , is consistent with various ideas put forward to explain the shape of the imf ( @xcite and references therein ) . 
 building on the ideas of @xcite , @xcite produced an imf that is only weakly dependent on the jeans mass through dynamical interactions in the cluster . 
 however , @xcite show that the turbulent fragmentation models by @xcite predict too few low - mass binary systems . 
 @xcite , on the other hand , suggest that the imf should peak at higher masses in regions with low turbulence ( e.g. taurus ) which would result in a higher ratio of stars to brown dwarfs . 
 the lack of a strong variations in the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs is a problem for the turbulence models in general ; for example , magnetic turbulence models predict strong variations in the low - mass imf as a function of mach number and density @xcite . 
 if the preliminary results indicated here are borne out through further observations , then models that depend only weakly on initial conditions would be required ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . 
 possible imf variations at least within 1 kpc are smaller than can be detected by comparing the currently observed clusters . 
 thus , there are two challenges in detecting imf variations : ( 1 ) one needs clusters with a well - sampled population to minimize the inherently stochastic nature of populating an imf , and ( 2 ) a larger set of clusters is needed to detect even small imf variations with initial conditions . 
 although it appears that the variations in the imf down to 30 @xmath38 are modest , we still expect that variations will be seen at the lowest masses where the opacity limit for fragmentation can be reached @xcite and the metallicity of the star forming region could be imprinted in the lower mass limit .

49,"the study of spin dependent transport in low - dimensional systems has been largely dominated in the last few decades due to the rapid advancement in nano - scale science and technology  @xcite . 
 controlling electron s spin degree of freedom is extremely important for the development of quantum information processing as well as quantum computation  @xcite . 
 the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction which couples the electron s spin to the charge degree of freedom provides a much deeper insight for generating spin current and also its manipulation  @xcite rather than the usual methodologies  @xcite . 
 earlier , people were mainly using  @xcite ferromagnetic leads or external magnetic field to get spin filtering action though these are not very suitable especially for low - dimensional systems , since in one case a large resistivity mismatch is observed while in the other case the main difficulty appears for confining a huge magnetic field into a narrow region , like a nano - ring .    depending on the sources , spin - orbit interaction 
 is classified in two different categories : one is called extrinsic type which appears mainly due to magnetic impurities , while the other is defined as intrinsic type that appears as a result of lacking of inversion symmetry . in this category generally 
 two kinds of spin - orbit interactions are taken into account . 
 they are called as rashba and dresselhaus so interactions  @xcite . 
 the first one is associated with the inversion asymmetry of the structure and its strength can be regulated by means of external gate potential , and the second one is related to the bulk inversion asymmetry whose coupling strength depends on the material . 
 considering the coupling of spin degree of freedom to the momentum of an electron , spin polarized currents in output terminals of a multi - terminal conductor can be achieved from a purely unpolarized electron beam injected to the input terminal  @xcite . 
 the existing literature suggest that a lot of theoretical progress has already been done to explore spin selective transmission through different model geometries . 
 for example , a planar t - shaped conductor  @xcite with a ring resonator exhibits polarized spin currents in outgoing leads in presence of rashba so interaction . in other work peeters _ et al . _ 
 have shown how a ring - like geometry can be utilized as an electron spin beam splitter exploring the possible quantum interference effect in presence of so coupling  @xcite . at the same time nikolic and his group  @xcite put forward several key ideas in this particular field .    in spite of the considerable volume of work available in this particular area , 
 a practically unexplored issue is how does the curvature of a material which is clamped within input and output leads influence spin polarization .    to the best of our knowledge , this part is unaddressed so far . in the present work 
 we essentially focus towards this direction . 
 we investigate the curvature effect on spin polarization by considering two simple geometries : a simple linear conductor and a ring - like geometry which is formed by bending the chain . 
 the results are quite interesting . using a tight - binding ( tb ) framework and based on green s function formalism 
 we show that for a ring shaped conductor spin polarized currents are obtained in output leads of a multi - terminal geometry from a completely unpolarized beam of electrons , while absolute zero spin polarization is obtained for the linear conductor . 
 the rest of the paper is organized as follows . 
 section ii illustrates two different models together with a brief theoretical description to obtain spin polarization in two output leads . 
 section iii contains numerical results and discussion , and finally , in section iv we summarize our essential results . 
 in this section we describe two different systems of our study and present a general theory for calculating spin polarization coefficient @xmath0 in two output leads based on green s function formalism . 
 the three - terminal bridge setup is schematically shown in fig .  [ model ] , where we take two different configurations of the same material . in one configuration 
 we choose a finite one - dimensional ( @xmath1d ) chain , which is then bent to form a @xmath1d ring to generate another configuration . in both these two cases the material , subjected to rashba spin - orbit interaction , 
 is connected with one input ( lead-1 ) and two output leads ( lead-2 and lead-3 ) . 
 a tight - binding framework is given under the nearest - neighbor hopping approximation to describe the bridging material ( ring / chain ) and the side - attached leads . 
 the tb hamiltonian of the entire system reads as , @xmath2 where three different terms in the right side correspond to the hamiltonians of three different regions of the bridge system those are elaborately explained below . 
 the first term , @xmath3 , describes the hamiltonian of the conductor placed between the incoming and outgoing leads . depending on its geometry ( ring - like or chain - like ) the hamiltonian looks different . for a @xmath4-site linear conductor subjected to rashba so interaction the tb hamiltonian  @xcite gets the form : @xmath5_z   \mbox{\boldmath $ c$}_{n+1 } + h.c .

 @xmath14 is the on - site energy and @xmath15 measures the isotropic nearest - neighbor hopping integral . 
 the parameter @xmath16 describes the rashba so coupling strength and the term @xmath17 gives the spin angular momentum of the electron . 
 the unit vector @xmath18 describes the direction of the movement of an electron between the sites @xmath13 and @xmath19 . 
 when this @xmath4-site linear conductor is bent to form a ring the hamiltonian becomes  @xcite , @xmath20 where , + @xmath21 with @xmath22 . 
 all the other symbols used in eq . 
 [ eq3 ] carry their usual meanings .    in our theoretical framework , 
 three metallic leads are considered to be identical , semi - infinite and free from any kind of impurities and spin - orbit interaction . 
 we can express them as , @xmath23 where @xmath24 for the three leads . in the absence of 
 any so coupling @xmath25 takes the form : @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 . 
 +   + where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the site energy and nearest - neighbor hopping integral , respectively , in the @xmath31-th lead . 
 other factors carry their usual meanings as stated earlier . 
 out of these three leads , lead-1 is treated as the input terminal , while the other two are considered as the output terminals and all of them are coupled to the conductor through the hopping integral @xmath32 . here 
 we assume that the lead-1 is always attached to site @xmath1 and the other two leads are coupled to the sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 , those are variables , of the conductor . 
 following the same footing as above , we can write the tb hamiltonian to describe the conductor - to - lead coupling as , @xmath35 here , @xmath36 \label{eq7}\ ] ] with @xmath37 + the site @xmath38 corresponds to the boundary site of the lead , and it is coupled to the @xmath13-th site of the conductor , which is variable .      the spin polarization coefficient in the output leads is defined as  @xcite , @xmath39 where , @xmath40 gives the transmission probability of an injecting electron with spin @xmath41 which gets transmitted through the drain with spin @xmath42 . 
 when @xmath43 we get pure spin transmission , while for the other case spin flip transmission is obtained . 
 equation  [ eq8 ] is the general expression of spin polarization coefficient between any two leads @xmath38 and @xmath44 , and , for our three - terminal system we call the polarization coefficients in two outgoing leads as @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in the present approach we select the quantization direction along the @xmath47 axis for simplification .    to calculate transmission coefficient 
 @xmath40 we use green s function formalism  @xcite . in this framework the two - terminal transmission probability between the leads @xmath38 and @xmath44 is defined as @xmath48 $ ] . here 
 @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the retarded and advanced green s functions , respectively , of the sample considering the effects of the electrodes . 
 @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the energy of an injecting electron , and @xmath53 s ( @xmath54 ) are the self - energies due to coupling of the conductor to the leads and @xmath55 s are their imaginary parts . in refs . 
 @xcite the detailed calculations of self - energy matrices are available . 
 based on the above theoretical framework we now analyze our numerical results . throughout the analysis we fix the electronic temperature of the system to absolute zero , and for simplification , we put @xmath56 . 
 other common parameters are as follows : @xmath57 and @xmath58 . 
 the rashba so coupling strength @xmath16 and all the energy scales are measured in unit of the hopping integral @xmath15 .    before focusing to the central point i.e. , the curvature effect on spin polarization in a multi - terminal ( more than one output lead ) system in presence of rashba so interaction , 
 we want to have a short glimpse on the system where a conductor subjected to so interaction is coupled to a single input and a single output lead i.e. , a two - terminal system . following our extensive numerical calculations 
 we can conclude that irrespective of the curvature of the bridging material , only so interaction can not induce spin polarization in output lead of a two - terminal system . 
 we verify it considering different geometrical shapes of the conductor , e.g. , circle , square , triangle , polygon , linear , etc . 
 in few recent works  @xcite it has also been shown that only so interaction    is incapable of producing spin polarization . 
 the reason is that , in presence of so coupling the time - reversal symmetry is still preserved , and therefore , it does nt break the kramer s degeneracy between the @xmath59 and @xmath60 states which results vanishing spin current in the output lead of a two - terminal system . 
 the degeneracy gets removed when the system is subjected to any kind of magnetic impurity or external magnetic field . under this situation a two - terminal system with so coupling exhibits polarized spin currents  @xcite . 
 this phenomenon has already been established in the literature , but the essential issue of our present analysis 
 the interplay between the curvature of the material and the multi - leads has not been addressed earlier .    to explore it , in fig . 
 [ ringpola ] we present the results for a three - terminal mesoscopic ring considering @xmath61 and @xmath62 . here 
 , the two outgoing leads are attached    symmetrically ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) with respect to the incoming lead , as shown schematically in fig . 
 [ model](a ) . 
 the upper panel of fig . 
 [ ringpola ] corresponds to the energy dependence of spin polarization coefficient for the one output lead , while for the other output terminal it is shown in the middle panel of fig . 
 [ ringpola ] , and , finally they are placed together in the lower panel of this figure to compare the polarization coefficients properly . from these spectra it is observed that finite spin polarizations , associated with the energy eigenvalues of the ring subjected to only so interaction , are obtained in both the two outgoing leads though the system is free from any kind of magnetic impurities . 
 most interestingly , we also see that the coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 are exactly identical in magnitude and opposite in sign for each value of the incident electron energy @xmath52 . 
 this phenomenon can be explained as follows . 
 the spin polarization    coefficient @xmath0 describes the normalized difference among the up and down spin charge currents propagating through the outgoing leads , since in our present scheme we assume the quantized direction along the z direction . in a multi - lead geometry 
 i.e. , when more than one outgoing lead is coupled to the system the kramer s degeneracy between the @xmath65 and @xmath66 gets removed and depending on the allowed paths of the moving electrons spin dependent scattering takes place . the spin dependent force associated with the 
 so coupling is responsible for this scattering . 
 now , in the ring - like geometry electrons can go through two different paths , and accordingly , the up and down spin electrons get deflected in two opposite directions by the spin dependent force during the movement of electrons through the ring geometry in presence of so interaction which results spin selective transmission through the outgoing leads . 
 this is the key aspect of observing mesoscopic spin hall effect  @xcite and the accumulation of opposite spin electrons on the opposite edges of a finite width conductor . 
 since the two outgoing leads are coupled symmetrically to the ring geometry with respect to the incoming lead , @xmath45 and @xmath46 get equal magnitude . 
 their sign reversals are also understood from eq . 
 [ eq8 ] .    by breaking the ring - lead interface geometry 
 one can achieve spin polarizations with unequal magnitudes . 
 the results are shown in fig . 
 [ ringpolanew ] when the output leads are attached asymmetrically with respect to the source lead . here 
 we fix @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and all the other parameters are kept identical as set in fig . 
 [ ringpola ] . 
 it is clearly seen that , unlike the symmetric configuration , the magnitudes of @xmath0 in two output leads are no longer equal for the asymmetrically connected ring - lead bridge setup . 
 this is exclusively due to the quantum interference effect among the electronic waves propagating through different arms of the ring geometry . 
 apart from getting unequal magnitudes of polarization coefficients in two output leads , all the other properties remain exactly invariant as described earlier in the case of symmetric configuration .    from these results 
 we can emphasize that , for the three - terminal ring geometry we get spin polarization due to so interaction only , since the sample is free from any kind of magnetic impurity or external magnetic field , but a two - terminal ring geometry can not provide polarize spin current under this situation . here , it is important to note that although the kramer s degeneracy between the @xmath65 and @xmath66 gets removed by coupling the conductor with a third lead or more , but it does nt ensure to get non - vanishing spin polarization in output leads which can be clearly understood from the following discussion .    the scenario becomes highly significant when the ring - like sample is transformed into the linear - like one . 
 the results are shown in fig . 
 [ chainpola ] considering two different chain - to - lead interface geometries . in one configuration ( fig . 
 [ chainpola](a ) ) the outgoing leads are coupled to the sites @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the linear conductor , while these coupling sites are @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the other configuration ( fig .  [ chainpola](b ) ) . the total number of atomic sites @xmath4 and the rashba so coupling are kept unchanged as taken in fig . 
 [ ringpola ] . from the spectra presented in fig . 
 [ chainpola ] , we interestingly see that both @xmath45 and @xmath46 drop exactly to zero for the entire energy band spectrum , and , these results are independent of the chain - to - lead interface geometry as well as the strength of the so coupling , which we confirm through our considerable numerical work . 
 this is really appealing in the sense that a same material subjected to so coupling exhibits finite spin polarization for one geometrical shape , while absolute zero spin polarization is obtained in the other geometrical configuration for a multi - terminal bridge setup . 
 this is solely due to the effect of curvature . for the linear chain 
 the up and down spin electrons can propagate only in a particular direction . 
 either it can be along x or y direction depending on the choice of the co - ordinate system . 
 under this situation , the spin dependent force which essentially scatter opposite spin electrons becomes zero , and therefore , no spin polarization is available even though the kramer s degeneracy is broken for such a multi - terminal bridge setup . 
 the disappearance of such spin dependent force in a linear sample can be justified from the following analysis . for a linear chain 
 the rashba dependent hamiltonian in the continuum model representation gets the form  @xcite : @xmath73 , assuming the movement of electrons along the x direction . 
 considering this hamiltonian if we calculate , being the position operator , then the output becomes exactly zero which immediately suggests vanishing spin dependent force since the force is directly proportional to . to get a finite spin    dependent force both the components @xmath74 and 
 @xmath75 are needed in the rashba term which is not possible in the case of a linear chain . 
 therefore , spin dependent scattering is no longer available , even in the presence of multi - leads . 
 now , an important point which should be noted here that when a linear conductor is properly bent to form a regular ring shaped geometry , the so coupling strength may be affected due to its curvature , but that does nt at all change the present physical scenario , and therefore , we consider the identical coupling strength for both these two geometrical configurations for the sake of simplification in our model calculations .    the results presented so far to explore the curvature effect on spin polarization in a three terminal geometry are computed for a conductor with only @xmath70 sites . keeping in mind a possible experimental realization 
 one may think how such a small sized conductor can be used to design a conductor - lead bridge setup . to establish this fact now we present the spin polarization coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 taking a @xmath76-site conductor for its two different shapes as considered earlier i.e. , ring - like and the linear - like one . 
 for the ring - like geometry , the results are presented in fig . 
 [ bigring ] , whereas for the other case they are shown in fig . 
 [ bigchain ] , and for both these two cases the results are computed for two distinct electrode - to - conductor configurations ( symmetric and asymmetric ) to justify the robustness of our investigation . from the spectra given in fig . 
 [ bigring ] it is observed that , like fig . 
 [ ringpola ] , here also the polarization coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 become exactly identical in magnitude and opposite in sign ( 1st column of fig . 
 [ bigring ] ) when the ring is attached symmetrically to    the outgoing leads . these coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 are no longer identical in magnitude for the asymmetric ring - lead configuration ( 2nd column of fig . 
 [ bigring ] ) , as expected . 
 this is exactly what we get in a @xmath70-site ring as shown in fig . 
 [ ringpolanew ] . 
 for the linear - shaped conductor with @xmath77 a vanishing spin polarization is obtained ( fig . 
 [ bigchain ] ) in its output leads for the entire energy band region irrespective of the chain - to - lead interface geometry and it is exactly similar in nature which we get earlier in the case of a @xmath70-site chain ( fig . 
 [ chainpola ] ) . from these results 
 we can emphasize that apart from getting more peaks and dips in @xmath0-@xmath52 spectrum for the ring - shaped conductor with increasing @xmath4 , all the basic physical properties i.e. , non - vanishing spin polarization coefficients with equal and/or unequal magnitudes associated with the ring - lead interface geometry and absolute zero spin polarization in the linear - like conductor irrespective of its coupling configuration to side - attached leads remain exactly unchanged . 
 for a very large sized ring several peaks and dips appear in @xmath0-@xmath52 spectrum from which it may seem that the spectrum is quasi - continuous , but looking it carefully one can always find distinct peaks since @xmath4 is finite . 
 thus , our essential goal of getting finite and vanishing spin polarizations in a multi - terminal geometry constructed with the same material with different curvatures is established . 
 the author is thankful to prof . 
 s. sil and m. dey for useful discussions . 
 to summarize , in the present communication we establish the curvature effect on rashba spin - orbit interaction induced spin polarization in a three - terminal bridge setup within a tight - binding framework based on green s function formalism . 
 the results are analyzed considering two different shaped geometries of the same material . in one configuration 
 we select the bridging material in a linear - like , which is then bent to form a ring - like geometry . quite interestingly , we find that finite polarization is obtained in two output leads for ring shaped geometry , while absolute zero spin polarization is noticed when the sample becomes linear . 
 this phenomenon also holds true even for any other higher - terminal bridge setup and independent of the lead - conductor interface geometries . 
 in addition to this ring - like geometry one might expect finite spin polarization in output leads for other geometrical configurations , except the linear one , which essentially leads to the robust effect of curvature on spin polarization in a multi - terminal bridge system . 
 all the results described in this communication are worked out at absolute zero temperature , though the finite temperature extension of this analysis is extremely trivial . 
 the thing is that at finite temperature no new phenomenon will appear and all the physical pictures presented here remain unaltered even at finite ( low ) temperature since the broadening of energy levels of the conductor due to its coupling with the side - attached leads is too large compared to the thermal broadening  @xcite .    in the present work , 
 we ignore the effect of on - site electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction . 
 we can incorporate this effect in our formalism in different ways . 
 one possible route is the mean field approximation  @xcite . 
 but , for this particular study e - e interaction does nt provide any such new insight since it can not scatter up and down spin electrons in opposite edges of the sample , as spin - orbit interaction does . 
 only some modifications in magnitudes of @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be expected . 
 before we end , it should be noted that to explore the effect of curvature on spin polarization in a three - terminal bridge setup we compute our numerical results considering some typical values of the parameters describing the systems . 
 but , all these physical properties i.e. , vanishing spin polarization in output leads of a linear - like conductor and finite spin polarization for a ring - like geometry remain absolute unchanged for any other set of parameter values . 
 these features certainly demand an experiment in this line .","the robust effect of curvature on spin polarization is reported in a three - terminal bridge system where the bridging material is subjected to rashba spin - orbit interaction .

50,"the increasing possibilities and sophisticated ways to control larger and larger quantum systems require a thorough understanding of the dynamics of open quantum systems  @xcite . as prime example 
 , the phenomenon of decoherence is an effect of the environmental impact on quantum behavior of the system , leading to a  sometimes rapid  decay of its coherences in a certain basis  @xcite .    with respect to quantum information processing 
 , decoherence is the main obstacle that needs to be overcome . 
 however , the influence of the environment on an open quantum system is not always of disturbing nature . 
 for example , an environment can also mediate quantum correlations between two qubits  @xcite , which implies that in the process system and environment must get quantum mechanically correlated . 
 it is an interesting question under which circumstances and how exactly those correlations develop . 
 many interesting results about correlations and entanglement in quantum many body systems have been obtained in the last few years  @xcite . 
 the issue of system - environment correlations is also of importance for the quantum foundations of thermodynamics  @xcite . 
 although there are methods to detect the formation of system - environment correlations at the level of reduced dynamics  @xcite , a detailed analysis of the role of _ quantum _ correlations in decoherence phenomena lies beyond such an approach . to gain deeper understanding one surely has to investigate the total ( sometimes thermal ) state of the composite quantum system , which in fact has been done for a couple of model systems  @xcite . 
 some of the authors find decoherence accompanied by system - reservoir entanglement , some of them report of certain conditions under which decoherence appears without . 
 still , we lack a complete picture of entanglement _ dynamics _ including finite temperature environments and arbitrary system initial states .    here 
 we present an approach to this problem , based on a partial p - representation of the total state , investigating a purely decohering qubit . 
 it enables us to make detailed , state and temperature dependent statements on the evolution of the correlations between system and environment , which we relate to the decoherence process . 
 describing pure decoherence ( phase damping ) , we will assume a standard model  @xcite @xmath0 , by coupling a qubit @xmath1 via @xmath2 non - dissipatively to a bath of harmonic oscillators @xmath3  @xcite . 
 here @xmath4 denotes the transition frequency of the qubit and the coefficients @xmath5 describe the coupling strength between the qubit and each environmental mode of frequency @xmath6 . 
 assuming the environment to be initially in the thermal state @xmath7/{\text{tr}}[\exp[-h_{\text{env}}/k_b t]]$ ] at temperature @xmath8 , and the total initial state to be the product @xmath9 , the following exact time local master equation for the reduced density operator @xmath10 $ ] follows @xmath11}-\frac{\gamma(t)}{2}\left(\rho_{\text{red}}-\sigma_z\,\rho_{\text{red}}\,\sigma_z\right ) .

 @xmath14 represents the _ initial _ state of the qubit , with bloch vector @xmath15 . for the following , 
 it is essential to consider _ arbitrary _ ( mixed ) initial qubit states . 
 this choice reflects experimental limitations in the preparation process , and also allows us to investigate decoherence and qubit - environment correlations in cases where the qubit is part of an entangled many qubit state  @xcite . 
 while pure initial qubit states will always lead to system - environment entanglement , even a slight decrease of initial purity may have a significant effect on the nature of the ensuing system - environment correlations .    in  ( [ equ : masterequation - decoherence ] ) and ( [ equ : solution - roh_red ] ) we have introduced 
 the time dependent decoherence rate @xmath16 which by means of the spectral density of the environment @xmath17 can be written as @xmath18\cos[\omega s ] . 
 \label{equ : decoherence_rate}\ ] ] for a time independent @xmath19 , qubit coherences decay on the decoherence time scale @xmath20 , sometimes referred to as `` @xmath21 '' . for the general case considered here , 
 we define the decoherence time @xmath22 through the relation @xmath23 . 
 the off - diagonal elements of the qubit have then decayed to a fraction @xmath24 of the initially present quantum coherences . 
 indeed , a constant decoherence rate @xmath19 is obtained for an ohmic spectral density with a cut - off frequency @xmath25 , in the limit of high temperatures @xmath26 and large times @xmath27 . 
 then eq . 
 ( [ equ : masterequation - decoherence ] ) is of lindblad type , and the corresponding dynamics is markovian . for our studies we choose a sharp cut - off , @xmath28  @xcite , where @xmath29 parametrises the coupling strength between system and environment . 
 accordingly , the asymptotic decoherence rate is given by @xmath30 . 
 decoherence of qubits is sometimes modelled by random unitary dynamics  @xcite . 
 it is known that on the level of the reduced state , single - qubit decoherence can always be modelled that way , while for two qubits or more , there is genuine `` quantum '' decoherence 
 i.e. there is decoherence that  even on the reduced level  can only be modelled by coupling the system to a quantum environment  @xcite . considering a single qubit and its given quantum environment , this raises the question to 
 what extent the total state involves any quantum correlations . 
 in fact , the most general class of total initial states which allows for completely positive reduced dynamics is classically correlated , with zero discord  @xcite . we emphasize that for our special choice of the spectral density , the map @xmath31 induced by  ( [ equ : masterequation - decoherence ] ) is completely positive for all @xmath32 . 
 this is due to the positivity of @xmath16 in our case , which also implies the `` markovianity '' of the reduced dynamics for all times in the sense of both works  @xcite . 
 for all these recent investigations it is relevant to gain a deeper understanding of the build - up of quantum correlations between system and environment . in this paper 
 we investigate the correlation dynamics of the total state for a mixed initial product state and identify entangled and classically correlated regimes . 
 it turns out that in general the dynamics of system - environment correlations can be markedly rich . 
 let us provide the framework necessary to extract the desired information from the total state . 
 we are interested in an exact expression for the total state @xmath33 , which we will represent in a coherent state basis . in a sense , 
 our approach here is a mixed - state generalization of the _ non - markovian quantum state diffusion _ approach to open quantum system dynamics  @xcite . 
 we will combine the environmental coherent state labels into the vector @xmath34 of complex numbers and consistently make use of the notation @xmath35 ( see also  @xcite ) . 
 furthermore , introducing the average thermal occupation number @xmath36 of the @xmath37-th environmental mode , it is possible to expand the total state in terms of coherent states @xmath38 @xmath39 defining the matrix - valued partial p - function @xmath40 with values in the @xmath41 dimensional state space of the qubit . 
 here we symbolically write @xmath42/{\overline{n}}:=\prod_\lambda\exp[-|\xi_\lambda|^2/{\overline{n}}_\lambda]/{\overline{n}}_\lambda$ ] . 
 we find that expression  ( [ equ : p - representation ] ) is a solution of the total von - neumann equation with initial @xmath43 if @xmath44 where @xmath45 $ ] and @xmath46\exp[b(t)-\left\{({b}(t)|\xi)-(\xi|b(t))\right\}]$ ] . here 
 we have introduced the complex time dependent vectors @xmath47 and @xmath48 with scalar product @xmath49 and vector components @xmath50 furthermore , we use the abbreviations @xmath51\\ b(t)&=&2\,{\text{re}}{\hspace{-0.5ex}}\int_0^tds\int_0^sd\tau\left[\sum_\lambda\frac{2{\overline{n}}_\lambda+1}{{\overline{n}}_\lambda}|g_\lambda|^2e^{-i\omega_\lambda(t - s)}\right].\end{aligned}\ ] ] initially , @xmath52 and note that there are no approximations necessary to achieve the result  ( [ equ : exact - solution ] ) and thus via  ( [ equ : p - representation ] ) to obtain the exact state of the composite system . 
 having the total state at hand we now want to draw conclusions on its separability . for this purpose 
 we argue as follows :    as long as the partial p - function is positive - semi - definite the total state @xmath33 in representation  ( [ equ : p - representation ] ) is trivially separable . 
 since one eigenvalue of @xmath53 is always positive , a good indicator for this circumstance is the determinant @xmath54 $ ] which in fact is independent of the coherent state labels @xmath55 and 
 @xmath56 : @xmath57=e^{-2a(t)}\left[1-z^2\right]-e^{2b(t)}(x^2+y^2 ) .

 , condition  ( [ equ : condition - sep ] ) defines an area in the @xmath65-plane , shown in fig . 
 [ fig : sep - ent - dec_hightemp ] , within which the total state is necessarily separable . 
 note that for a pure initial state the r.h.s . 
 of  ( [ equ : condition - sep ] ) is zero and the separable area vanishes .     the qubit may decohere without becoming entangled to its environment despite an initial purity of @xmath66.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    it turns out that as @xmath67 , @xmath63 grows above all bounds for all temperatures and it becomes independent of temperature in the high temperature limit , @xmath68 . as a consequence , for any initial state and temperature , expression  ( [ equ : p - representation ] ) of the total state at some point in time ceases to represent a proper mixture and thus , separability can no longer be concluded . 
 let us stress that positivity of @xmath69 is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for separability . 
 condition  ( [ equ : condition - sep ] ) is visualized in fig . 
 [ fig : sep - ent - dec_hightemp ] , where we relate our criterion for separability to the decoherence time @xmath22 introduced earlier . 
 we resort to the _ weak coupling _ regime ( @xmath70 ) and choose a qubit initial state in the equatorial plane ( @xmath71 ) of the bloch sphere with purity @xmath72 ( recall that @xmath73 denotes the length of the bloch vector , i.e. , @xmath74 ) . 
 while at low temperatures @xmath22 lies outside of our separability area , it is inside this area for temperatures of about @xmath75 . in the high temperature regime , when the dynamics is governed by a lindblad equation , decoherence of the qubit is thus complete , while the total state is still separable . 
 this is especially striking because the initial state is so close to being the pure state @xmath76 .    ) 
 virtually all initial states decohere before any entanglement to the bath is built up.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the question arises as to how many initial states , depending on temperature , meet the very same fate . in fig . 
 [ fig : volumeofstates ] we display the relative volume of the set of states that are still separable at @xmath22 , i.e. after decoherence . 
 remarkably , in the regime where the master equation  ( [ equ : masterequation - decoherence ] ) is of lindblad form ( @xmath77 ) for practically all states decoherence has long happened before any entanglement between system an environment can build up . 
 in fact , this is not too surprising : in the weak coupling limit ( `` born approximation '' ) a master equation of lindblad type is usually derived assuming that the joint state of system plus environment to the lowest order in the interaction remains a product state  @xcite : one substitutes @xmath78 in the perturbative evolution equation . 
 the severity of this approximation is apparently manifested in the fact that entanglement builds up very slowly compared to the time scale given by decoherence . 
 all pure qubit initial states different from @xmath79 and @xmath80 will lead to system - environment entanglement immediately . 
 however , as we have shown in the previous section even a slight reduction of purity ( e.g. @xmath72 ) may lead to a prolonged period of separability , long enough for the qubit to loose its coherence . 
 being separable at least up to the time when @xmath54 $ ] becomes negative , @xmath81 turns into an entangled state at the latest when its partial transpose @xmath82 yields a negative expectation value @xmath83 in some state @xmath84 of the composite system  @xcite . 
 hence , to detect entanglement we aim to find a state @xmath85 in the hilbert space of the qubit such that @xmath86 denoting the pure state on the bloch sphere which has the smallest overlap with the transpose of the initial state of the qubit as @xmath87 , it turns out that @xmath88 fulfills this task . 
 this choice of state is further elaborated upon in section  [ sec : sme ] . by solving the integral  ( [ equ : 
 expect ] ) one finds the following expression for the expectation value : @xmath89\right.\\ & \qquad-\left.e^{b(t)-\frac{\overline{s}(t)}{2}}\frac{(x^2+y^2)}{r}\right ) , \end{split } \label{equ : negative - expect}\ ] ] where @xmath90 arises from @xmath91 by inverting the coefficients @xmath92 . 
 this quantity becomes negative , i.e. the total state is entangled , if the following condition is fulfilled : @xmath93 . 
 \label{equ : condition - ent}\ ] ] note that @xmath94 and hence the quantity on the r.h.s .  ( [ equ : condition - ent ] ) is always non - negative .    as before with inequality  ( [ equ : condition - sep ] ) for separability , for any initial state , this new inequality  ( [ equ : condition - ent ] ) defines an area in the temperature - time plane in which entanglement of the total state is assured . 
 as before , this is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for entanglement .    in terms of the spectral density the relevant function reads @xmath95\cos[\omega(s-\tau ) ] . 
 \end{split } \label{equ : e_t_continuum}\ ] ] in the limit of high temperatures and large times , @xmath96 becomes independent of time , @xmath97 . as a consequence , for every initial state 
 there is a temperature above which our criterion is no longer able to detect entanglement . as we will show in figures  [ fig : sep - ent - dec ] ( a ) and ( b ) for low temperatures and relatively short times the criteria for separability and entanglement cover almost the entire @xmath65-plane and only little `` unknown territory '' ( the white areas ) remains .      in fig .

 ( b ) for mixed initial conditions decoherence can occur in both domains , here shown for an initial state with purity @xmath98.,title=""fig:"",scaledwidth=47.0% ]    we relate the decoherence time @xmath99 to our criteria for separability and entanglement . to ensure that entanglement builds up fast , we here resort to the _ strong coupling _ regime ( @xmath100 ) . 
 it becomes apparent that for an initial qubit state that is pretty pure ( @xmath101 ) , in the considered low temperature range , decoherence is complete only after entanglement has built up ( a ) . 
 by contrast , for an initial qubit mixed state with purity @xmath98 ( depending on temperature ) decoherence can occur _ before _ or _ 
 after _ the two subsystems were able to entangle ( b ) . 
 these results show that in general there is no direct connection between decoherence and the formation of system - reservoir entanglement : surely , if the qubit is prepared in a pure state , decoherence is always accompanied by entanglement of the total state , independently of temperature . if the initial state is already a completely incoherent mixture , the two subsystems will never get entangled . in all other cases there are two disjoint domains of temperature implying decoherence _ before _ and _ after _ the qubit was able to entangle with its environment , respectively .    we now want to further elucidate the nature of decoherence depending on the initial state of the qubit . in the cut through the bloch sphere of fig .  [

 [ fig : scan_blochsphere_ent ] all states _ outside _ the area determined by a curve of given temperature decohere after entanglement has built up . 
 as the coupling to the environment distinguishes the south and north pole of the bloch sphere as robust states , for a given purity @xmath73 , there is no global value of temperature @xmath8 defining the cut between `` separable '' and `` entangling '' decoherence . 
 rather , states close to the poles tend to decohere while the total state is still separable . 
 states near the equator , by contrast , tend to decohere involving entanglement .    .

 in particular , we are able to detect conditions where the total state alternates between being entangled and separable . in fig . 
 [ fig : oscillations ] we show the correlation dynamics for an initial qubit state with purity @xmath103 . 
 it becomes apparent that for temperatures around @xmath105 the nature of the correlations changes oscillatorily between classical and quantum as a function of time . 
 although the special form of these oscillations depends on the form of the spectral density @xmath62 , we found numerically that similar behavior exists for different choices of @xmath106 . 
 at which the total state changes from ppt to npt , and vice versa ( points ) . the result obtained by our criterion  ( [ equ : condition - ent ] ) is displayed by the shaded areas . 
 obviously , there is perfect agreement . 
 qubit initial state with purity @xmath107 , @xmath108-coordinate @xmath109 and azimuth angle @xmath110.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    fig . 
 [ fig : oscillations ] demonstrates that  at low temperatures at least 
 our separability  ( [ equ : condition - sep ] ) and entanglement  ( [ equ : condition - ent ] ) criteria are quite good : the `` unknown territory '' of correlations is very small . to also estimate its accuracy for higher temperatures we study entanglement dynamics of the total state in the case of a single mode `` environment '' , where the full dynamics can be accessed numerically . 
 we are interested in the exact instant @xmath111 at which the definiteness of the partial transpose @xmath82 ceases to be positive ( ppt ) and negative eigenvalues emerge ( npt ) . on the other hand eq . 
 ( [ equ : condition - ent ] ) allows one to analytically derive the instant @xmath112 from which on we are able to detect entanglement with our test state determined from eq . 
 ( [ equ : test - state ] ) .    in fig . 
 [ fig : numerics ] we compare the temperature dependence of these characteristic times for an initial state with purity @xmath107 . 
 it turns out that there is an excellent agreement between the exact numerical and the analytical result , even at high temperatures . 
 we are confident that also in the case of larger environments , our entanglement criterion  ( [ equ : condition - ent ] ) is able to very efficiently detect a negative partial transpose . 
 clearly , it is an interesting and open question , whether the white areas in our @xmath65-diagrams correspond to entangled , bound entangled or separable total states . 
 we have investigated the dynamics and nature of system - environment correlations of a decohering qubit with arbitrary ( mixed ) initial state coupled to a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators . 
 when the reduced dynamics can be described by a markov master equation of lindblad type , we found that for almost all qubit initial states inside the bloch sphere decoherence is complete long before the build - up of any system - reservoir entanglement : the total state is still separable . 
 by contrast , in the strong coupling regime the correlation dynamics was found to be more complex : dependent on initial state and temperature of the surrounding heat bath , decoherence can occur before or after the qubit is able to entangle with its environment . at very low temperatures we were even able to detect conditions where the total state alternates between separable and entangled domains as a function of time . 
 finally , we have compared our criterion for system - reservoir entanglement with exact numerical results for the occurrence of a negative partial transpose in the case of a single mode environment and found excellent agreement . 
 we therefore believe to have found a reliable criterion for system - bath entanglement . clearly , it is desirable to further investigate the nature of system - environment correlations in the white regions in order to cover the whole range of temperatures and times . 
 moreover , we are confident that our approach may be applied to more general open quantum system dynamics .

51,"the lab for adaptive optics ( lao ) currently has a testbed dedicated to the development of two key ao technologies for large telescopes ( called multi - conjugate ao ( mcao)@xcite and multi - object ao ( moao ) ) . both of these technologies take advantage of tomographic reconstructions using multiple guidestars ( a.k.a . 
 reference sources)@xcite . 
 in particular , mcao attempts to achieve a high strehl over a large field of view ( fov ) by accounting for anisoplanatism , using multiple deformable mirrors at optical conjugates . 
 moao attempts to achieve very high strehls over small fovs embedded in larger uncorrected fields . 
 first results from the testbed were shown in ammons 2006@xcite . 
 recent results have demonstrated the effectiveness of tomography at finding the layers ofturbulence , and high strehls have been achieved with both mcao and moao . 
 the testbed uses three optically addressed spatial light modulators ( slms ) from hamamatsu photonics . 
 the slms allow us to have nearly 600,000 control elements , far more than any current mems . 
 slms have been used with some success in the biological sciences ( for example , a demonstration is described in awwal 2003)@xcite . 
 because their stroke is limited to approximately 1 wavelength deviation ( about 650 @xmath0 on the testbed ) and we would like to avoid phase - wrapping , we are incorporating a high stroke mirror into the testbed both to eliminate the need for the slms to phase wrap , and to test possible ao configurations for future systems called `` woofer - tweeter '' setups . 
 taking an analogy from audio technology , the woofer - tweeter configuration in ao refers to the pairing of a higher resolution dm that has small stroke together with a high stroke ( and consequently low resolution ) dm called a woofer . 
 though our testbed currently uses slms , woofer - tweeter combinations will also be useful for mems dms . 
 in addition to our lab , similar architectures are being studied at u. victoria @xcite and at nui galway .    [ 
 cols=""^ "" , ]     the particular alpao dm52 mirror we have in the lab has about a 133 @xmath0 @xmath1 focus shape when initially powered on but with no commands sent . in order to generate a flat shape we measured and inverted this wavefront and ran it through wooferfit to generate flattening commands . 
 our first attempt at flattening the dm52 in open - loop resulted in a residual of approximately 11 @xmath0 @xmath1 of surface flatness deviation over the full clear aperture of the mirror . 
 we then tried to fit a typical kolmogorov wavefront . 
 the testbed uses etched glass kolmogorov phase plates as turbulence generators . 
 the phase plates are meant to simulate a normal atmosphere s worth of wavefront aberration . 
 we measured the wavefront using a set of shack - hartmann wavefront sensors . after doing a tomographic reconstruction of the estimated volume 
 , there is a residual on the ground layer with approximately 250 @xmath0 @xmath1 tip / tilt removed wavefront error . 
 we then fit this kolmogorov wavefront with the alpao dm52 using wooferfit . 
 we compared the surface of the mirror as measured by a zygo interferometer to the wavefront generated by the tomography software . 
 our comparison shows a 25 @xmath0 @xmath1 disagreement between the alpao dm52 and the wooferfit predicted shape over the clear aperture ( see fig . 
 [ fig : fig3 ] above ) . 
 the fit was noticeably better within the central portion of the mirror and when apertured down to 90% of the clear aperture the agreement was roughly 20 @xmath0 @xmath1 . 
 it is important to note that these results are significant because they represent open - loop `` go - to '' control of the surface without the benefit of feedback from residual wavefront measurements . 
 hence these results are applicable to systems which need to run open - loop like moao configurations mentioned earlier . 
 we have tested the suitability of the alpao dm52 as a woofer dm and have shown it has promising open - loop characteristics . 
 initial results look good for woofer - tweeter implementation in our mcao testbed .

52,"gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) are cosmological explosions which produce an enormous amount of energy @xmath2erg within a few seconds to a few minutes by means of a highly relativistic jet . 
 a grb light curve generally consists of a single or multiple broad pulses and rapid variability within the pulses on a timescale down to a few milliseconds.@xcite on the other hand , the spectrum is a continuum which is generally attributed to an optically thin synchrotron emission.@xcite interestingly , the spectrum generally shows a hard to soft evolution within the individual pulses.@xcite hence , pulses are important and should be considered independently . 
 @xmath3 correlation : pulse - wise ( blue filled circles fitted with black solid line ) , burst average correlation of the same grbs ( orange open circles fitted with violet dot - dashed line ) and the same from nava catalog @xcite ( red dashed line with shaded @xmath4 data scatter ) . 
 ( b ) the @xmath5 contours of the fit parameters of the pulse - wise correlation for two redshift bins . 
 @xcite ]    in recent works , @xcite we have given particular attention to the individual grb pulses and obtained the timing and spectral informations . 
 we have then used the grb pulses to study grb correlations@xcite similar to the amati correlation@xcite . such studies are important due to several reasons : ( 1 ) as the correlation hold within the pulses it shows that the correlation is a pulse property , ( 2 ) it also shows that the correlation is real and not due to selection bias , ( 3 ) it provides a larger sample compared to the burst average studies . though pulse - wise grb correlation is powerful and indicates a basic mechanism of pulse generation , our pulse description is still empirical . here 
 we review the results of our correlation studies and the possible improvements based on our new findings on the grb spectrum . 
 we have developed a pulse model which describes a pulse simultaneously in energy and time domain.@xcite for this we use the spectral model as band function@xcite , lightcurve as norris model@xcite and spectral evolution as liang - kargatis model@xcite ( hereafter lk96 ) . our model 
 is implemented in the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec as a table model with two parameters  the peak energy at the beginning of a pulse ( @xmath6 ) and the characteristic evolution parameter ( @xmath7 ) . 
 we apply this model on grb 090618 and generate the individual pulses . 
 we derive various pulse properties e.g. , lightcurve and pulse width in various energies , spectral lag . 
 a comparison with the data shows an excellent agreement . 
 we then use this model for a set of _ fermi _ grbs with known redshift ( @xmath8 ) . 
 we find that the @xmath6 bears a strong correlation with the energy ( @xmath9 ) within the individual pulses with a pearson coefficient , @xmath10 and a chance probability , @xmath11 .    in a recent work,@xcite 
 we have studied pulse - wise amati correlation for a set of 19 grbs with 43 pulses . 
 we again obtain a good correlation ( see fig . 
 [ grb_correlation]a ) . 
 one of the major goal of grb correlation study is their application to constrain the cosmological parameters like matter and dark energy density at high redshifts , @xmath12 compared to that provided by the type ia supernovae ( @xmath13 in optical wavelengths ) . 
 however , we need to investigate whether the grb correlation holds for different redshifts . in fig .  [ grb_correlation]b 
 , we plot the contours ( @xmath14 for single parameter and @xmath15 for two parameters ) of the correlation parameters for different @xmath8 bins , and we clearly see that they match within @xmath14 . hence , our correlation is stable with @xmath8 . 
 the pulse model we have developed is an empirical one . 
 it is worthwhile to mention that all grb correlations are empirical and shows considerable data scatter . 
 this is also found in our pulse - wise correlation study ( fig . 
 [ grb_correlation]a ) . 
 hence , it is important to understand the physical mechanism of pulse emission and spectral characteristics . in some studies , 
 the synchrotron origin of the spectrum has been challenged by observations of a spectral photon index higher than -1.5 ( or even higher than -2/3 ) , which is disallowed in the fast cooling ( slow cooling ) regime.@xcite    in recent works it is found that the grb spectrum also contains a thermal component.@xcite in general the spectrum is a combination of the thermal and non thermal emission . however , the correct shape of the components is debatable , e.g. , a blackbody+powerlaw ( bbpl)@xcite , multi - colour blackbody+powerlaw ( mbbpl)@xcite , two blackbodies+powerlaw ( 2bbpl)@xcite , 2bb+cutoff powerlaw ( 2bbcpl)@xcite etc . moreover , the thermal emission is not always statistically significant . 
 one way to find the correct model is to analyze the data with good spectral resolution e.g. , _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , _ nustar _ , _ 
 chandra_. however , due to the focusing nature of these instruments such observations are rare . 
 recently , we have found two such cases , grb 090618@xcite and grb 130925a.@xcite in fig . 
 [ 2bbpl]a , we have shown the 2bbpl model fitted to the time resolved data of grb 090618 obtained from _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) and the xrt . in fig . 
 [ 2bbpl]b the temperature and hardness evolution of this grb is compared with that found for grb 130925a observed with the xrt , the _ nustar _ and the _ chandra_. we see a remarkable similarity of the spectral evolution which denotes a common radiation mechanism . 
 we note here that the pulse emission in grbs can have a wide variety . 
 we have studied all such varieties and found a clear evidence of the two blackbodies in all cases , namely , ( 1 ) grbs with single pulse@xcite , ( 2 ) grbs with separable multiple pulses@xcite and ( 3 ) those having highly variable lightcurve@xcite . hence 
 , the model appears to be a generic spectral shape . 
 we suggest a spine - sheath jet structure to explain our observations ( see fig . 
 [ jet]).@xcite such a structure is theoretically expected as the grb jet pierces through the envelop of the progenitor star . 
 the two blackbodies are produced at the two photospheres of the jet , while the photons crossing the boundary layer of the spine and sheath are inverse - compotonized and form a cutoff powerlaw . 
 in addition , internal shocks produced at larger radius will also contribute to the non - thermal emission . 
 we are planning to pin down the mechanism by developing a spine - sheath jet model@xcite and then applying this model on a large set of grbs to obtain the physical parameters of the jet . 
 the 2bbpl model is primarily found to be consistent with the data in kev  mev or lower ( e.g. , the xrt ) energies . 
 it is useful to apply this model to the prompt emission data in these energies and then investigate the predicted flux in other energies . in the following we perform such analysis to see how much we can explain the emission at very high energies ( gev ) based on the spectral model fitted to the lower energy data . 
 the very high energy ( gev ) emission is detected in some grbs with _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) . 
 this emission is delayed compared to the prompt kev 
 mev emission by a few seconds . 
 it is well known that the band function can not capture the wide spectrum from kev to gev . 
 also , the gev flux is found to be uncorrelated with the prompt kev  mev flux . 
 it is interesting to fit the kev  mev data with the 2bbpl model and then compare with the flux at gev energies . analyzing a set grbs detected by the lat , we find a significant correlation of the gev photon fluence with that of the non - thermal ( powerlaw ) component of the 2bbpl model fitted to the kev 
 mev data.@xcite also , the powerlaw flux of grbs with high gev emission tend to have a delayed onset , and this component lingers at the final phase of the prompt emission ( see fig . 
 [ delayed_pl ] ) . remembering that the gev emission is delayed and long lasting than the kev 
 mev emission , we strongly suggest that the powerlaw component of the 2bbpl model shares a common origin with the gev emission . in the framework of the spine - sheath jet model 
 , this emission is produced at higher radius probably by synchrotron emission . 
 on the other hand , the gev photons of grbs with low gev emission are probably produced due to inverse - compton of photons crossing the spine - sheath boundary . 
 clearly such finding strongly validates the 2bbpl model .    in future 
 we shall test whether one or more spectral components of the 2bbpl model can be used to study the grb correlation . 
 for example , in our pulse model we have assumed that the spectral evolution is given by the lk96 law . 
 we have found that fitting the spectrum with an additional blackbody component leads to a similar evolution . 
 now , the blackbody temperature shows a similar behaviour as shown by the @xmath16 ( see fig . 
 [ lk96 ] ) . 
 such findings give us hope to further improve the pulse description and finally obtain the fundamental grb correlation based on the physical spectral model .

53,"neutrons stars are born in gravitational collapse of massive , degenerate stellar cores . 
 newly born neutron stars are hot and lepton rich objects , quite different from ordinary low temperature , lepton poor neutron stars . in view of these differences , 
 newly born neutron stars are called _ protoneutron _ stars ; they transform into standard neutron stars on a timescale of the order of ten seconds , needed for the loss of a significant lepton number excess via emission of neutrinos trapped in the dense , hot interior .    in view of the fact that the typical evolution timescale of a protoneutron star ( seconds ) is some three orders of magnitude longer , than the dynamical timescale for this objects ( milliseconds ) 
 , one can study its evolution in the quasistatic approximation ( burrows & lattimer 1986 ) . properties of static ( non - rotating ) protoneutron stars , under various assumptions concerning composition and equation of state ( eos ) of hot , dense stellar interior were studied by numerous authors ( burrows & lattimer 1986 , takatsuka 1995 , bombaci et al . 
 1995 , bombaci 1996 , bombaci et al . 
 1996 ) . 
 the scenario of transformation of a protoneutron star into a neutron star could be strongly influenced by a phase transition in the central region of the star . 
 brown and bethe ( 1994 ) suggested a phase transition implied by the @xmath0 condensation at supranuclear densities . 
 such a @xmath0 condensation could dramatically soften the equation of state of dense matter , leading to a low maximum allowable mass of neutron stars . 
 in such a case , the massive protoneutron stars could be stabilized by the effects of high temperature and of the presence of trapped neutrinos , and this would lead to maximum baryon mass of protoneutron star larger by some @xmath1 than that of cold neutron stars . 
 the deleptonization and cooling of protoneutron stars of baryon mass exceeding the maximum allowable baryon mass for neutron stars , would then inevitably lead to their collapse into black holes . 
 the dynamics of such a process was recently studied by baumgarte et al . 
 it should be mentioned , however , that the very possibility of existence of the kaon condensate ( or other exotic phases of matter , such as the pion condensate , or the quark matter ) at neutron star densities is far from being established . 
 recently , for instance , pandharipande et al . ( 1995 ) pointed out that kaon - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon correlations in dense matter raise significantly the threshold density for kaon condensation , possibly to the densities higher than those characteristic of stable neutron stars . in view of these uncertainties 
 , we will restrict in the present paper to a standard model of dense matter , composed of nucleons and leptons . 
 the calculations of the static models of protoneutron stars should be considered as a first step in the studies of these objects . 
 it is clear , in view of the dynamical scenario of their formation , that protoneutron stars are far from being static . 
 due to the nonzero initial angular momentum of the collapsing core , protoneutron stars are expected to rotate . on the other hand , 
 the formation scenario involves compression ( with overshoot of central density ) and a hydrodynamical bounce , so that a newborn protoneutron star begins its life in a highly excited state , pulsating around its quasistatic equilibrium . in the present paper 
 we study the rotation of protoneutron stars ; pulsations of protoneutron stars will be discussed in a separate paper ( gondek , haensel & zdunik , in preparation ) . 
 some aspects of rapid uniform rotation of protoneutron stars have been recently studied in ( takatsuka 1995 , hashimoto et al . 
 however , the calculations reported by takatsuka ( 1995 ) were actually done for static ( non - rotating ) protoneutron stars , and were then used to estimate the maximum rotation frequency of uniformly rotating protoneutron stars , @xmath2 , via an `` empirical formula '' . 
 it should be stressed , that the validity of such an `` empirical formula '' , which expresses @xmath3 in terms of the mass and radius of the extremal _ 
 static _ configuration with maximum allowable mass , had been checked only in the restricted case of _ cold _ neutron stars ( haensel & zdunik 1989 , friedman et al . 
 1989 , shapiro et al . 
 1989 , haensel et al . 
 1995 , nozawa et al . 
 . only isentropic equations of state were considered by takatsuka ( 1995 ) . 
 hashimoto et al . ( 
 1995 ) calculated the structure of stationary configurations of uniformly rotating protoneutron stars , using a two - dimensional general relativistic code . 
 these authors restricted themselves to the case with zero trapped lepton number . 
 they assumed a constant temperature in the hot interior of the star , and used a zero temperature ( cold ) eos for @xmath4 . 
 it should be stressed , that the assumption of @xmath5 corresponds to an isothermal state in the newtonian ( flat space - time ) theory of gravitation . in general relativity 
 , we will define isothermal state by @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the lapse function and @xmath8 is the lorentz factor , see section 3.1 ) , and the effects of the space - time curvature will turn out to be rather important for massive neutron stars . also , their choice for the low density edge of the hot interior can be questioned . 
 finally , their criterion for finding maximally rotating configuration is actually valid only for cold ( @xmath9 ) or isentropic protoneutron stars : its use in the case of the @xmath5 hot interior is unjustified ( see section 3.2 for a correct statement of the stability criterion ) . in a recent paper , lai and shapiro ( 1995 ) have studied the secular evolution , secular `` bar instability '' , and the gravitational wave emission from the newly formed , rapidly rotating neutron stars . 
 however , these authors used unrealistic ( polytropic ) equations of state of neutron star matter . 
 moreover , the calculations were done within newtonian theory of gravitation . in view of this , the internal structure of their models of newly born neutron stars was quite different from that characteristic of the realistic models of protoneutron stars . 
 the problem of the secular `` bar instability '' in rapidly rotating neutron stars was also studied , using general relativity , by bonazzola et al ( 1995 ) . however , numerical calculations were done only for realistic equations of state of _ cold _ neutron star matter .    in the present paper 
 we study the properties of uniformly rotating protoneutron stars , using exact relativistic description of the rapid , stationary rotation , combined with realistic equations of state of hot dense matter , used in the whole range of temperatures and densities relevant for protoneutron stars . 
 in particular , we calculate the maximum frequency of uniform rotation of protoneutron stars and its dependence on their baryon mass , and on the thermal state and composition of stellar interior . 
 it is clear , that uniform rotation represents only an approximation to the actual rotational state of a newly born protoneutron star . 
 existing numerical simulations of gravitational collapse of rotating cores of massive stars produce differentially rotating protoneutron stars ( janka & moenchmeyer 1989a , b , moenchmeyer & mueller 1989 ) . 
 however , it should be stressed that the initial rotational state of collapsing core is unknown , and this implies uncertainty concerning the rotational state of resulting protoneutron star . 
 it is reasonable to say , that the actual degree of nonuniformity of rotation of a protoneutron star should be considered as unknown . in the present paper 
 we will not address the question of the physical mechanisms that could `` rigidify '' the rotational motion within the protoneutron star interior . 
 however , we will use the approximation of uniform rotation in order to limit the number the parameter space for our numerical calculation , and also because of the relative simplicity of the stability analysis in this specific , idealized case .    within our simplified model , 
 the `` neutrinosphere '' ( which has actually a deformed , spheroidal shape ) will separate hot , neutrino - opaque interior of a protoneutron star ( hereafter referred to as `` hot interior '' ) from a significantly cooler , neutrino - transparent envelope . 
 the actual thermal state of the hot interior of protoneutron star is determined by its formation scenario , and is expected to be influenced by the dissipative processes ( damping of pulsations , viscous damping of differential rotation , neutrino diffusion ) . for simplicity , we will restrict ourselves to two limiting cases : an isothermal ( @xmath6 , see section 3 ) , and an isentropic ( entropy per baryon @xmath10 ) hot interior . 
 we will also consider two limiting cases of the lepton composition of the protoneutron star interior . 
 the first case , referring to the very initial state of protoneutron star , will correspond to a fixed trapped lepton number . in the second case 
 , neutrinos will not contribute to the lepton number of the matter , which will correspond to vanishing chemical potential of the electron neutrinos ; such a situation will take place after a deleptonization of a protononeutron star . 
 the position of the neutrinosphere will be located using a simple prescription based on specific properties of the neutrino opacity of hot dense matter . in all cases , the equation of state of hot dense matter 
 will be determined using one of the models of lattimer and swesty ( 1991 ) . 
 the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 
 we describe the physical state of the interior of protoneutron star , with particular emphasis on the eos of the hot interior at various stages of evolution . 
 we explain also our prescription for locating the `` neutrinosphere '' of a protoneutron star , and we give some details concerning the assumed temperature profile within a protoneutron star . using simple estimates of the timescales relevant for various transport processes , we justify the approximation of stationarity which is used throughout this paper . in section 3 
 we give a brief description of the exact equations , used for the calculation of stationary configuration of uniformly rotating protoneutron stars . 
 we discuss also stability of rotating configurations with respect to the axially - symmetric perturbations . 
 the numerical method , used for the calculation of rapidly rotating configurations of protoneutron star , is briefly described in section 4 , where we also discuss numerical precision of our solutions . 
 maximum rotation frequency , for various physical conditions prevailing in the hot stellar interior , calculated as a function of the baryon ( rest ) mass of protoneutron star , is presented in section 5 . 
 then , in section 6 we show the validity of an empirical formula , which enables one to express with a surprisingly high precision the maximum frequency of rotating protoneutron stars in terms of the mass and radius of the maximum mass configuration of static ( non - rotating ) protoneutron stars with same eos . in section 7 
 we study the evolutionary transformation of a rotating protoneutron star into a cold neutron star . 
 we show that , at fixed rest mass and angular momentum , maximum rotation frequency of protoneutron stars imposes severe constraints on the rotation frequency of solitary neutron stars . 
 finally , section 8 contains discussion of our results and conclusion . 
 we consider a protoneutron star ( pns ) just after its formation . 
 we assume it has a well defined `` neutrinosphere '' , which separates a hot , neutrino - opaque interior from colder , neutrino - transparent outer envelope . 
 important parameters , which determine the local state of the matter in the hot interior are : baryon ( nucleon ) number density @xmath11 , net electron fraction @xmath12 , and the net electron - neutrino fraction @xmath13 . the calculation of the composition of hot matter and of its eos is described below . 
 such a situation is characteristic of the very initial stage of existence of a pns . 
 matter is composed of nucleons ( both free and bound in nuclei ) and leptons ( electrons and neutrinos ; for simplicity , we do not include muons ) . 
 all constituents of the matter ( plus photons ) are in thermodynamic equilibrium at given values of @xmath11 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . 
 the composition of the matter is calculated from the condition of beta equilibrium , combined with the condition of a fixed @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the chemical potentials of matter constituents . at the very initial stage 
 we expect @xmath19 . 
 electron neutrinos are degenerate , with @xmath20 ( in what follows we measure @xmath14 in energy units ) . 
 the deleptonization , implying the decrease of @xmath16 , occurs due to diffusion of neutrinos outward ( driven by the @xmath21 gradient ) , on a timescale of seconds ( sawyer & soni 1979 , bombaci et al . 
 the diffusion of highly degenerate neutrinos from the central core is a dissipative process , resulting in a significant _ heating _ of the neutrino - opaque core ( burrows & lattimer 1986 ) . 
 this is the limiting case , reached after complete deleptonization . 
 there is no trapped lepton number , so that @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and therefore @xmath25 . 
 neutrinos trapped within the hot interior do not influence the beta equilibrium of nucleons , electrons and positrons , and for given @xmath11 and @xmath14 the equilibrium value of @xmath26 is determined from @xmath27 while @xmath28 . in practice , this approximation can be used as soon as electron neutrinos become non - degenerate within the opaque core , @xmath29 , which occurs after some @xmath30 seconds ( sawyer & soni 1979 , bombaci et al . 
 the neutrino diffusion is then driven by the temperature gradient , and the corresponding timescale of the heat transport ( pns cooling ) can be estimated as @xmath31  s ( sawyer & soni 1979 ) .      in principle , 
 the temperature ( or entropy per nucleon ) profile within a pns has to be determined via evolutionary calculation , starting from some initial state , and taking into account relevant transport processes in the pns interior , as well as neutrino emission from pns . 
 transport processes within neutrino - opaque interior occur on timescales of seconds , some three orders of magnitude longer than dynamical timescales . 
 the very outer layer of pns becomes rapidly transparent to neutrinos , deleptonizes , and cools on a very short timescale via @xmath32 pair annihilation and plasmon decay . 
 it seemed thus natural to model the thermal structure of the pns interior by a hot core limited by a `` neutrinosphere '' , and an outer envelope of   @xmath33 mev . 
 the transition through the `` neutrinosphere '' is accompanied by a temperature drop , which takes place over some interval of density just above the `` edge''of the hot neutrino - opaque core , situated at some @xmath34 .    in view of the uncertainties in the actual temperature profiles within the hot interior of pns , we considered two extremal situations for @xmath35 , corresponding to an isentropic and an isothermal hot interior . in the first case , 
 hot interior was characterized by a constant entropy per baryon @xmath10 . in the case of trapped lepton number 
 , this leads to the eos of the type : pressure @xmath36)$ ] , energy density @xmath37)$ ] , and temperature @xmath38)$ ] , with fixed @xmath39 and @xmath16 . 
 this eos will be denoted by eos[@xmath40 . in the case of an isentropic , 
 zero trapped lepton number eos , we will have eos[@xmath41 . 
 the condition of isothermality , which corresponds to thermal equilibrium , is more complicated . due to the curvature of the space - time within pns 
 , the condition of isothermality corresponds to the constancy of @xmath42 ( see section 3.1 ) . 
 the significance of the @xmath43 condition will be discussed in section 3.1 . in the static case 
 , the isothermal state within the hot interior will be reached on a timescale corresponding to thermal equilibration , which is much longer than the lifetime of a pns . in the case of a rotating pns 
 , the situation can be expected to be even more complicated ( see , e.g. , chapter 8 of tassoul ( 1978 ) ) . nevertheless , we considered the @xmath43 models for several reasons . 
 first , as a limiting case so different from the @xmath10 one , it enables us to check the dependence of our results for rapidly rotating pns on the thermal state of the hot interior . moreover , for the isothermal pns we can apply the criterion of stability with respect to the axi - symmetric perturbations , and this will enable us to calculate the value of @xmath3 for the stable supramassive rotating pns models with an isothermal interior ( see section 3 ) . 
 our calculation of the `` neutrinosphere '' within the hot pns interior was done using a simple method , described below . for a given 
 pns model , the neutrinosphere radius , @xmath44 , has been located through the condition @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the neutrino mean free path which is calculated at the matter temperature @xmath14 , while @xmath47 is the mean energy of non - degenerate neutrinos at ( and above ) the neutrinosphere , @xmath48 . 
 we assumed that opacity above @xmath44 is dominated by the elastic scattering off nuclei and nucleons , so that @xmath49 . then , we determined the value of the density at the neutrinosphere , @xmath34 , for a given static pns model , combining eq . 
 ( [ r_nu ] ) with that of hydrostatic equilibrium , and readjusting accordingly the temperature profile within the outer layers of pns . 
 this value of @xmath34 was then used in the calculations of rotating pns models . let us notice 
 , that similar approximation , in which the `` neutrinosphere '' in rapidly rotating protoneutron star was defined as a surface of constant density , was used by janka and moenchmeyer ( 1989a , b ) . some details concerning actual calculation of the temperature profile in the vicinity of the `` neutrinosphere '' will be given in subsection 3.3 .      the starting point for the construction of our eos for the pns models 
 was the model of hot dense matter of lattimer and swesty ( 1991 ) , hereafter referred to as ls . 
 actually , we used one specific ls model , corresponding to the incompressibility modulus at the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter @xmath50mev . 
 for @xmath35 we supplemented the ls model with contributions resulting from the presence of trapped neutrinos of three flavours ( electronic , muonic and tauonic ) and of the corresponding antineutrinos .    in fig . 
 1a , b we show our eos in several cases , corresponding to various physical conditions in the hot , neutrino - opaque interior of pns . for the sake of comparison , 
 we have shown also the eos for cold catalyzed matter , used for the calculation of the ( cold ) ns models . in fig . 
 1a we show eos at subnuclear densities . at these densities , both the temperature and the presence of trapped neutrinos stiffen the eos , as compared to the cold catalyzed matter one , and the stiffening is rather dramatic . 
 the constant @xmath14 eos stiffens considerably at lower densities , which is due to the weak dependence of the thermal contribution ( photons , neutrinos ) on the baryon density of the matter ( this effect will be to some extent moderated by the factor @xmath51 in the isothermal pns , see section 3.1 ) . 
 it is quite obvious , that @xmath5 eos becomes dominated by thermal effects below for @xmath52 . on the contrary , for isentropic eos 
 , the effect of the trapped lepton number ( @xmath53 ) turns out to be much more important than the thermal effects . 
 this can be see in fig . 
 1a , by comparing dash - dotted curve , @xmath54 $ ] , with the dotted line , which corresponds to an artificial ( unphysical ) case with small thermal effects , @xmath55 $ ] . 
 it is clear , that the correct location of the `` neutrinosphere '' , which separates hot interior from the colder outer envelope , should be important for the determination of the radius of pns , and in consequence , of the maximum rotation frequency of a given pns model 
 .    it may be useful to compare our subnuclear eos for pns with those used by other authors . 
 the subnuclear eos of pns , used in the papers of hashimoto et al . 
 ( 1995 ) and bombaci et al . 
 ( 1995 , 96 ) is very different from that used in the present paper . 
 in particular , hashimoto et al . ( 
 1995 ) used a cold ( @xmath9 ) eos for the densities below @xmath56 . on the other hand , bombaci et al . 
 ( 1995 , 96 ) stop their hot eos at the edge of the liquid interior , and use the @xmath9 ( cold catalyzed matter ) eos for the densities below @xmath57 ; in this way , they seriously underestimate thermal and neutrino trapping effects on the radius of pns .    our eos above nuclear density are plotted in fig . 
 the presence of a trapped lepton number softens the eos , while thermal effects always stiffen it with respect to that for cold catalyzed matter . 
 the softening of the supranuclear eos at fixed @xmath16 is due to the fact , that a significant trapped lepton number increases the proton fraction , which implies the softening of the nucleon contribution to the eos . 
 it should be stressed , that in contrast to hashimoto et al . 
 ( 1995 ) and bombaci et al . 
 ( 1995 , 96 ) we used a unified dense matter model , valid for both supranuclear and subnuclear densities . 
 also , the fact that we use various assumptions about the @xmath14 and @xmath39 profiles within pns , enables us to study the relative importance of the temperature profile and that of a trapped lepton number , for the pns models . 
 the mass - radius relation for the static pns models calculated using various versions of our eos for the hot interior is shown in fig . 
 we assumed @xmath58 , which was consistent with our definition of the `` neutrinosphere '' . 
 for the sake of comparison , we show also the mass - radius relation for the @xmath9 ( cold catalyzed matter ) eos , which corresponds to cold neutron star models . in the case of the isothermal hot interior with central temperature @xmath59  mev we note a very small increase of the maximum mass , as compared to the @xmath9 case ( c.f . 
 , bombaci et al . 1995 , 1996 ) . 
 however , the effect on the mass - radius relation is quite strong , and increases rapidly with decreasing stellar mass . in the case of the isentropic eos with a trapped lepton number , [ @xmath60 
 , the softening of the high - density eos due to the trapped @xmath16 leads to the decrease of @xmath61 compared to the @xmath9 case ; as far as the value of @xmath61 is concerned , the softening effect of @xmath16 prevails over that of finite @xmath39 ( this is consistent with results of takatsuka 1995 and bombaci et al . 
 1995 , 1996 ) . 
 however , the thermal effect on the radius is very important even in the case of @xmath53 . 
 this can be seen by comparing the @xmath54 $ ] curve with that corresponding to the unphysical , fictitious case of @xmath55 $ ] . 
 the very initial state of a pns corresponds to a significant trapped lepton number . with our assumption of a `` standard '' composition of dense matter ( i , e . 
 , excluding large amplitude @xmath0-condensate , or a very large percentage of hyperons in cold dense matter ) , the maximum baryon mass ( baryon number ) of pns is lower than that of cold ns . 
 therefore , in our case a stable pns transforms into a stable ns , and the scenario pns@xmath62black hole , considered by baumgarte et al . 
 ( 1996 ) is excluded .    at a given mass , 
 the radius of a pns is significantly larger than that of a cold ns . as remarked by hashimoto et al . 
 ( 1995 ) , this should have important implications for rotating pns 
 . it should be stressed , however , that the value of radius , especially for pns which are not close to the @xmath61 configuration , turns out to be quite sensitive to the location of the edge of the hot neutrino - opaque interior ( i.e. , to the value of @xmath34 ) . the choice of bombaci et al . 
 ( 1996 ) would lead to a much smaller effect on @xmath63 , while that of hashimoto et al . 
 ( 1995 ) would result in larger values of the pns radii . 
 the eos of pns is evolving with time , due mainly to the deleptonization process , which changes the composition of matter , and also due to changes of the internal temperature of the star . 
 however , these changes occur on the timescales @xmath641 - 10  s , which are three or more orders of magnitude longer than the dynamical timescale , governing the readjustment of pressure and gravity forces . 
 this dynamical timescale @xmath65ms corresponds also to the characteristic periods of the pns pulsations and of their rapid rotation . in view of this , we are able to decouple pns evolution from its dynamics , and treat its rotation in the stationary approximation , with a well defined eos of the pns matter 
 .    one of the neglected dynamical processes , implied by the radiative processes and the evolution of the thermal structure of a rotating pns , is the meridional circulation of the matter . 
 strictly uniform rotation is incompatible with an assumption of a steady thermal state , resulting from the diffusive ( radiative ) equilibrium ( see , e.g. , tassoul 1978 ) . 
 the requirement of radiative equilibrium will necessarily imply the existence of a meridional circulation of the matter . 
 however , the velocity of this meridional circulation will be of the order of the stellar radius divided by the thermal timescale ( the timescale of changes of the entropy of the pns interior , which is of the order of neutrino diffusion timescale ) , which is much smaller than the rotational velocity ( see , eg . , 
 section 8 of tassoul 1978 ) . in view of this 
 , we can neglect the effect of the meridional circulation when calculating the mechanical equilibrium of a rapidly rotating pns . 
 finally , let us notice that in a special , idealized case of @xmath66 , the radiative flux vanishes . 
 then , pure uniform rotation can be realized as a steady state of a pns . 
 the problem of the calculation of the stationary state of uniform rotation of cold neutron stars , within the framework of general relativity , was considered by numerous authors ( see the review article of friedman and ipser 1992 , and references therein ) . 
 extensive calculations for a broad set of realistic equations of state of cold dense matter were recently presented in ( cook et al . 1994 ) and ( salgado et al . 1994 ) . here , we will extend the methods used at @xmath9 to the case of hot pns . 
 we will use the notation and formalism developed in the paper of bonazzola et al . 
 ( 1993 ) , hereafter referred to as bgsm . 
 one of the problems introduced by finite temperature is that , if one does not make any other assumption about the equilibrium , the equation of stationary motion does not have a first integral ( bardeen 1972 ) .    in the notation of bgsm , the equation of stationary motion ( eq 
 . 3.25 of bgsm ) reads , when the effects of temperature and rigid rotation are included , as @xmath67 where @xmath39 is the entropy per baryon , @xmath14 is the temperature , and @xmath68 $ ] is the so - called pseudo - enthalpy ( or log - enthalpy ) , @xmath7 is the lapse function appearing in the space - time metric , and @xmath8 is the lorentz factor due to rotation . 
 the equation of the stationary motion is to be supplemented with the equations determining the metric functions ( see bsgm for the derivation and the explicit form of the complete set of equations ) .    in the expression for @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the energy density ( which includes rest energy of matter constituents ) and @xmath71 is the nucleon rest mass . 
 this equation is the general relativistic equivalent of a well - known newtonian formula ( see e.g. tassoul 1978 ) . 
 it is straightforward to show that a _ sufficient _ condition for ( [ eqsta ] ) to be integrable is @xmath72 . in this case , one obtains a first integral of motion of the form : @xmath73 this enables us to calculate the density profile in the envelope of the pns , because we have assumed a specific @xmath74 profile within it ( see section 3.3 ) . 
 let us stress that , due to the integral term in ( [ firstint ] ) , the pseudo - enthalphy is no more an explicit function of the metric potentials , as it was in bgsm . 
 in fact , one must solve ( [ firstint ] ) to have @xmath69 within the star .    in the two particular cases , chosen by us for the hot interior , specific first integrals of eq . 
 ( [ eqsta ] ) can be found . 
 first , in the case of general relativistic thermal equilibrium , @xmath75 , it is easy to show that @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the baryon chemical potential , is indeed the integral of ( [ eqsta ] ) . 
 the constancy of @xmath78 and @xmath79 corresponds to the general - relativistic thermodynamic equilibrium , if we neglect the time dependence of the eos of pns ( i.e. , if we freeze transport phenomena ) . 
 second , in the case of isentropic profile @xmath80 , the thermal term in ( [ eqsta ] ) vanishes and the first integral of eq . 
 ( [ eqsta ] ) reads @xmath81      the instabilities that could develop in rapidly rotating pns , and which could limit the maximum angular frequency of these objects , are of secular and of dynamic type . 
 let us start with the problem of secular stability with respect to the axi - symmetric perturbation of rotating configurations . 
 we denote the total baryon number , total angular momentum , and total entropy of a pns by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , respectively . 
 we used the _ secular _ instability criterion of friedman et al . 
 ( 1988 ) , extended to the case of finite temperature . for the purpose of completeness , we restate here their lemma ( and correct a misprint of their paper ) . + 
 * lemma :* consider a three - parameter family of uniformly rotating hot stellar models having an equation of state of the form @xmath85 . 
 suppose that along a continous sequence of models labelled by a parameter @xmath86 , there is a point @xmath87 at which @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 vanish and where @xmath91 . 
 then the part of the sequence for which @xmath92 is unstable for @xmath86 near @xmath87 . 
 + similarly as in the case of friedman et al . ( 
 1988 ) , this lemma follows directly from theorem i of sorkin ( 1982 ) , with his function @xmath84 replaced by @xmath93 , the @xmath94 quantities replaced by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and the @xmath95 ones by @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 . 
 the conditions of the theorem are fulfilled because stellar models are configurations for which @xmath99 is minimized at fixed @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , _ and _ because difference in @xmath99 between two neighbouring equilibria can be expressed as ( bardeen 1970 ) @xmath100 let us stress here that this last equation requires either @xmath98 or @xmath39 to be constant through the whole star , which fixes , in each of these two cases , the temperature profile within the stellar model . 
 we investigated the stability of our models with a specific version of this criterion , in which we choose a continous sequence of equilibria to be a sequence at fixed @xmath82 and @xmath84 . 
 the point of the loss of stability is then simply the point of extremal @xmath83 , i.e. : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the central density of the star . 
 the instability discussed above is a secular one ; it will develop on the timescale needed to transport the angular momentum within the perturbed model , in order to decrease the energy of the star while changing its shape and structure . 
 however , the timescale of the pns evolution is quite short ( seconds ) , and it is driven by the same transport processes involving neutrinos , as those which are needed to destabilize the star via the axi - symmetric perturbations . in view of this , one might expect that the secular instability described above is not efficient in disrupting the quasi - stationary configuration of rapidly rotating pns . 
 however , we should remember that the above considerations apply to the case of infinitesimal perturbations . 
 transport processes would be crucial for removing the energy barrier separating the initial , secularly unstable configuration , from the dynamically unstable one , which would eventually collapse into a black hole . however , newly born pns are expected to be in a highly excited state , in which various modes of stellar pulsations are excited . 
 one may expect that the energy contained in these pulsations is sufficient to overcome the energy barrier separating the actual metastable , secularly unstable state from the dynamically unstable , collapsing one . in view of this 
 , we expect that the secularly unstable configurations should be treated like unstable ones . 
 therefore , the critical configuration , given by eq.(9 ) , will be thus considered as the last stable one . 
 a rapidly rotating pns can be also susceptible to other types of secular instabilities . 
 the instability with respect to the non axisymmetric perturbations can be driven by the gravitational radiation reaction ( grr ) . however , detailed calculations performed for hot ns suggest , that at the temperature exceeding @xmath103k these instabilities can only slightly decrease the maximum rotation frequency of uniform rotation , due to the damping effect of the matter viscosity ( cutler et al . 
 1990 , ipser & lindblom 1991 , lindblom 1995 , yoshida & eriguchi 1995 , zdunik 1996 ) . 
 secular instabilities of rapidly rotating ns with respect to the non - axisymmetric `` bar '' mode were recently investigated by lai & shapiro ( 1995 ) and bonazzola et al . 
 while lai & shapiro ( 1995 ) addressed the problem of `` bar '' instability of newly formed ns , they assumed a rather unrealistic `` ellipsoidal model '' , involving only shear viscosity as a source of viscous dissipation , and performed their calculations within the newtonian theory of gravity . on the other hand , in their relativistic calculations bonazzola et al . 
 ( 1995 ) considered only cold ns , and found that the secular `` bar '' instability can set in before the keplerian ( mass shedding ) limit is reached only for sufficiently stiff eos of ns matter . 
 the problem of the `` bar '' instability of pns , with realistic eos of the hot interior , will be investigated by us in the future . in any case , 
 inclusion of possible additional secular instabilities can only decrease the maximum rotation frequency of pns below the values obtained using the simplified approach adapted in the present paper . 
 the fact of the existence of the maximum mass of rotating pns , @xmath104 ( and maximum baryon mass , @xmath105 ) ( see section 5 ) , puts a well defined and stringent limit on @xmath106 which can be reached by pns . 
 configurations with @xmath107 are _ dynamically unstable _ : no stationary solution exists above @xmath108 . at the same time , the angular frequency of rigid rotation can not exceed the keplerian value , @xmath106 . 
 these two conditions , combined with the instability criterion , expressed in eq . 
 ( 9 ) , determine the maximum frequency ( or , strictly speaking , an upper bound on the frequency ) of rigid rotation of pns . 
 practical implementation of these criteria will be described in section 5 . 
 a consistent study of pns would require an exact treatment of the thermal transport in the frame of a non - stationary spacetime . 
 unfortunately , such a study is beyond the scope of the present work , and we have thus chosen to impose `` by hand '' the temperature profile within the star , following prescription described in the subsection 2.3 . 
 we divided the interior of pns into the hot interior ( @xmath109 ) , a layer corresponding to the temperature drop within the `` neutrinosphere '' ( @xmath110 ) , and the low temperature , neutrino - transparent outer envelope with @xmath111 . 
 we have chosen two types of temperature profiles within the hot , neutrino - opaque core @xmath112 :    * the isothermal profile : @xmath113 , with @xmath114 , * the isentropic profile : @xmath115 , with @xmath116 . 
 for the transition region and the low temperature envelope , we used a suitable profile @xmath74 : @xmath117 the function @xmath118 was chosen for computational convenience as a suitable combination of an exponential and a gaussian function , selected to lead to @xmath74 of class @xmath119 through the transition ( temperature drop ) region . 
 our typical choice was @xmath120 ; increasing this value up @xmath121 led to a very small increase of the stellar radius . 
 as the mass of a massive pns is almost entirely contained in the hot neutrino - opaque core ( a rough estimate for a typical star gives less than @xmath122 of the total mass for the cool envelope mass ) , we supposed that our stability criterion remained valid also in the case of the presence of the low temperature envelope . 
 we used a code based on the @xmath123 formulation of the einstein equations in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes ( bgsm ) . 
 the four elliptic equations obtained were solved by means of a spectral method , in which the functions are expanded in different polynomial bases ( chebyshev for @xmath124 , legendre for @xmath125 and fourier for @xmath126 ) . 
 we refer the reader to bgsm for a detailed description of the code , including the description of the `` virial '' indicator used for monitoring the convergence and the precision reached . 
 let us just say that the code was modified to take into account thermal effects and , contrary to salgado et al . 
 ( 1994 ) , to converge to the solution with various quantities being held fixed ( for example @xmath127 or @xmath83 or @xmath84 ) . 
 here we briefly outline some of the numerical checks we made . 
 the two - parameters eos was interpolated using bicubic splines subroutine from the nag library . in this way , the thermodynamic functions are of class @xmath128 , but the thermodynamic consistency is not conserved . 
 the global relative error , evaluated by the means of the virial check ( see bgsm ) , is @xmath129 . 
 this relatively `` low '' precision is due to the thermodynamical inconsistencies . 
 we used two grids in @xmath124 for the star and one in @xmath130 for the exterior with @xmath131 in each , and one grid in @xmath125 with @xmath132 . 
 we checked that a greater @xmath133 or @xmath134 does not change the results by more than a few @xmath135 at most , which stays within the global precision reached . 
 let us stress that such a low number of grid points is sufficient to reach high accuracy within a spectral method ( that would not be the case with a finite difference scheme ) . 
 the temperature drop at the `` neutrinosphere '' is not always located on the border of the internal grid in @xmath124 , which could influence the precision ( remember that the spectral methods are very sensitive to discontinuities ) . 
 we checked that , in fact , even when the `` neutrinosphere '' is far from the border of the grid , the global physical quantities of the star did not change much ( we found also relative variations of a few @xmath135 at most ) . 
 for a `` simple '' model where @xmath136 were held fixed , convergence required no more than @xmath137 iterations and @xmath138 minute of cpu time on a silicon graphix indigo@xmath139 workstation . however , the number of iterations can reach @xmath140 if one needs to converge to , e.g. , a keplerian configuration at fixed supra - massive baryon mass . 
 finally , we compared our results at @xmath9 and @xmath141 with the results of another code used by one of us ( p. haensel ) , and found that the relative differences in the global properties of the stellar models are of the order of @xmath142 , which can be imputed to the different interpolation procedures . 
 for a given eos , rapidly rotating pns models can be divided into two families : normal and supramassive one . 
 normal models are those with baryon mass which does not exceed the maximum allowable baryon mass of static ( non - rotating ) configurations , @xmath143 . a _ normal _ rotating model can be transformed into a static configuration of the same baryon mass , through a continuous decrease of @xmath97 . 
 rotation of pns increases their maximum allowable mass with respect to the static case , up to @xmath144 . 
 rotating pns models with @xmath145 are called _ 
 supramassive_. such a supramassive rotating model can not transform into a static model , because in the process of decreasing angular velocity it will collapse into a black hole .    the maximum angular velocity of the normal and supramassive rotating models results from different stability conditions . in the case of normal rotating configurations 
 the value of @xmath97 is bound by the mass shedding limit , which corresponds to the keplerian velocity at the stellar equator , @xmath146 . 
 the value of @xmath106 turns out to be rather sensitive to the location of the `` neutrinosphere '' within the pns . 
 this sensitivity is particularly large in the case of the isothermal profile of the hot neutrino - opaque core . 
 this is visualized in fig . 
 3 , where we show the dependence of the mass shedding limit @xmath106 for pns with baryon mass @xmath147 on the value of @xmath34 , for the central temperatures ranging between 10 and 20 mev . the dependence on the value of @xmath34 weakens with increasing @xmath127 . also , this effect is much less important in the case of isentropic pns .

 our calculations have been performed for both isothermal ( @xmath43 ) and isentropic ( @xmath10 ) hot interiors of pns . in both cases , 
 the absolute maximum of keplerian frequency for rotating models , which were stable with respect to the axi - symmetric perturbations , was obtained for a rotating configuration with a maximum baryonic mass ( and gravitational mass ) , @xmath157 [ @xmath104 ] . actually , rotating configuration with @xmath104 and that with @xmath2 do not generally coincide ( see , e.g. , cook et al . 
 1994 , stergioulas & friedman 1995 ) . 
 however , the difference is very small , and it could not be detected within the precision of our numerical code . 
 the value @xmath104 depends on the value of @xmath78 in the case of isothermal hot interior , but we preferred to parametrize it in terms of central temperature , @xmath159 . 
 the dependence of @xmath104 on the value of @xmath160 is displayed in fig . 
 4 a. the effect of temperature on @xmath104 is opposite to that seen for @xmath148 : thermal effects lower the value of @xmath104 as compared to that for cold neutron stars . 
 this is due to the thermal increase of the equatorial radius , which prevails over the thermal stiffening of the central core of pns . 
 the dependence of @xmath161 on the value of @xmath39 in the case of isentropic hot interior of pns is represented in fig . 
 4 b , in the case of @xmath162 ( trapped lepton number ) and for @xmath53 . 
 the decrease of @xmath161 is there smaller than in the case of the isothermal pns models .    in fig . 
 5 a , 5 b we show our results for the maximum rotation frequency of stable pns models , reached for supramassive configurations . in the case of the isothermal pns , thermal effects tend to decrease the value of @xmath2 , but even in the case of @xmath163mev the relative effect does not exceed ten percent . 
 irregularities at lower @xmath160 result from the limited accuracy of determination of the critical configuration with an isothermal core . 
 maximum rotation frequency in the case of the isentropic hot neutrino - trapped cores of pns is shown , for several values of the central entropy per baryon , in fig . 
 5 b. the value of @xmath2 is also decreasing with increasing @xmath39 .    in general , we find that the decrease of @xmath2 , as compared to cold neutron stars , is in our case smaller than that found by hashimoto et al . 
 ( 1995 ) ; this may be due to the lower value of the density at the edge of the hot core , assumed by these authors . 
 some differences may also be due to different supranuclear eos , and to a different treatment of the thermal effects , in particular , to their assumption of @xmath5 . in order to visualize the importance of the relativistic effects on @xmath164 in the isothermal interior of a pns 
 , we show in fig . 
 6 the temperatures @xmath164 and @xmath78 , for @xmath165 @xmath166 , and a uniform keplerian rotation . 
 as one can see , in the central part of the pns , @xmath14 is about @xmath167 percent greater than @xmath168 . 
 a similar effect is seen also in the case of an isentropic hot interior , which in fig . 
 6 corresponds to @xmath169 . 
 the calculation of the rotating pns ( and ns ) models is incomparably more difficult than that of the static models . in the case of cold ns , 
 one finds a surprisingly precise universal formula , which relates the maximum rotation frequency to the mass and radius of the maximum mass configuration for the static models ( haensel & zdunik 1989 , friedman at al . 
 1989 , shapiro et al . 
 1989 , haensel et al . 
 1995 , nozawa et al . 
 1996 ) , @xmath170 where the most recent value of @xmath171 , based on calculations performed for a broad set of realistic _ 
 cold _ eos of dense matter , is @xmath172 ( haensel et al . 1995 ) . 
 the `` empirical formula '' , eq . 
 ( 10 ) , reproduces the values of @xmath2 for cold ns models with typical precision better than @xmath173 ( although in some specific cases the deviations can reach nearly @xmath174 , see nozawa et al . 
 1996 ) . 
 the validity of the empirical formula for @xmath2 is of great practical importance . for cold eos of dense matter 
 , it enables one to get immediately a rather precise estimate of the value of @xmath2 , using easily calculated static neutron star models , and avoiding in this way incomparably more difficult 2-d calculations of rotating ns models and the analysis of their stability . 
 it is of interest to check , whether `` empirical formula '' is valid also in the case of hot pns . let us notice , that the subnuclear eos of pns , with possible lepton number trapping , is very different from that of cold catalyzed matter ( see fig 
 . 1 ) . in order to check the validity of the empirical formula 
 , we define the eos depending parameter @xmath175 , @xmath176 where the right - hand - side is calculated using exact results for a specific eos . 
 the values of @xmath175 for our models of pns are displayed in fig . 
 7 a , 7 b. let us notice , that for isentropic hot cores with trapped lepton number the value of @xmath175 shows a decreasing trend with increasing @xmath39 . in the case of isothermal hot cores with @xmath153 we see the opposite trend : the value of @xmath175 tends to increase with central temperature . 
 the value of @xmath177 will lead to a very good empirical formula for pns , with precison comparable to that used for cold ns . within the precision of the empirical formulae , 
 the values of @xmath178 and @xmath179 can be considered as being equal . 
 maximum rotation frequencies and maximum baryon masses of pns with various eos , and corresponding frequencies of cold ns configurations , obtained via cooling at constant @xmath83 and @xmath127 ( @xmath83-losses due to neutrino emission are neglected ) . [ cols= "" < , < , 
 < , < "" , ]     rapidly rotating hot , neutrino - opaque pns evolves eventually into a cold , rotating ns , which under favourable circumstances can be observed as a solitary pulsar . 
 let us assume , that such a transformation took place at constant baryon mass : this assumption is valid if mass accreted after the formation of a pns is negligibly small . 
 ( notice , that we can _ define _ the moment of formation of a pns as that at which the accretion ends ) . 
 second assumption refers to the angular momentum of the star . 
 let us neglect for the time being the angular momentum loss due to emission of neutrinos ( mainly during deleptonization ) , as well as that due to gravitational radiation ( if rotating star deviated from the axial symmetry ) . 
 inclusion of both effects could only _ decrease _ the final angular momentum of the ns . under these two assumptions , 
 the transformation of a pns into a solitary radio pulsar takes place at constant baryon mass , @xmath127 , and angular momentum , @xmath83 . 
 the maximum angular frequency of a solitary radio pulsar of a given baryon mass would be then determined by the parameters of a maximally rotating pns of the same baryon mass .    in the present paper 
 we restrict ourselves , similarly as hashimoto et al . 
 ( 1995 ) , to the case of rigid rotation of pns . 
 we will first consider `` typical '' range of baryon masses expected for the ns born in a gravitational collapse of a massive stellar core , @xmath180 ( for our eos of dense matter this would correspond to @xmath181 ) . 
 all stars considered are normal , and the maximum initial frequency of pns will be then @xmath182 $ ] , and @xmath183 $ ] , for the limiting case of the zero trapped lepton number , and maximum trapped lepton number neutrino - opaque cores , respectively . 
 the values of these limiting angular frequencies , for the isothermal and isentropic pns cores , are plotted versus @xmath127 in fig . 8 ( thin dashed and dash - dotted lines , respectively ) .    our results displayed in fig . 
 8 lead to some conclusions , relevant to those neutron stars which remained solitary after their birth in the gravitational collapse of a massive stellar core . 
 if the starting configuration ( at the end of significant accretion , after the revival of a stagnated shock ) was that with trapped lepton number and isentropic , then the maximum frequency of such a neutron star , in the gravitational mass range of 1.3 - 1.8  @xmath184 , can not exceed 600 - 900  hz , the lower frequency limit corresponding to the lower mass limit . 
 the corresponding range of minimum periods would be from 1.6  ms to 1.1  ms , respectively .    if the `` initial isolated configuration '' ( i.e. , that with no subsequent accretion ) was a little older , and therefore deleptonized , and if we assume that it was isothermal , then the resulting constraints would be less stringent : for the range of masses 1.3 - 1.8  @xmath184 we get minimum rotation periods of 1.25 - 1.1  ms , respectively .    in both cases cooling resulted in speeding up of the rotation of the star : 
 such situation is characteristic of `` normal rotating models '' . 
 similar evolutionary considerations can be applied to the `` maximally rotating configurations '' : isentropic one with @xmath169 and isothermal ones with @xmath185mev ,  25  mev , respectively . 
 our results are shown in table 2 . 
 the initial `` hot '' configurations are supramassive , and evolve into more compact cool ones ( at constant @xmath186 and @xmath83 ) _ decreasing _ their angular frequency ( slowing down ) . 
 this purely relativistic effect was recently pointed out by hashimoto et al . 
 the `` relativistic slowing down '' during cooling of the maximally rotating isentropic configuration with @xmath169 corresponds to the increase of the period from @xmath187=0.72 $ ]  ms up to @xmath188  ms . 
 if such a scenario of formation of solitary pulsars is valid , an absolute limit on their period would be @xmath189 , and not @xmath190  ms , obtained for the @xmath9 eos . 
 the slowing down factor of @xmath191 coincides with that obtained by hashimoto et al . 
 ( 1995 ) for a different eos and a different scenario of formation of solitary cold pulsars . 
 actually , they assumed that the initial configuration is that with @xmath192 . 
 their initial model would to some extent correspond to our isothermal models ( remember however the factor @xmath193 in our temperature profiles , which is absent in their calculations ) . using tables 1 , 2 we obtain @xmath194/p_{\rm min}[t=0]=0.92 $ ] , which is quite close to 1 . 
 in the present paper we studied rapid rotation of protoneutron stars , using a specific model of hot , dense matter . 
 our models of rapidly rotating protoneutron stars were based on several simplifications , which were necessary in order to make the problem tractable . in order to avoid difficulties and/or ambiguities of the largely unknown `` real situation '' , we restricted ourselves to studying idealized , limiting cases . 
 in many places we introduced approximations , which were crucial for making numerical calculations feasible . 
 we assumed rigid rotation within protoneutron star . 
 this simplified greatly our considerations , and reduced dramatically the number of stellar models . 
 actually , our formalism allows calculation of the quasi - stationary differentially rotating configurations , after introducing an additional @xmath195 term appearing on the right hand side of the equation of stationary motion , eq . 
 ( 4 ) ( see section 5.1 of bgsm ) . 
 we plan to perform studies of differentially rotating protoneutron stars in the near future , as the next step in our investigations of dynamics of protoneutron stars . 
 while existing numerical simulations of gravitational collapse of rotating cores of massive stars yield a differentially rotating protoneutron star , the calculations stop too early after bounce . 
 in contrast to our models of protoneutron stars , the object which comes out from the simulations of moenchmeyer and mueller has an extended , very hot envelope , produced by the shock wave immediately after bounce ( janka & moenchmeyer 1989a , b , moenchmeyer & mueller 1989 ) . 
 also , the lack of knowledge of the initial angular velocity distribution within the collapsing core results in the uncertainty in the rotational state of produced protoneutron star . clearly , the study of quasistationary differential rotation of protoneutron stars should take into account all these uncertainties . 
 deleptonization of protoneutron star is connected with energy and angular momentum losses . 
 however , angular momentum taken away by neutrinos is expected to constitute at most a few percent of the total stellar angular momentum ( kazanas 1977 ) . 
 inclusion of this effect would slightly decrease some of our `` evolutionary limits '' of section 7 . 
 our treatment of the thermal state of the protoneutron star interior should be considered as very crude . 
 the temperature profile might be affected by convection . also , our method of locating the `` neutrinosphere '' was very approximate . 
 clearly , the treatment of thermal effects can be refined , but we do not think this will change our main results . 
 our calculations were performed for only one model of the nucleon component of dense hot matter . 
 the model was realistic , and enabled us to treat in a unified way the whole interior ( core as well as the envelope ) of the protoneutron star . 
 however , in view of the uncertainties in the eos of dense matter at supranuclear densities , one should of course study the whole range of theoretical possibilities , for a broad set - from soft to stiff - of supranuclear , high temperature eos . 
 an example of such an investigation , in the case of the _ static _ protoneutron stars , is the study of bombaci et al . 
 ( 1996 ) . in view of the possible importance of the protoneutron star - neutron star connection for the properties of solitary pulsars , similar studies should also be done for rotating proto - neutron stars . 
 the calculations of the present paper were done under the assumption , that the frequency of uniform rotation of protoneutron stars is limited only by the mass shedding and the secular instability with respect to the axi - symmetric perturbations . in view of this , our results can be considered only as upper bounds to the maximum rotation frequency . 
 our main conclusion is that the minimum rotation period of solitary neutron stars , born as rapidly rotating protoneutron stars , is significantly larger , than the corresponding limit for cold neutron stars . 
 inclusion of additional secular instabilities in rapidly , uniformly rotating protoneutron stars can only strengthen this conclusion .

 we are also very grateful to w. dziembowski for introducing us into the difficult subject of meridional circulation .

54,"derived within linear response theory , the fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) predicts how the response function of a thermodynamic observable is related to correlation of thermal fluctuations at equilibrium . 
 let us assume that an equilibrium system described by a hamiltonian @xmath0 is perturbed at time @xmath1 by an external force @xmath2 . 
 the fdt predicts a response at a later time @xmath3 
 @xcite r^eq_a(t_2-t_1 ) = = a(t_2 ) [ -_h h(t_1)]_h=0_eq [ fdt - eq ] where the correlation is calculated at equilibrium corresponding to temperature @xmath4 with @xmath5 . the differential operator @xmath6 in the above relation denotes the scalar derivative evaluated at time @xmath7 . 
 thus @xmath8 is the displacement conjugate to @xmath9 with respect to the hamiltonian . throughout this paper 
 we use boltzman constant @xmath10 , unless otherwise stated . using the onsager regression hypothesis 
 the fdt can be interpreted as follows  the decay of a fluctuation is independent of how it has been created , under the influence of a small applied force or spontaneously by thermal noise . 
 the fdt is violated away from equilibrium regime and this violation has been studied in context of glassy systems , granular matter , sheared fluid , stochastic processes , and biological systems  @xcite .    in a pioneering study back in 1972  @xcite , g. s. agarwal obtained a modified fluctuation - dissipation relation ( mfdr ) that related response functions around non - equilibrium steady states ( ness ) to correlations evaluated at steady state . for a system evolving with a statistical dynamics characterized by the fokker - planck ( fp ) equation @xmath11 
 , agarwal showed that a perturbation in the operator @xmath12 leads to a response that can be expressed in terms of a correlation function evaluated at the unperturbed steady state  @xcite , r_a(t_2-t_1 ) = = a(t_2 ) m(t_1 ) where the _ agarwal term _ 
 @xmath13/p_s$ ] with @xmath14 denoting the steady - state probability distribution . throughout this paper by @xmath15 
 we denote a steady - state average . over the last decade 
 a formalism of stochastic thermodynamics has been developed that allows description of energy and entropy along fluctutating trajectories  @xcite . 
 various fluctuation theorems involving the distribution of entropy  @xcite , and work theorems  @xcite were discovered . 
 recently , using an integral fluctuation theorem , a number of these relations were derived in a unified manner  @xcite . 
 important experimental tests include colloidal particles manipulated by laser traps  @xcite , biomolecules pulled by afm or laser tweezer  @xcite and autonomous motion of motor proteins  @xcite . 
 stochastic thermodynamics has also been used to derive several versions of mfdr around ness  @xcite . 
 some of these predictions were experimentally verified  @xcite .    in this paper , we present a unified derivation of a number of mfdrs based entirely on the agarwal formalism  @xcite . thus the mfdrs we obtain are intrinsically equivalent to each other . 
 we show that the agarwal term @xmath16 can be expressed as a velocity excess from a local mean velocity using both the _ continuum _ langevin and _ discrete _ master equation dynamics . 
 this interpretation leads us to a modified einstein relation that has the same additive correction term for the two cases . 
 finally we apply this framework to a flashing ratchet model of molecular motors  @xcite to calculate the mfdr and the additive correction in einstein relation , which shows a non - monotonic variation with the asymmetry parameter of the ratchet . 
 the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec . 
 [ agarwal ] we review the derivation of the agarwal form of mfdr , that we use throughout this paper to calculate other versions of mfdr expressed in physically observable form . 
 using this result , in sec . 
 [ entropy - mfdr ] we present a simple and straightforward derivation of the mfdr in terms of stochastic entropy production , keeping in mind that this relation was used earlier to derive velocity - mfdr for a master equation dynamics  @xcite . 
 then , directly using the agarwal form , we derive the velocity - mfdr for a system evolving with continuum langevin dynamics in sec . 
 [ lange - mfdr ] , and a discrete master equation in sec . 
 [ master - mfdr ] . 
 the velocity - mfdr is used in sec . 
 [ einstein ] to derive a modified einstein relation at ness . in sec . 
 [ ratchet ] , we study the velocity - mfdr , and the violation of the einstein relation in a flashing ratchet model of molecular motors . finally in sec . 
 [ summary ] we summarise our main results and conclude . 
 the probability distribution @xmath17 of finding a system at state @xmath18 at time @xmath19 evolves with time as _ 
 t p(,t ) = ( , h ) p(,t ) [ eq1 ] where @xmath20 is a general time evolution operator that depends on external force @xmath2 . for weak @xmath9 , taylor expanding the operator we get ( , h ) = ( ) + h(t ) ( ) [ cl ] where @xmath21_{h=0}$ ] . 
 the solution to eq . 
 [ eq1 ] is p(,t ) = p_s + _ -^t de^(t- ) h ( ) p_s ( ) [ ps ] where @xmath14 denotes the steady - state distribution that obeys @xmath22 . 
 then the response of any observable @xmath23 to a force @xmath2 is r_a(t_2-t_1 ) & = & = a ( ) + & = & a ( ) e^(t_2-t_1 ) p_s ( ) + & = & a ( ) e^(t_2-t_1 ) m ( ) p_s ( ) + [ resp ] where in the last step we used the agarwal term @xmath24/p_s$ ] . by definition , 
 the two - time correlation function is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the joint probability distribution of finding the system at state @xmath27 at time @xmath28 and at state @xmath18 at time @xmath19 . 
 one can express @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the transition probability . 
 the time evolution @xmath11 can be solved to obtain the transition probability at steady state @xmath31 . 
 thus the two - time correlation at steady state takes the form @xmath32 . 
 therefore we can write eq . 
 [ resp ] as r_a(t_2-t_1 ) = a(t_2 ) m(t_1 ) . 
 this is the _ agarwal form _ of mfdr  @xcite . 
 the derivation presented here used a continuum notation of the phase space variable @xmath18 . 
 however , the result is general , and can be derived similarly for a system that evolves through transitions between discrete states ( see eq .  [ master - ag ] ) . 
 the agarwal term in its operator form @xmath24/p_s$ ] requires detailed knowledge of the probability distribution at steady state . in the rest of this paper we focus on expressing this term in physically observable form 
 the definition of non - equilibrium gibb s entropy @xmath33 has recently been used to get a definition of the stochastic entropy @xmath34  @xcite . for a master equation based discrete dynamics between states denoted by @xmath35 
 , the stochastic entropy can be written as @xmath36 . using this definition 
 we obtain a simple interpretation of the agarwal term in terms of stochastic entropy m & = & p_s = . 
 |_h=0 + & = & . 
 |_h=0 = - _ t [ _ h s]_h=0 . in deriving the above relation we assumed that @xmath37 is linear in @xmath9 . 
 we also used the fact that the steady state distribution @xmath38 . thus @xmath16 
 is expressed as time - evolution of a variable conjugate to the external force @xmath9 with respect to the stochastic system - entropy @xmath39 . in this sense , 
 @xmath39 in ness plays the role similar to the hamiltonian in equilibrium fdt . 
 we can now write the mfdr at ness as r_a(t_2-t_1)= a(t_2 ) [ -_h s(t_1 ) ] _ h=0 . 
 [ mfdr - s ] ref . 
 @xcite found this relation by considering a perturbation that takes the system to a final steady state . 
 note that our simple and straightforward derivation does not require such an assumption , and thus the result is more general . 
 the fdt at equilibrium can easily be derived from eq . 
 [ mfdr - s ] . 
 if , even in the presence of external perturbation the system remains at equilibrium , one can write down the probability distributions as @xmath40 $ ] where @xmath41 is the free energy . this distribution leads to the relation @xmath42_{h=0 } = \be [ ( \p_h f - \p_h h)p]_{h=0}$ ] . note that the equilibrium displacement evalutaed at @xmath43 is @xmath44_{h=0 } = 0 $ ] . 
 thus we get the identity @xmath45_{h=0 } = -[(\p_h p)/p]_{h=0 } = \be [ \p_h h]_{h=0}$ ] , which leads to the equilibrium fdt eq . 
 [ fdt - eq ] . 
 let us consider a langevin system where the dynamics of a particle evolves by v = f + [ lange ] where @xmath46 is the particle velocity , @xmath47 is the mobility , and @xmath48 denotes total force imparted on the particle . 
 the total force @xmath49 consists of a force due to interaction @xmath50 and an external time dependent force @xmath2 : @xmath51 . 
 the last term @xmath52 denotes a thermal noise that obeys @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 , the equilibrium einstein relation . 
 the corresponding fp equation is _ 
 t p(x , t ) & = & -_x j(x , t ) [ fp ] + with ,   j(x , t ) & = & ( f(x , t)-d_x ) p(x , t ) . 
 the velocity form of mfdr for a langevin system was originally derived in ref . 
 @xcite . here 
 we briefly outline the derivation starting from the agarwal form . 
 [ fp ] can be expressed as , _ 
 t p(x , t ) = ( + h(t ) ) p(x , t ) , where , @xmath56 and @xmath57 thus the agarwal term @xmath58 and @xmath59 . 
 the definition of the steady state current @xmath60 leads to the relation @xmath61 . defining a local mean velocity at steady state @xmath62 we can then rewrite @xmath63 . in this relation , using the langevin equation at initial steady state ( @xmath43 ) , we get @xmath64 . thus , the response function t r_a(t_2-t_1)= a(t_2 ) [ ( t_1 ) -v(t_1 ) + ( t_1 ) ] . 
 [ lend ] note that in the langevin equation @xmath65 and @xmath66 have the same status , and @xmath67 can be regarded as a functional of noise history . 
 then it can be shown that  @xcite , t r_a(t_2-t_1)= d = a(t_2 ) ( t_1 ) . 
 [ fdt - noise ] thus we can write eq . 
 [ lend ] as r_a(t_2-t_1)= a(t_2 ) [ lange - va ] this is the _ velocity form _ of mfdr , which for velocity - response gives r_v ( t_2-t_1)= v(t_2 ) [ v(t_1 ) - ( t_1 ) ] . 
 [ fdt - v2 ] note that the steady state average of @xmath68 is the same as the mean velocity : _ s = _ -l/2^l/2 dx p_s(x ) _ 
 s(x ) = f - d [ p_s]_-l/2^l/2 = v_s . 
 + [ nus_av ] the boundary term @xmath69_{-l/2}^{l/2 } = 0 $ ] either by a periodic boundary condition  @xcite , or by taking the boundaries to infinity where the probabilities vanish . 
 if the system is at equilibrium @xmath70 , and we get back the well - known equilibrium response , r^eq_v ( t_2-t_1)= v(t_2 ) v(t_1 ) _ eq 
 . therefore the non - equlibrium mfdr eq . 
 [ fdt - v2 ] can be viewed as the equilibrium fdt with an additive correction @xmath71 . 
 it is interesting to note that using eq . 
 [ fdt - noise ] , we can arrive at a non - equilibrium mfdr first obtained in ref . 
 @xcite for continuous langevin dynamics and subsequently shown to be true for discrete spin variables ( as well as , for conserved and non - conserved order parameter dynamics ) in ref . 
 @xcite . defining the position correlation function @xmath72 and the corresponding response function @xmath73 ( using eq . 
 [ fdt - noise ] ) , we get the modified mfdr ( _ t_1 - _ t_2 ) c_x(t_2,t_1 ) = 2tr_x(t_2,t_1 ) + a(t_2,t_1 ) where @xmath74 is the so - called asymmetry which vanishes in the presence of time reversal symmetry . note that causality demands that the response of the system at time @xmath75 to a perturbation at time @xmath7 , @xmath76 , is nonzero only when @xmath77 . 
 incorporating time translation invariace and time reversal symmetry restores the equilibrium fdt , @xmath78 . 
 also note that , the choice of the observable @xmath79 in ref . 
 @xcite as an 1d coordinate @xmath80 , reduces the second term on the r.h.s of eq . 13 in ref . 
 @xcite to @xmath81 . 
 now setting @xmath82 ( velocity ) , leads eq . 13 in ref 
 @xcite to eq . 
 [ lange - va ] in our manuscript , the velocity form of mfdr . 
 we now focus on a master equation system where the time - evolution occurs via transitions between discrete states . following ref . 
 @xcite , we first derive the discrete form of the agarwal term @xmath16 . 
 our main contribution in this section is to express @xmath16 as an excess velocity , and thus arrive at a _ velocity form _ of mfdr , similar to the langevin system . 
 we begin by considering a set of discrete states @xmath83 and write down the corresponding master equation for the probability @xmath84 of finding the system in a state @xmath85 at time @xmath19 : _ 
 t p_m(t ) & = & _ n [ w_nm p_n(t ) - w_mn p_m(t ) ] & & _ 
 n_mn p_n(t ) where , @xmath86 represents transition rate from state @xmath85 to @xmath87 and is generally dependent on the external force @xmath9 . the time evolution operator _ mn = w_nm - _ mn_kw_mk . 
 if the external force @xmath2 acting on the system is weak , taylor expanding about @xmath43 , we get _ 
 mn(h ) = ( ) _ mn + h(t)()_mn . in this relation ( ) _ mn = w_nm_nm - _ mn_kw_mk_mk where @xmath88_{h=0}$ ] gives the relative change of rates . 
 note that the system is prepared in a ness at @xmath89 characterized by the stationary distribution @xmath90 . 
 .  [ resp ] can be expressed in the discrete notation as r_a(t_2 - t_1 ) & = & _ m , n a_m [ e^(t_2 - t_1 ) p(t_1)]_mn m_n + & = & a(t_2)m(t_1)[master - ag ] where the agarwal term is m_m & = & _ n()_mn ( p_n)_s & = & _ n w_nm_nm - _ nw_mn_mn . 
 [ master - m ]    now we use the above relation to derive the velocity form of mfdr . 
 we assume a displacement @xmath91 associated with each transition from state @xmath85 to @xmath87 . 
 this has the property @xmath92 and gives a definition of velocity @xmath93  @xcite . 
 a generalized detailed balance in presence of the external force @xmath9 = [ loc_eq ] leads to the following useful relation _ mn - _ nm = d_mn . 
 we also utilize the probability current j_mn = p_m w_mn - p_n w_nm = -j_nm . then from eq . 
 [ master - m ] we find the velocity form of agwarwal term , m_m & = & _ nw_nm _ nm - _ nw_mn _ mn + & = & _ nw_nm ( _ mn + d_nm ) - _ nw_mn _ mn + & = & _ nw_nmd_nm - _ n ( j_mn)_s _ mn + & = & ( v_m - _ m ) , [ m_vel ]    where v_m = _ 
 n w_nmd_nm , + _ m = _ n _ mn . [ vm - num ] these relations lead to the _ velocity form _ of mfdr r_a(t_2-t_1 ) & = & _ m , n a_m [ e^(t_2 - t_1 ) p(t_1)]_mn [ ( v_m - _ m ) ] + & = & a(t_2 ) [ v(t_1 ) - ( t_1 ) ] . 
 [ master - va ] note that eq . 
 [ master - va ] agrees with the results obtained in ref.s  @xcite . 
 in particular , ref . 
 @xcite used the mfdr expressed in terms of stochastic entropy of the system @xmath39 ( eq .  [ mfdr - s ] ) to obtain eq . 
 [ master - va ] . 
 they used the total stochastic entropy @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the stochastic entropy of the medium and showed _ h _ 
 m(t ) & = & _ m ( t - _ m ) d_m-1,m v(t ) = _ m _ 
 n(t),m v_m + _ h _ 
 tot(t ) & = & ( t ) = _ m _ n(t),m _ m where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are given by eq . 
 [ vm - num ] . 
 note the equivalence of eq . 
 [ master - va ] with eq . 
 [ lange - va ] . 
 indeed the analogy of @xmath68 described here with the local mean velocity @xmath98 $ ] in the langevin system becomes even more clear when we compare the steady state average @xmath99 with @xmath100 and find _ 
 s = t_mn j_mn _ mn = _ mn ( p_n)_s w_nm d_nm= v_s . 
 this relation is the same as eq . 
 [ nus_av ] obtained for the langevin system .    for a velocity - response eq . 
 [ master - va ] readily leads us to eq . 
 [ fdt - v2 ] already obtained in the context of langevin dynamics . 
 this completes one of the main achievements of this paper     the agarwal formalism leads to the same form of velocity - mfdr for discrete master equation and continuum langevin dynamics . 
 using the velocity mfdr ( eq . 
 [ fdt - v2 ] ) we find the mobility in ness _ s = _ 0^dr_v ( ) = _ 0^dv ( ) [ v(0 ) - ( 0 ) ] . on the other hand , the diffusion constant in an ness having mean velocity @xmath101 is d_s = _ 0^d . thus the mobility @xmath102 and diffusion constant @xmath103 at ness 
 do not satisfy the equilibrium einstein relation , i.e. , @xmath104 . 
 the difference gives us the modification in the einstein relation in terms of the _ violation integral _ 
 i d_s - t _ s = _ 0^d . 
 [ iv ] since the form of velocity - mfdr for langevin equation ( eq .  [ lange - va ] ) and master equation ( eq .  [ master - va ] ) are the same , we get the same modified einstein relation for both the cases . 
 in this section we apply the concepts developed so far in this paper on a specific realization of the flashing ratchet model of molecular motors  @xcite . in particular 
 , we calculate the velocity - mfdr for this model and derive the violation integral of the corresponding non - equilibrium einstein relation .

 thus a simple two - state approximation of the dynamics of motor - proteins was proposed  @xcite where the motor encounters a locally asymmetric but globally periodic potential , whose height switches between a large and a small value . 
 we consider a flashing - ratchet model where the system swithces between two states , ( 1 )  on - state : stochastic motion in an asymmetric piece - wise linear potential , ( 2 )  off - state : simple one dimensional diffusion ( fig .  [ model ] ) . 
 the probability distributions in the two states @xmath108 evolve by  @xcite _ t p_1 + _ x j_1 & = & _ 2 p_2 - _ 1 p_1 _ t p_2 + _ x j_2 & = & -_2 p_2 + _ 1 p_1 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 $ ] , and @xmath107 denote the transition rates . in the on - state , the potential @xmath111 is periodic @xmath112 with period @xmath113 . within one period ,

 the parameter - values used to obtain these curves are @xmath120 nm , @xmath121 , @xmath122m@xmath123s@xmath124 , @xmath125pn  nm , @xmath126 and simulation time - step @xmath127s . 
 the transition rates are chosen to be equal with @xmath128s@xmath124 . with these parameter values 
 we find @xmath129m@xmath123s@xmath124 , @xmath130m@xmath123s@xmath124 , and the violation integral @xmath131m@xmath123s@xmath124 . 
 the mean velocity in steady state is @xmath132 m/s . 
 , width=302 ]    we perform molecular dynamics simulations of a particle moving under the influence of the above - mentioned ratchet potential in the presence of a langevin heat bath . 
 we use stochastic switching between the on and off states with a constant switching rate @xmath133 . from this simulation , in fig . 
 [ corr ] , we plot the velocity - response function @xmath134 and the related steady - state correlations @xmath119 , @xmath135 ( eq . [ fdt - v2 ] ) . 
 the parameter values we use are enlisted in fig . 
 [ corr ] and are typical of microtubule associated molecular motors  @xcite . at long time , both @xmath119 and @xmath135 decorrelates to @xmath136 . 
 we utilize the correlation functions to determine the mobility @xmath102 , diffusion constant @xmath103 , and the violation integral @xmath137 ( see fig . 
 [ corr ] ) . 
 we calculate the dependence of the steady - state mobility @xmath138 , diffusion constant @xmath103 and the violation integral @xmath139 on the asymmetry parameter @xmath140 ( fig .  [ alpha_i ] ) where @xmath141 denotes the symmetric ratchet . 
 this calculation leads us to the curious result that all the three quantities have minimum at @xmath141 . 
 the steady - state diffusion constant @xmath103 in the flashing - ratchet is always suppressed ( @xmath142 ) , and moves closer to the free diffusion @xmath143 for the most asymmetric ratchet . 
 note that the violation integral quantifies the difference between ness and equilibrium , with equilibrium requiring @xmath144 . 
 the symmetric ratchet does not generate unidirectional motion , but the switching between the on and off states keeps the system out of equilibrium . 
 thus , though the violation integral reaches its minimum at @xmath141 it remains @xmath145 . 
 setting switching rates @xmath146 would restore equilibrium with @xmath147 . 
 the dependence of @xmath139 on various models and parameter values at different ness is yet to be fully understood . 
 , mobility @xmath148 and violation integral @xmath139 as a function of asymmetry parameter @xmath140 . 
 all the other parameter values are same as in fig  [ corr ] . 
 , width=302 ]    while calculation of all the other quantities from our simulations are straight - forward , @xmath149 demands a special mention . 
 the local mean velocity @xmath150 is the stochastic particle velocity @xmath151 averaged over the subset of trajectories passing through @xmath80 . at steady state 
 , this definition is the same as @xmath62 where the mean current is constant everywhere : @xmath152 with @xmath101 the mean velocity at steady state and @xmath153 the mean density . in calculating @xmath135 , the local mean velocity at time @xmath19 
 is obtained by identifying the value of @xmath150 corresponding to the position @xmath80 visited by the particle at that instant . 
 we have presented a unified derivation of modified fluctuation dissipation relations ( mfdr ) at non - equilibrium steady states ( ness ) using the agarwal formalism . 
 thus all the various versions of mfdr that we derived in this paper are intrinsically equivalent to each other . 
 we showed that the response function around any ness can be expressed as a correlation between the observable and a variable conjugate to the external force with respect to the system s stochastic entropy production . for both a continuum langevin and a discrete master equation system , 
 we have shown that the non - equilibrium form of fdt involving velocity response can be expressed as an equilibrium one and an additive correction . 
 the correction in both these cases is a correlation function of the velocity with a local mean velocity . 
 the resulting modification of the einstein s relation gives the violation in terms of a time integral over this additive correction . 
 using molecular dynamics simulations in presence of langevin heat - bath , we studied a flashing ratchet model within this framework and obtained the response function and velocity correlations in the steady state . 
 we showed that the violation integral varies non - monotonically with the asymmetry parameter of the ratchet and reaches a non - zero minimum for the case of a symmetric ratchet . 
 we plan to extend our study to other models of molecular motors  @xcite , stochastic particle - pumps  @xcite , polymer translocation dynamics  @xcite , and dynamics of self - propelled particles  @xcite .

55,"given a discrete distribution @xmath0 on @xmath1 classes @xmath2 , we consider an index called _ polarization measure _ , defined by @xmath3    the polarization measure has been introduced in economics for real distributions by . 
 the discrete version we consider here has been used in . 
 the polarization measure has the following interpretation .

 @xmath5 and consider the indicator of _ exactly two equal _ 
 @xmath6 then @xmath7 } =   3 \sum_{x=0}^n \pi_x^2(1-\pi_x ) = 3 { \operatorname{pol}\left(\pi\right)}$ ] . 
 [ fig : polarization ]    the polarization measure on the classes @xmath8 , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : polarization ] , has an unstable critical point at the uniform distribution , it is zero in the case of concentration in one class , and reaches its maximum 1/4 on distributions on two classes with equal probabilities . 
 polarization measure was devised to be an index of the distance of a distribution from the three cases of maximal polarization . in fig . 
 [ fig : polarization ] the simplex is represented as an equilateral triangle . in the following 
 we shall use different sets of coordinates to represent the probability simplex , e.g. see fig . 
 [ fig : gradpol - a ] ( left ) . 
 we want to study the dynamics of this index , i.e. to characterise evolutions that maximise or minimise the index . 
 this study requires tools from information geometry ( ig ) e.g. , . 
 however , the following presentation is actually largely self - contained . 
 the recourse to ig is not dispensable because the ordinary gradient flow of @xmath9 , as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : gradpol - b ] ( left ) , does not lead to the extrema of interest on the border of the probability simplex . 
 consequently , one wants to turn to a different way to compute the gradient , i.e. to the so - called amari s natural gradient . 
 we use elementary fact of the theory of dynamical systems to characterise critical points of the gradient flow and refer to . 
 the basics of ig are discussed in sec . 
 [ sec : natural gradient ] . 
 the application of ig to the polarization measure is described in sec . 
 [ sec : pol ] . 
 the possibility of a generalisation of such an index is shortly discussed in sec . 
 [ sec : pols ] , while the reduction of the problem to the study of an exponential family is presented in sec . 
 [ sec : polase ] . 
 we suggest a possible application in sec . [ 
 sec : app ] . 
 further material , not directly related with the measure of polarization , but suggested by the methodology , is presented in the appendixes . 
 differential equations on the probability simplex are well known in applications other then descriptive statistics . 
 we briefly discuss the relations between these applications and our one in app . 
 [ sec : replicator ] . in app . 
 [ sec : hessian ] some issues related to the second order calculus are briefly discussed . 
 we denote by @xmath10 the simplex of the probability function @xmath0 on @xmath11 . 
 the interior of the simplex , @xmath12 , is the set of the strictly positive probability functions , @xmath13    the border of the simplex is the union of all the faces of @xmath10 as a convex set . 
 we recall that a face of maximal dimension @xmath14 is called facet . 
 a facet is a simplex of dimension @xmath14 . 
 we define @xmath15 to be the vector space of random variables @xmath16 that are @xmath0-centered , @xmath17 } = 0 $ ] . in the geometry of @xmath18 , @xmath15 is the plane through the origin , orthogonal to the vector @xmath19 .    1 . 
 the _ tangent bundle _ of the open simplex @xmath20 is the set @xmath21 2 .   if @xmath22 is a one - dimensional statistical model , geometrically a curve , its _ score _ 
 @xmath23 belongs to @xmath24 for all @xmath25 . as the score is a centered random variable , 
 hence @xmath26 is a curve in the tangent bundle . 
 in fact , @xmath27 is meant to represent a generic velocity vector through @xmath0 , see fig . 
 [ fig : tangentbundle ] . 
 the score is a representation of the velocity along a curve , because of a geometric interpretation of c. r. rao s classical computation : @xmath28= \frac d { dt } \sum_x u(x)p(x;t)= \sum_x u(x )   \frac d { dt } p(x;t)=\\ 
 \sum_x u(x )   \frac 
 d { dt } \log\left ( p(x;t)\right)p(x;t)= \sum_x \left(u(x)-e_t[u]\right )   \frac d { dt } \log\left ( p(x;t)\right)p(x;t)=\\ e_t\left[\left(u - e_t[u]\right ) \frac d { dt } \log\left ( p(t)\right ) \right]=   { \left\langleu - e_t[u],d p(t)\right\rangle_{p(t)}}\end{gathered}\ ] ] we observe that the scalar product above is the scalar product on @xmath24 . 
 a curve on the simplex is a parametric model . 
 the probability @xmath0 is represented by a vector from @xmath29 to the point whose coordinates are @xmath30 . in fig . 
 [ fig : tangentbundle ] , the velocity vectors are represented by arrows ; they are orthogonal to the vectors @xmath19 . 
 [ fig : tangentbundle ]    in our context , a _ vector field _ 
 @xmath31 is a mapping such that @xmath32 , i.e. such that the couple @xmath33 belongs to the tangent bundle . 
 @xmath34 for all @xmath0 . 
 because of our geometrical construction , here we prefer to call @xmath35 a vector field , but we want to stress its statistical meaning of centered function of the distribution . 
 a _ differential equation _ is an equation of the form @xmath36 . 
 given a real function @xmath37 , its _ gradient _ is the vector field @xmath38 such that for all curves @xmath39 we have @xmath40 } , u , v \in b_\pi.\ ] ]    the rao s computation in eq . is the prototypical gradient computation . 
 the _ gradient flow equation _ is the differential equation @xmath41    along a solution of the gradient flow equation the value of @xmath42 is increasing because @xmath43 . actually the solution of the gradient flow equation is the curve of _ 
 steepest ascent_.    computations are usually performed in a _ 
 @xmath44 @xmath45 being an open set in @xmath46 . 
 the @xmath47-th coordinate curve is obtained by fixing the other @xmath14 components and moving @xmath48 only . 
 the scores of the @xmath47-th coordinate curves are the random variables @xmath49    the sequence @xmath50 is a vector basis of the tangent space @xmath51 . 
 the representation of the scalar product in such a basis is @xmath52 where the matrix @xmath53_{i , i=1}^n$ ] is the _ fisher information _ matrix . 
 if @xmath54 is the expression in the parameters of a function @xmath55 , that is @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the expression in the parameters of a generic curve @xmath58 , then the components of the gradient in are expressed in terms of the ordinary gradient by observing that @xmath59    as @xmath60 , we obtain from @xmath61    the _ natural gradient _ is a vector @xmath62 whose components are the coordinates of the gradient @xmath63 in its @xmath0-basis , that is @xmath64    by substitution of the expression in we obtain @xmath65    fig . 
 [ fig : albero ] is an illustration for the function @xmath66 . 
 the _ common parametrization _ of the ( flat ) simplex @xmath67 is the projection on the solid simplex @xmath68 , that is @xmath69 in which case @xmath70 , @xmath71 , is the random variable with values @xmath72 at @xmath73 , 1 at @xmath74 , 0 otherwise , hence @xmath75 and @xmath76    the element @xmath77 of the fisher information matrix is @xmath78 } = \\ 
 \sum_x \pi(x,\bm\eta)^{-1}\left((x = j)(j = h)+(x = 0)\right ) = \eta_j^{-1}(j = h ) + \left(1 - \sum_k \eta_k\right)^{-1}\end{gathered}\ ] ] hence @xmath79_{i , j=1}^n.\ ] ]    as an example we consider @xmath80 . the fisher information matrix , 
 its inverse and the determinant of the inverse are , respectively , @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 note that the computation of the inverse of @xmath84 is an application of the sherman - morrison formula and the computation of the determinant of @xmath85 is an application of the matrix determinant lemma .    for general @xmath86 
 , we have the following proposition , whose interest stems from the definition of natural gradient , see eq . . 
 [ prop : i-1 ]    1 . 
 the inverse of the fisher information matrix is @xmath87 2 .   in particular 
 , @xmath85 is zero on the vertexes of the simplex , only . 
 the determinant of the fisher information matrix is @xmath88 4 . 
 the determinant of @xmath85 is zero on the borders of the simplex , only . 
 5 .   on the interior of each facet , 
 the rank of @xmath85 is @xmath14 and the @xmath14 liner independent column vectors generate the subspace parallel to the facet itself .    1 .   by direct computation , @xmath89 is the identity matrix . 
 2 .   the diagonal elements of @xmath85 are zero if @xmath90 or @xmath91 , for @xmath71 . if , for a given @xmath47 , @xmath90 , then the elements of @xmath85 are zero if @xmath92 , @xmath93 . 
 the remaining case corresponds to @xmath91 for all @xmath47 . 
 then @xmath94 on all the vertexes of the simplex . 
 3 .   it follows from matrix determinant lemma . 
 the determinant factors in terms corresponding to the equations of the facets . 
 5 .   given @xmath95 , the conditions @xmath96 and @xmath97 for all @xmath98 , 
 define the interior of the facet orthogonal to standard base vector @xmath99 . in this case the @xmath95-th row and the @xmath95-th column of @xmath100 are zero and the complement matrix corresponds to the inverse of a fisher information matrix in dimension @xmath14 with non zero determinant . 
 it follows that the subspace generated by the columns has dimension @xmath14 and coincides with the space orthogonal to @xmath101 . 
 consider the facet defined by @xmath102 , @xmath103 for all @xmath95 . 
 for a given @xmath47 , the matrix without the @xmath47-th row and the @xmath47-th column has determinant @xmath104 . on the considered facet 
 this determinant is different to zero and @xmath85 has rank @xmath14 and their columns are orthogonal to the constant vector . 
 an other parametrization is the _ exponential parametrization _ 
 based on the exponential family with sufficient statistics @xmath105 , @xmath71 , @xmath106 where @xmath107 some of the properties discussed in prop . 
 [ prop : i-1 ] should actually be discussed under the exponential parametrization , see e.g. , but we do not do that here . 
 we will discuss the exponential parametrization below in sec . 
 [ sec : polase ] to show that polarization can be seen as an expectation with respect to an exponential family . 
 we apply now the general theory of the natural gradient to the study of the dynamics of the polarization measure . 
 our goal is to find the lines of the steepest ascent of the function @xmath9 .    in the common parametrization 
 we have @xmath108 and , for @xmath109 , @xmath110 with gradient @xmath111 the inverse of the fisher information matrix is @xmath112 the natural gradient is @xmath113 see in fig.s [ fig : gradpol - a ] and [ fig : gradpol - b ] the gradient fields .    [ cols=""^,^ "" , ]     to study the flow in the fixed points we consider the sign of the eigenvalues of the jacobian of the natural gradient , calculated in the fixed points , see @xcite .    the jacobian of @xmath114 is @xmath115 $ ] where @xmath116 @xmath117    the jacobian calculated in the vertexes are @xmath118 and the two eigenvalues of the three jacobian are both positive . 
 then , the fixed points on the vertexes repel flow locally . 
 moreover , the natural gradient is zero on the midpoints of the borders , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 . 
 the jacobian calculated in the midpoints are @xmath122 and the two eigenvalues of the three jacobian are both negative . 
 then , these fixed points attract flow locally .    in standard cases 
 the jacobian of a gradient is the hessian matrix . 
 this is not true anymore in ig where we compute the jacobian of the natural gradient . 
 actually , in ig there are various notions of hessian , each one based on a different connection on the tangent bundle . 
 we consider now an inverse problem in the simple case @xmath109 . 
 we want a third degree symmetric polynomial which could be used as polarization measure . 
 computations were performed using sage @xcite . 
 a generic polynomial is @xmath123 and its expression in the parameters is @xmath124    the components of the natural gradient are @xmath125 note that the case @xmath126 is @xmath127 and @xmath128 . because of the multiplication by @xmath129 , the natural gradient @xmath130 is zero in each of the simplex vertexes @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 . 
 because of the symmetry , the natural gradient @xmath130 is zero in each of the mid - point of the edges , i.e. @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and at the uniform probability , @xmath137 . 
 we need to turn to the discussion of the jacobian matrix of the natural gradient of @xmath138 .    at the vertexes , 
 the jacobian is @xmath139 so that we want @xmath140 .    at the uniform probability @xmath137 
 the jacobian is @xmath141 a _ necessary _ condition of non definiteness is @xmath142    at the mid - points of the three edges @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , the values of the jacobian matrices are , respectively , @xmath143 and , imposing the necessary condition @xmath144 of eq . 
 , they are @xmath145 the two eigenvalues of each of these matrices are both negative if @xmath146 . 
 notice that this condition of attracting flow on the midpoints is the same condition of repelling flow on the vertexes . 
 summarising , the conditions on the coefficients of a third degree symmetric polynomial that represent a measure with the properties stated above , are @xmath147    in conclusion , it is possible to design other measures of polarization in the form of a symmetric polynomial of degree 3 , or more general forms . in particular 
 , it would be interesting to have a measure in a form similar to the entropy . 
 the analogy is suggested by the fact that the gradient flow of the entropy gives trajectories that move from the uniform probability to one of the vertexes of the simplex . 
 we have already observed that the function @xmath9 defined in eq . 
 [ eq : pol ] is an homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 in the indeterminates @xmath148 . the general class of indexes based on homogeneous polynomials that we have discussed in sec . 
 [ sec : pols ] is of special interest because they reduce to an expectation with respect to an exponential family , as we discuss now in the case of three sample points .    if the random variables @xmath4 are i.i.d . with the distribution of @xmath149 supported by @xmath8 , and coded as an exponential family 
 i.e. @xmath150 then the joint probability function of @xmath4 is itself an exponential family , @xmath151 with sufficient statistics @xmath152 , @xmath153 . 
 the model for @xmath154 is @xmath155 where @xmath138 is the table count of @xmath154 . 
 the random variables of this model are represented in tab . 
 [ tab:1 ] . 
 @xmath156    the marginal polytope , that is the convex set generated by the values of the sufficient statistics , is illustrated in fig . 
 [ fig : mpolytope ] . 
 we refer to @xcite for the relevant theory . 
 m.65m.30 & @xmath157    if @xmath158 is the indicator function of the set @xmath159 then the value of @xmath160 , when expressed in the parameters @xmath161 , is @xmath162}$ ] . 
 thus , the problem of the maximisation of the polarization measure is rephrased to the problem of finding the maximum of the expected value of a random variable on a given exponential family . 
 this approach has been considered in combinatorial optimisation , see e.g. . 
 it has a number of issues . 
 first , any convergent evolution along the exponential family has either a limit internal to the exponential family itself of a limit outside the exponential family , supported by a face of the marginal polytope , see . 
 second , the maximum of the function can be reached as a limit of expected values if , and only if , there exists , among the distributions obtained conditioning the exponential family to one face of the marginal polytope , a distribution such that the expected value of the function is equal to the maximum of the function itself . 
 we do not enter here in a detailed discussion , see more information in . 
 the expectation parameters of the exponential family are @xmath163 } & = 3 \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_1 } \psi(\theta_1,\theta_2 ) = 3 \frac { { \mathrm{e}}^{\theta_1}}{1 + { \mathrm{e}}^{\theta_1 } + { \mathrm{e}}^{\theta_2 } } , \\    { { \mathbb e}_{\bm \theta}\left[t_2\right]}&= 3 \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_2 } \psi(\theta_1,\theta_2 ) = 3 \frac { { \mathrm{e}}^{\theta_2}}{1 + { \mathrm{e}}^{\theta_1 } + { \mathrm{e}}^{\theta_2}}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] these parameters are related to the @xmath164 by @xmath165 } = { { \mathbb e}_{\bm\theta}\left[x_j\right ] } + { { \mathbb e}_{\bm\theta}\left[y_j\right ] } + { { \mathbb e}_{\bm\theta}\left[z_j\right ] } = 3\eta_j , \quad j = 1,2.\ ] ]    the inverse of the map @xmath166 can be computed explicitly as @xmath167    the cumulant function is expressed as a function of @xmath164 as @xmath168 and the exponential family in eq . 
 is expressed in the parameter @xmath169 as @xmath170    when the probabilities are expressed in the form of eq . 
 , we can actually compute values for border cases @xcite . 
 we recover in a different way the result already known . 
 @xmath171 : : :    eq . becomes    @xmath172 ,    which is zero but for @xmath173 . 
 this distribution is    concentrated on    @xmath174 , with    @xmath175 . 
 it follows    @xmath176 } = 3/4 $ ] . 
 @xmath177 : : :    same as the previous case . 
 the distribution is concentrated where    @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and    @xmath180 } = 3/4 $ ] . 
 @xmath181 : : :    in this case the distribution is    @xmath182 with    support on the face where @xmath183 , probabilities    @xmath184 , and    @xmath185 } = 3/4 $ ] . 
 we have shown on an example that the maximal value of the polarization measure is actually reachable as a limit of the expected value of a random variable @xmath186 on the exponential family , but this does not mean that the maximum value of the expected value is equal to the maximum value of the random variable itself . 
 this would be true if the maximum of the random variable were reached on a face of the marginal polytope . 
 this is discussed in the literature we have cited above . 
 we have considered a statistical index different from indexes for concentration or uniformity , such as the discrete gini index or boltzmann - gibbs - shannon entropy . 
 the polarization measure has been discussed in a dynamic way , by considering its variation and computing the directions of steepest variation . 
 the study requires tools suitable to discuss differential equation on a differentiable manifold . 
 this methodology suggests to implement the velocity of variation itself as a statistical index . consider a study of the evolution of an index in time such as . in the time series @xmath187 
 the evolution of the index e.g. , @xmath188 , could be misleading , because an increase in the index could be associated to a shift from a basin of attraction to a different basin of attraction . 
 we suggest a more precise local study as follows . given a movement from @xmath189 to @xmath190 , we look for a comparison of an estimate @xmath191 of the velocity vector to the gradient field of the index , that is compute @xmath192 . 
 an estimator of the velocity is a mapping from a couple of densities @xmath193 , @xmath194 to the tangent space at the initial density @xmath195 . 
 the inverse of such a mapping is discussed under the name of _ retraction _ in . 
 the simplest example here being @xmath196 , which is suggested by @xmath197 it is a common practice in engineering to use the initial velocity of the riemannian geodesic connecting @xmath189 to @xmath190 . 
 this would require the computation of the geodesic itself , which is done using the computations schetched in app .

56,"recently there has been a considerable interest in trying to obtain atomic decompositions of the space @xmath6 . 
 these decompositions are usually obtained in terms of frames generated by a family of functions translated on a regular grid , and dilated by powers of a dilation matrix . 
 the uniformity of the grid and the structure of the dilations can be exploited to obtain very sharp results . for irregular grids and unstructured dilations or 
 if dilations are replaced by other transformations the situation is more complex and requires different techniques . 
 one method is to use the regular case and try to obtain perturbations of the grid that preserve the frame structure . 
 another possibility is to obtain irregular samples of the continuous transform , that have the required properties .    in this article 
 we study frame decompositions of the space @xmath4 using translations of a family of functions on irregular grids , and arbitrary dilations , and we even replace dilations by other transformations . 
 our approach is different and very general , allowing quite general constructions . 
 we prove the existence of smooth time - frequency frame atoms in several variables . 
 the setting includes as particular cases , wavelet frames on irregular lattices and with a set of dilations or transformations that do not have a group structure . 
 another particular case are non - harmonic gabor frames with non - uniform covering of the euclidean space . 
 it also leads to new constructions of wavelet and gabor frames with regular lattice translates . 
 one of the nice features of the proposed method is that it unifies different atomic decompositions . 
 for the case of regular lattices guido weiss and his group @xcite developed a very fundamental program to characterize a large class of decompositions of @xmath4 through certain equations that the generators must satisfy . 
 this is an important attempt to unify gabor and wavelets decompositions . 
 other fundamental construction of mra wavelet frames on regular lattices can also be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . 
 our methods can be used to produce a substantial part of these systems . 
 a set @xmath7 is a wavelet set if the inverse fourier transform of the characteristic function of the set is a wavelet . 
 wavelet sets , frame wavelet sets and methods for constructing such sets have been studied recently @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite . 
 our methods give constructions of wavelet sets with translations on irregular grids . 
 let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be countable index sets . 
 we consider families of functions @xmath10 and discrete sets @xmath11 such that the collection @xmath12 form a frame for @xmath4 . 
 the wavelet case is obtained when @xmath13 with a an expansive matrix and @xmath14 a fixed atom . 
 we want to stress here that our constructions are much more general , allowing for example a different invertible ( not necessarily expansive ) matrix @xmath15 for each @xmath16 for the case of orthogonal wavelets , yang wang @xcite has recently considered wavelet sets associated with arbitrary families of invertible matrices and irregular sets of translates . 
 he gave conditions for the existence of such wavelet sets and related them to spectral pairs . 
 irregular wavelet and gabor frames also have been studied as perturbations of uniform ( lattice translate ) frames and also as sampling of the continuous wavelet/ gabor transform . 
 see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . 
 the approach in this article can be considered in the spirit of the classic construction in 1 dimension of smooth regular tight frames done by daubechies , grossmann and meyer in @xcite . 
 they found , for the case of uniform lattices , general conditions on a compactly supported smooth function @xmath17 , in order that it generates a tight gabor frame of @xmath18 . in the affine case they found necessary and sufficient conditions for a band limited function in order that it generates a smooth wavelet frame . 
 see also @xcite . 
 there were other related attempts to obtain atomic decompositions of functional spaces using very general systems . 
 see for example @xcite , @xcite in the context of locally compact groups . 
 this paper is organized as follows : section [ notation ] introduces the notation and some preliminaries . 
 section [ wc ] presents a theorem on wavelet construction on arbitrary , sufficiently dense , but otherwise irregular grids and with arbitrary dilation or even invertible transformation matrices . 
 specific constructions of such wavelets are obtained in section [ ew ] , first in the 1-d case and then in the multidimensional case . 
 a general theory of frame atomic decomposition of @xmath4 is obtained in section [ gen - res ] . using the concept of outer frame , reconstruction formulas for these atomic decompositions 
 are obtained in section [ rf ] . 
 throughout the paper @xmath8 and @xmath9 will denote countable index sets , and @xmath19 will stand for the function @xmath20 we will use @xmath21 to denote the lebesgue measure of a measurable set @xmath22 .    a set @xmath23 of measurable functions on @xmath24 is called a _ riesz partition of unity _ ( * rpu * ) , if there exist constants @xmath25 such that @xmath26    let @xmath27 be a family of measurable subsets of @xmath5 . 
 a _ riesz partition of unity * associated to @xmath28 * _ , is a set @xmath23 of measurable functions , such that    1 . 
 @xmath29 2 . 
 there exist constants @xmath25 such that @xmath30    * if @xmath31 is a rpu , then @xmath32 is also a rpu . * 
 if @xmath33 , we will say that @xmath31 is a _ regular partition of unity_. * if the sets in @xmath28 are essentially disjoint ( i.e. @xmath34 ) , the family @xmath35 will yield a regular partition of unity associated to @xmath28 . 
 * every rpu @xmath31 can be normalized to obtain a regular partition of unity by considering @xmath36 * given a family @xmath37 of measurable sets on @xmath5 , define @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the cardinal of the set @xmath40 . 
 the value @xmath41 is called the _ covering index _ of @xmath28 . 
 we now recall the definition of frame for a given close subspace @xmath42 of @xmath4 . 
 a set of functions @xmath43 is a _ frame _ for @xmath42 if @xmath44 and there exist constants @xmath45 , such that @xmath46    for a measurable set @xmath47 we will denote by @xmath48 the functions that have support in @xmath49 , and by @xmath50 the functions whose fourier transform has support in @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath51    we will need also the following definition . 
 let @xmath52 be a hilbert space . 
 a collection of vectors @xmath53 is an _ 
 outer frame _ for a closed subspace @xmath42 of @xmath52 , if @xmath54 is a frame for @xmath42 , where @xmath55 is the orthogonal projection onto @xmath42 , or equivalently , there exist constants @xmath45 , such that @xmath56    related definitions to the concept of outer frames appear in @xcite , @xcite .    throughout the paper , 
 we will use the following immediate and very useful fact about frames : + if @xmath57 is a frame for @xmath48 , and @xmath58 , then @xmath57 is an outer frame for @xmath59 . 
 our first results concerns the construction of wavelets @xmath60 with translates on the arbitrary irregular grid @xmath61 and with an arbitrary countable family of invertible @xmath2 matrices @xmath3 .    [ wavelets ] [ wavelet ] let @xmath62 be a set of finite measure , @xmath17 a function in @xmath4 and @xmath63 a family of invertible matrices .    for each @xmath64 set @xmath65 and let @xmath66 . 
 assume that @xmath28 is a covering of @xmath5 , @xmath67 is a rpu with bounds @xmath68 and @xmath69 and that @xmath70 . 
 consider @xmath71 such that for each @xmath64 , the set @xmath72 forms a frame for @xmath73 with lower and upper frame bounds @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively . if @xmath76 and @xmath77 , then the collection @xmath78 is a wavelet frame of @xmath4 with bounds @xmath79 and @xmath80 , generated by a single function @xmath81 , where @xmath81 is the inverse fourier transform of @xmath17 . 
 since for each @xmath64 we have that @xmath82 forms a frame for @xmath73 with lower and upper frame bounds @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively , an application of part  [ coro-2 ] of corollary [ transl ] for the matrix @xmath83 shows that @xmath84 forms a frame of @xmath85 with the same bounds . from the definition of @xmath86 , @xmath87 is then a frame for @xmath85 with frame bounds @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    on the other side , if @xmath90 then @xmath67 is associated to @xmath91 . 
 so , we can apply proposition [ genexpdil ] to @xmath92 and @xmath93 , to conclude that , @xmath94 forms a frame of @xmath4 with lower frame bound @xmath95 and upper frame bound @xmath96 . 
 this gives that , @xmath97 forms a frame of @xmath4 with frame bounds @xmath79 ( or @xmath98 ) and @xmath80 . 
 the theorem now follows from an application of the inverse fourier transform .    1 . 
 the set of matrices @xmath99 can be arbitrary and need not have a group structure . 
 the set @xmath100 can also be chosen to have a simple structure . 
 for example , @xmath101 , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a rotation and @xmath104 a dilation matrix , will be used to construct directional wavelets . 
 an even simpler example is @xmath105 , @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is an invertible matrix which gives a construction of wavelet frames on @xmath5 . 
 3 .   note that @xmath17 does not need to be compactly supported . 
 we will use the theorem above to construct specific examples of wavelets , e.g. , directional wavelets , isotropic wavelets , etc . 
 * interesting particular cases of theorem  [ wavelet ] . 
 *    1 .   @xmath108 . 
 + let @xmath109 be such that @xmath110 is a frame for @xmath73 with frame bounds @xmath111 and @xmath112 
 . then @xmath113 forms a wavelet frame of @xmath4 with bounds @xmath79 and @xmath80 . 
 2 .   @xmath114 , with @xmath115 . 
 + each of the following sets are wavelet frames of @xmath4 with bounds @xmath79 and @xmath80 : @xmath116    1 . 
 if the set @xmath28 is a tiling of @xmath5 then the wavelets constructed above are shannon - like wavelets , thus not well localized in space . to obtain well localized space - frequency wavelets , 
 @xmath117 must be constructed to be a smooth partition of unity , e.g. , at least @xmath118 as demonstrated in the examples in section [ ew ] , below 
 reconstruction formulas for such wavelet frames are developed in section [ rf ] . 
 to be able to use theorem [ wavelet ] to construct concrete examples of wavelet frames on irregular grids , we first need to construct exponential frames @xmath119 ( also called fourier frames ) for @xmath120 . 
 exponential frames play a central role in sampling theory for paley - wiener spaces ( also known as spaces of band - limited functions ) . 
 the density of a set @xmath121 and separateness of the points in @xmath122 play a fundamental role for finding exponential frames @xmath119 for @xmath120 . 
 a sequence @xmath123 is separated if @xmath124    there are many notions for the density of a set @xmath122 . 
 we start with three definitions that are due to beurling .    1 . 
 a lower uniform density @xmath125 of a separated sequence @xmath126 is defined as @xmath127 where @xmath128^d}\right)$ ] , where @xmath129 denotes the cardinal of the set @xmath130 . 
 an upper uniform density @xmath131 of a separated sequence @xmath122 is defined as @xmath132 where @xmath133^d}\right)$ ] . 
 3 .   if @xmath134 , then @xmath122 is said to have uniform beurling density @xmath135 . 
 the limits in the definitions of @xmath125 and @xmath131 exist ( see @xcite ) .    as an example , let @xmath136 be separated and assume that there exists @xmath137 such that @xmath138 , for all @xmath139 
 . then @xmath140 . 
 for the one dimensional case , beurling proved the following theorem . 
 ( beurling ) [ b1 ] let @xmath141 be separated , @xmath142 and @xmath143 $ ] . if @xmath144 then @xmath145 is a frame for @xmath146 . 
 this previous result however is only valid in one dimension . for higher dimensions , 
 beurling introduced the following notion :    the gap @xmath147 of the set @xmath148 is defined as @xmath149    equivalently , the gap @xmath147 can be defined as @xmath150    it is not difficult to show that if @xmath122 has gap @xmath147 , then @xmath151 . for a separated set @xmath122 , and for the case where @xmath152 is the ball @xmath153 of radius @xmath154 centered at the origin , beurling @xcite proved the following result :    [ beurlingthm ] let @xmath126 be separated , and @xmath155 . 
 if @xmath156 , then @xmath145 is a frame for @xmath146 .    for a very clear exposition of some of the beurling density results 
 see @xcite .      the construction in the following theorem ( which is a particular case of theorem  [ wavelet ] ) , generalizes a similar result of @xcite to the irregular case . 
 see also @xcite . 
 [ 1dwvlt ] let @xmath157\cup [ 1/2,1]$ ] , @xmath158 , and let @xmath159 be a real valued function such that @xmath160 $ ] , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 on @xmath163 $ ] . 
 assume that for each @xmath164 , the sequence @xmath165 is separated and that @xmath166 . 
 then for each @xmath167 , the set @xmath168 is a frame of @xmath169 , where @xmath170 . 
 if furthermore the sets @xmath171 are chosen such that the frame bounds @xmath74 and @xmath75 satisfy @xmath172 and @xmath173 , then the set @xmath174 where @xmath175 is a wavelet frame for @xmath18 .    the wavelet frame constructed in the theorem above is of the form + @xmath174 which is slightly different form than the one constructed in theorem  [ wavelet ] . 
 this discrepancy is due to a convenient choice of the irregular set @xmath176 that we have adopted in the statement of the theorem above . 
 note that the wavelets constructed in the theorem above are real and symmetric . 
 actually , if one wants @xmath81 with good decay , @xmath177 can be easily constructed to be @xmath178 , @xmath179 , even @xmath180 .    as a corollary , if we choose the sampling sets @xmath181 to be nested , i.e. , @xmath182 , we get    [ 1dwvltc1 ] let @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath177 be as in theorem [ 1dwvlt ] . 
 assume that the sequences @xmath185 are separated and such that @xmath186 . 
 if @xmath187 , then for each @xmath167 , the set @xmath188 is a frame for @xmath189 . if furthermore the frame bounds @xmath74 and @xmath75 satisfy @xmath172 and @xmath190 , then the set @xmath191 where @xmath192 is a wavelet frame for @xmath18 . 
 since @xmath193 we have that @xmath194)\ge 2 \#(x_{j}\cap [ -r , r]-1 ) $ ] . 
 thus @xmath195 . but @xmath187 , therefore @xmath196 . 
 the corollary then follows directly from theorem [ 1dwvlt ] .    from theorems [ 1dwvlt ] and [ wavelet ] 
 , we immediately get the following corollary . 
 [ 1dwvltc2 ] let @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath197 be as in theorem [ 1dwvlt ] . 
 assume that the set @xmath198 is separated and that @xmath199 . 
 then , the set @xmath200 is a frame of @xmath169 , and the set of functions @xmath201 where @xmath192 is a wavelet frame for @xmath18 .      1 . 
 _ shannon - type wavelet frames _ : we use corollary [ 1dwvltc1 ] , with @xmath202 and @xmath203}$ ] to get wavelet frames of the form @xmath204 these wavelets are not well localized since the decay at @xmath205 is @xmath206 . 
 shannon - type wavelet bases _ : if we choose @xmath181 such that @xmath207 , then by kadec s @xmath208-theorem , we immediately get that @xmath209 constructed above form a wavelet riesz basis for @xmath18 . 
 3 .   _ well localized wavelet frames _ : for faster decay of the wavelet frames , we choose @xmath177 to be a smoother function . let @xmath210}\ast\cdots\ast\chi_{[0,1]}$ ] be the b - spline of degree @xmath211 ( note that @xmath212 $ ] ) . 
 let @xmath213 , and @xmath214 . 
 then we get a wavelet frame of the form @xmath215 for this case the wavelets decay as @xmath216 .      1 .   for @xmath217 , 
 let @xmath218 , and let @xmath219 . 
 if @xmath220 and @xmath221 , then using proposition  [ rdframes ] below for product frames , the set @xmath222 form a frame for @xmath223 ^ 2}$ ] . 
 let @xmath224 , and @xmath225 , then @xmath226 . 
 we can then use theorem [ wavelet ] to construct wavelet frames for @xmath227 : * _ shannon - type radial wavelets _ : let @xmath228 , then @xmath17 is radial . 
 thus the function @xmath81 defined as @xmath229 satisfies @xmath230 , where @xmath231 . 
 we then construct the shannon - like wavelet frame for @xmath227 , as in theorem [ wavelet ] . 
 a related construction of non - separable radial shannon - type frame wavelets and multiwavelets can be found in @xcite , and @xcite . * _ well localized radial wavelets _ : to construct wavelet frames with polynomial decay in space , we let @xmath232 , and construct the wavelet frames using theorem [ wavelet ] ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) . 
 +   radial wavelet frames that are well localized in space . 
 , width=188 ] 2 . 
 the points @xmath233 lie on an irregular grid of the form @xmath234 . 
 however , we may be interested in points @xmath235 that do not lie on irregular grids of the form @xmath234 . for this case , the same constructions above can be used to form wavelets frame for @xmath227 , as long as the gap @xmath236 . 
 3 .   as in the 1-d examples 
 above , we can also use corollary [ 1dwvltc1 ] to construct wavelets on irregular grids satisfying @xmath237 . 
 directional wavelet frames _ : [ examples-4 ] we can easily construct directional wavelet frames as follows : let @xmath238 be a region defined by @xmath239 , and define @xmath240 . 
 let @xmath241 , and @xmath103 be the matrix of a rotation by an angle @xmath242 . 
 let @xmath81 be such that @xmath243 , then we obtain the wavelet frame for @xmath227 of the form @xmath244 . 
 the index @xmath245 codes for the resolution of the wavelet , while the index @xmath246 codes for four possible directions . 
 thus the wavelet frame coefficients encode time scale as well as directional information . 
 clearly one can choose any number of directions and adapt the previous construction . 
 an obvious modification as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , yields wavelet frames with polynomial decay 
 . +   well - localized directional wavelet : the regions @xmath247 and @xmath248 that can be used to construct well localized directional wavelets . 
 , width=188 ] + very nice constructions of smooth directional wavelet frames on regular grids were obtained before in @xcite . 
 _ spiral _ in this example we will define a dilation covering by spiral annulus sectors . + let @xmath249 , and @xmath250 the spiral curve defined by @xmath251 for @xmath252 define @xmath253 to be the rotation of angle @xmath254 : @xmath255 $ ] . 
 the curve @xmath250 satisfies : @xmath256 note that for positive @xmath254 the matrix @xmath257 is expansive . 
 + now we are ready to define the covering elements . set @xmath258 and @xmath259 , for some integer @xmath260 so that @xmath261 . 
 define the spiral annulus sector @xmath262 ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) . 
 so @xmath263 is compact and @xmath264 is a disjoint covering of @xmath265 . 
 + choose @xmath266 sufficiently small and @xmath17 a smooth function that does not vanish in @xmath263 and with support in @xmath267 . 
 define @xmath268 . 
 select a separated set @xmath269 such that @xmath270 . 
 + the set @xmath271 form a wavelet frame of @xmath227 generated by a single wavelet @xmath81 that is band - limited , with good decay and directional in frequency . 
 +   spiral wavelet frames . 
 , width=188 ] 6 . 
 obviously , all the constructions above can be generalized to @xmath5 for any dimension @xmath272 . 
 some of the wavelet frames may be associated with mras . 
 for example , the so called shannon wavelet frame constructed above is associated with the shannon mra @xmath273\ } $ ] , @xmath274 . in general 
 however , the precise relation needs further investigation . 
 in this section we will develop a general method for constructing time - frequency frame atoms in several variables . 
 this construction allows us to construct the previously introduced wavelet frames on irregular grids and with arbitrary dilation matrices or other types of transformations . 
 it also allows us to construct non - harmonic gabor frames on non - uniform coverings of @xmath5 as described in section [ ctfa ] below . 
 let @xmath275 and @xmath276 be non - empty open subsets of @xmath5 , @xmath277 is an invertible @xmath278 map , with @xmath278 inverse @xmath279 , i.e. , @xmath280 is a @xmath278 homeomorphism with @xmath278 inverse @xmath279 . 
 define @xmath281 and @xmath282 , where @xmath283 denotes the derivative of @xmath280 at @xmath284 , @xmath285 $ ] . 
 we have the following proposition :    [ chvar ] with the above notation , assume that @xmath254 is positive and @xmath286 is finite , then if @xmath57 is a frame for @xmath59 with frame bounds @xmath111 and @xmath112 , then @xmath287 is a frame for @xmath288 with frame bounds @xmath289 and @xmath290 . 
 assume that @xmath291 . 
 then for @xmath64 , by an application of the change of variables formula @xmath292 since @xmath293 is finite and bounded away from zero , @xmath294 is in @xmath59 .    using that @xmath295 is a frame of @xmath296 with bounds @xmath297 we have @xmath298 now , 
 applying again the change of variables theorem , we obtain @xmath299 we have that @xmath300 = \left(\det[t^{\prime}(y)]\right)^{-1}$ ] for all @xmath301 . 
 thus @xmath302 that is , from , and we have @xmath303 this proves the upper inequality for @xmath304 . 
 the lower inequality is obtained in the same way , with the obvious modifications . 
 proposition [ chvar ] establishes that @xmath280 defines an isomorphism @xmath305 defined by @xmath306 , thereby transforming frames into frames . by taking @xmath280 to be a translation or a dilation 
 , we get the well known result :    [ transl ] let @xmath307 be an open subset of @xmath5 . 
 let @xmath308 be any point , and @xmath115 an invertible matrix . 
 we have ,    1 . 
 * translation * [ coro-1 ] @xmath57 is a frame for @xmath48 with bounds @xmath111 and @xmath112 , if and only if @xmath309 is a frame for @xmath310 with the same bounds . 2 . 
 * dilation * [ coro-2 ] @xmath57 is a frame for @xmath48 with bounds @xmath111 and @xmath112 , if and only if @xmath311 is a frame for @xmath312 with the same bounds . 
 in fact the corollary remains true if we only assume that @xmath183 is measurable . 
 part  [ coro-1 ] is a direct application of the proposition , for the case that @xmath313 .    for part  [ coro-2 ] , and 
 the transformation @xmath314 , the proposition tells us that @xmath315 is a frame with frame bounds @xmath316 and @xmath317 , therefore dividing each function by @xmath318 we obtain the result . 
 for the next theorem , we need to introduce some definitions . 
 let @xmath319 be a rpu with bounds @xmath68 and @xmath69 . 
 for each @xmath320 set @xmath321    let @xmath322 , and define @xmath323 for a given @xmath324 , we discard all those @xmath167 such that @xmath325 has measure zero 
 . note that if @xmath326 , then we can only claim that @xmath327 is a rpu associated to @xmath328 with constants @xmath324 and @xmath69 . 
 [ unionframe ] let @xmath329 .    1 .   [ unionframe-1 ] 
 assume that @xmath330 is a frame for @xmath331 with lower and upper frame bounds @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively . if @xmath76 and @xmath332 , then @xmath333 is a frame for @xmath4 , with frame bounds @xmath334 and @xmath335 . 
 [ unionframe-2 ] assume that for each @xmath336 , @xmath330 is a frame for @xmath337 with lower and upper frame bounds @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively . if @xmath338 and @xmath339 , then @xmath340 is a frame for @xmath341 , with frame bounds @xmath342 and @xmath335 .    1 .   given @xmath343 and denoting by @xmath344 
 we will first show that @xmath345 for @xmath346 where we used dominated convergence for the interchange of the integral with the sum . 
 the other inequality is analogous . 
 + for each @xmath64 and @xmath343 , we use the fact that @xmath347 is a frame for @xmath331 , and that @xmath348 to obtain @xmath349 so summing over @xmath167 @xmath350 2 .   for the second case 
 we observe that the set @xmath351 forms a rpu associated to @xmath352 with bounds @xmath324 and @xmath69 , for if @xmath353 , @xmath354 furthermore , by hypothesis , @xmath355 these subspaces @xmath337 correspond to the subspaces @xmath331 defined in for the rpu @xmath356 , and therefore we can use the previous result ( applied to @xmath357 instead of @xmath4 ) to conclude that @xmath358 is a frame for @xmath359 . 
 the proof is complete by noting that @xmath360 . 
 * note that in the previous theorem , instead of choosing a frame for the subspaces @xmath331 , we could have chosen any collection of functions of @xmath4 that form an outer frame for @xmath331 . * if @xmath17 is a bounded function and @xmath361 , then it is easy to see that @xmath362 if and only if @xmath363 . 
 so the spaces @xmath331 defined in will coincide in most of the cases with @xmath364 .    as a very important particular case of the previous theorem 
 , we have the following corollaries . 
 [ unionframe - cor ] let @xmath365 be a family of subsets of @xmath5 , not necessarily disjoint , and let @xmath366 be a rpu with constants @xmath367 and @xmath69 not necessarily associated to @xmath28 . 
 assume that @xmath330 is a frame for @xmath368 with lower and upper frame bounds @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively . if @xmath76 and @xmath332 , then    1 . 
 [ unionframe - cor-1 ] if @xmath67 is associated to @xmath28 ( i.e. @xmath369 ) , then @xmath333 is a frame for @xmath370 , with frame bounds @xmath334 and @xmath335 . 
 [ unionframe - cor-2 ] if instead @xmath371 , then also @xmath333 is a frame for @xmath372 , with frame bounds @xmath342 and @xmath335 . 
 denote by @xmath373 the orthogonal projection on the subspace @xmath331 defined in . 
 since @xmath374 forms a frame for @xmath368 with bounds @xmath74 and @xmath75 , then @xmath375 forms a frame for @xmath331 with the same bounds . 
 so , by theorem  [ unionframe ] , @xmath376 forms a frame of @xmath377 with frame bounds @xmath79 and @xmath80 . 
 we obtain part @xmath378 of the corollary observing that : @xmath379    the second part is a consequence of the fact that @xmath380 is a rpu associated to @xmath28 with bounds @xmath324 and @xmath69 and that @xmath381 . 
 therefore we can apply the second part of theorem [ unionframe ] . 
 * for the first case , the set @xmath382 is not necessarily a frame for @xmath383 or even for @xmath384 , even though @xmath385 is a frame for @xmath386 . 
 * in the second case , the subspace @xmath331 is contained in @xmath387 
 . * note that if @xmath67 is a regular partition of unity , then the frame bounds for the frame constructed in the corollary , are @xmath111 and @xmath112 . 
 [ new - cor ] let @xmath388 be a rpu with constants @xmath367 and @xmath69 and @xmath389 and @xmath390be coverings of @xmath5 such that @xmath391 and @xmath392 for all @xmath64 and some constant @xmath393 . 
 assume that @xmath330 is a frame for @xmath368 with lower and upper frame bounds @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively . if @xmath76 and @xmath332 , then @xmath333 is a frame for @xmath6 , with frame bounds @xmath342 and @xmath335 .    as in the proof of the theorem , we have the inequalities @xmath394 on the other side , @xmath395 and then @xmath396 and @xmath397    the following proposition is a direct application of fubini s theorem , and allows us to construct frames in a product space . by induction the theorem 
 can be generalized to hold for any finite number of factors . 
 [ rdframes ] let @xmath398 and @xmath399 be measurable subsets of @xmath400 and @xmath401 respectively , and let @xmath402 and @xmath403 be frames for @xmath404 and @xmath405 with frame bounds @xmath406 and @xmath407 . then @xmath408 is a frame of @xmath409 with frame bounds @xmath410 .    for any function @xmath411 in @xmath409 , 
 @xmath412 which yields the lower frame bound @xmath413 . 
 the upper frame bound @xmath414 can be obtained in a similar fashion . 
 we now particularize our previous results to frames of the form @xmath415 , where @xmath17 is a fixed function . using the fourier transform , 
 these types of frames allow us to construct wavelets @xmath416 with translates on the arbitrary irregular grid @xmath122 and with an arbitrary countable family of invertible @xmath2 matrices @xmath3 ( cf . 
 theorem  [ wavelet ] ) . 
 first as a particular case of corollary [ unionframe - cor ] , we obtain the following proposition . 
 [ genexpdil ] assume that @xmath417 forms a covering of @xmath5 , and let @xmath418 be a rpu with bounds @xmath68 and @xmath69 associated to @xmath28 . 
 assume also that @xmath419 is a frame for @xmath368 with lower and upper frame bounds @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively . 
 if @xmath76 and @xmath77 , then @xmath420 is a frame for @xmath4 with frame bounds @xmath79 and @xmath80 . 
 if @xmath421 , @xmath86 , and @xmath422 are chosen such that @xmath423 , @xmath252 , @xmath424 and @xmath425 , where @xmath250 is a lattice in @xmath5 , then we obtain the standard gabor or weyl - heisenberg frames . 
 thus in general , the construction above can be viewed as non - harmonic gabor frames with variable windows @xmath422 . 
 the following wavelet frame construction is a direct application of the previous proposition . 
 taking @xmath426 , the set @xmath427 is a wavelet frame for @xmath4 with frame bounds @xmath79 and @xmath80 . 
 therefore , there exists a dual frame @xmath428 such that @xmath429    we can also use proposition [ genexpdil ] and beurling theorem [ b1 ] , to obtain a non - harmonic gabor frame as the following example shows :    [ gf ] [ non - harmonic gabor frames ] let @xmath430 $ ] and let @xmath431}\ast\chi_{[0,1]}\ast\chi_{[0,1]}\ast\chi_{[0,1]}$ ] be the b - spline of degree @xmath432 . 
 clearly , @xmath433 . 
 let @xmath185 be sets in @xmath434 chosen such that for each @xmath167 , @xmath435 and such that the frame bounds @xmath74 and @xmath75 satisfy @xmath172 and @xmath173 . then using proposition [ genexpdil ] and beurling theorem [ b1 ] , we obtain a non - harmonic gabor frame of the form @xmath436 . 
 obviously , we can also use a non - uniform partition of @xmath434 and get generalized non - harmonic gabor frames as discussed earlier . 
 if @xmath62 be a measurable subset of @xmath5 , and if the family of sets @xmath28 is defined by means of expanding or contracting @xmath183 , then we obtain the theorems of section  [ wc ] as particular cases of proposition  [ genexpdil ] .      by corollaries  [ transl ]  and  [ unionframe - cor ] 
 , we can construct a frame for @xmath437 starting from a frame for @xmath438 where @xmath104 is _ any _ subset of @xmath5 with nonempty interior . hence to build a frame for @xmath439 it is enough to start with a frame for @xmath440 , where @xmath275 is an open disk . specifically , since any bounded measurable set can be covered by a finite number of translates of @xmath275 , we can use corollary  [ transl](1 ) to find a frame for @xmath439 . 
 we can also expand @xmath275 until it covers @xmath183 and use corollary  [ transl](2 ) . 
 this shows that there are many ways to construct frames for @xmath439 starting from a frame for @xmath440 . 
 obviously , the particular construction will depend on the application . 
 we will describe now two particular constructions .    1 . 
 given a frame for @xmath441 where @xmath104 is a measurable subset of @xmath5 , we will construct a frame for @xmath442 . 
 let @xmath250 be a regular lattice in @xmath5 ( i.e. @xmath443 , where @xmath103 is an invertible @xmath2 matrix with real entries ) , and let @xmath104 be a measurable subset of @xmath5 such that @xmath444 with a finite covering index . 
 let @xmath183 be a measurable subset of @xmath5 and define @xmath445 for @xmath446 . 
 let @xmath447 . by corollary [ transl ] , 
 if @xmath448 is a frame for @xmath449 , then @xmath450 is a frame for @xmath451 . 
 hence , @xmath452 is also a frame for @xmath453 . 
 therefore , by corollary [ unionframe - cor ] , @xmath454 is a frame for @xmath73 . 
 as an example , when @xmath183 is a measurable subset of @xmath5 , @xmath455^d$ ] , and @xmath456 , we have that if @xmath457^d } : k \in k\}$ ] is a frame for @xmath458^d)$ ] , then @xmath459 is a frame for @xmath73 ( recall that @xmath460^d + \gamma)$ ] ) . 
 + it is easy to see that the covering requirement @xmath461 in the previous construction is not restrictive . 
 specifically , we only need @xmath462 , where @xmath254 is any positive real number . furthermore 
 , the construction remains valid if for each @xmath463 we choose a _ different _ set @xmath464 such that @xmath465 is a frame for @xmath449 , and @xmath466 and @xmath467 , where @xmath468 and @xmath469 are the lower and upper frame bounds of @xmath470 . 
 finally , note that if @xmath471 we obtain a frame for @xmath4 . 
 2 .   if @xmath183 is bounded we can construct frames for @xmath442 using theorem  [ beurlingthm ] . 
 let @xmath472 , and @xmath473 such that @xmath474 . 
 let @xmath475 be such that @xmath476 . 
 then using beurlings theorem ( [ beurlingthm ] ) we obtain that @xmath477 is a frame of @xmath478 . 
 so , using corollary  [ transl](1 ) , @xmath479 is an outer frame of @xmath442 , and @xmath480 is a frame for @xmath442 .      in view of the previous results 
 , we will be interested in constructing particular kinds of riesz partitions of unity associated to special coverings of the space . 
 the next results provide the necessary tools to accomplish this task . 
 if @xmath107 is a @xmath481 matrix , we will say that @xmath107 is _ expansive _ , if @xmath482 for every eigenvalue @xmath356 of @xmath107 . 
 we will use the following known result ( see for example @xcite , pg . 
 let @xmath40 be in @xmath483 and @xmath266 . 
 there exists a matrix norm @xmath484 such that @xmath485 where @xmath486 is the spectral radius of the matrix @xmath40 , and there exists a norm @xmath487 in @xmath488 such that @xmath489    as a consequence of this lemma , if @xmath107 is an expansive matrix , then there exists a norm @xmath490 in @xmath488 such that @xmath491 and therefore @xmath492 in particular for every @xmath493 , @xmath494    [ prop * * ] let @xmath107 be a @xmath2 expansive matrix and @xmath495 a bounded set such that    1 . 
 there exists @xmath266 such that @xmath496 . 
 [ prop**1 ] 2 . 
 @xmath497.[prop**2 ]    then @xmath498 , the covering index of the family @xmath499 , is finite , i.e. there exists an integer @xmath500 such that @xmath501 .    for @xmath502 
 define @xmath503 since @xmath504 , it is enough to prove that @xmath505 and @xmath506 are uniformly bounded in @xmath5 . 
 we will see that @xmath505 is uniformly bounded . 
 a similar argument proves the claim for @xmath506 . 
 it is easy to see that @xmath507 thus , if @xmath505 is bounded on @xmath276 , then , by ( [ prop**2 ] ) @xmath505 is bounded in @xmath265 with the same bound . 
 now , using ( [ prop**1 ] ) , we see that there exist @xmath508 such that @xmath509 , for all @xmath510 . 
 fix @xmath510 . 
 if @xmath511 , then there exists @xmath512 such that @xmath513 and @xmath514 and therefore @xmath515 . 
 but since @xmath516 , necessarily there exists @xmath517 such that for every @xmath518 . hence for every @xmath510 , @xmath519 . 
 the next proposition shows the construction of a large class of riesz partitions of unity , for families of sets obtained by dilation of a compact set . 
 [ prop2 ] let @xmath62 be a compact set and @xmath107 a @xmath2 expansive matrix such that    1 . 
 @xmath520 [ prop2 - 1 ] 2 . 
 [ prop2 - 3]@xmath521 . 
 let @xmath17 be any measurable function , and @xmath522 some constants such that    1 . 
 @xmath523 2 . 
 [ prop2 - 5 ] @xmath524 on @xmath183 3 . 
 @xmath525 on @xmath526 , where @xmath527 and @xmath528    then the family of functions @xmath529 is a rpu associated to @xmath530 . 
 if @xmath531 , by ( [ prop2 - 3 ] ) there exists @xmath164 and @xmath532 such that @xmath533 , so by ( [ prop2 - 5 ] ) , @xmath534 now by proposition  [ prop * * ] , the covering index @xmath535 of the family @xmath536 is finite . using ( [ prop2 - 1 ] ) and ( [ prop2 - 3 ] ) 
 , we see that @xmath537 and since @xmath538 which proves the proposition . 
 this proposition generalizes easily to the case where we replace for each @xmath167 , @xmath539 by an invertible matrix @xmath15 in such a way that @xmath540 is a covering of @xmath265 with finite index . 
 the next lemma shows , that the assumption of having a compact set that covers @xmath5 by dilations is actually necessary , if one wants to construct a rpu associated to a covering of @xmath5 of the form @xmath541 , where @xmath276 is a bounded open set .    if @xmath107 is invertible , and @xmath276 is a bounded open set such that    1 . 
 [ lem - i ] there exists @xmath266 with @xmath542 2 . 
 [ lem - ii ] @xmath497    then there exists a compact set @xmath543 such that @xmath544 . 
 it is clearly enough to find @xmath183 such that @xmath545 . 
 let @xmath546 we will prove ( by the contradiction ) that for some @xmath547 , @xmath548 covers @xmath276 by dilations by @xmath107 . 
 assume that for each @xmath547 , there exists @xmath549 such that @xmath550 . 
 since @xmath551 is compact , and @xmath552 , there exists a subsequence @xmath553 and @xmath554 such that @xmath555 . by ( [ lem - i ] ) and ( [ lem - ii ] ) there exists @xmath517 such that @xmath556 , and since @xmath557 is open , @xmath558 for @xmath559 . 
 set @xmath560 and @xmath561 , then @xmath562 for @xmath563 . 
 choose @xmath564 small enough such that @xmath565 , and so @xmath566 . 
 let @xmath567 be such that if @xmath568 , then @xmath569 . 
 then for @xmath570 , and @xmath571 we have @xmath572 and thus @xmath573 so @xmath574 for all @xmath211 such that @xmath575 . 
 this contradicts our assumption that @xmath576 , since , if @xmath568 and @xmath577 , we have @xmath578 , and so @xmath579 . 
 we show next that it is not difficult to construct bounded sets that cover @xmath5 by dilations . 
 let @xmath495 be a bounded set such that @xmath580 , and @xmath107 an expansive @xmath481 matrix . 
 set @xmath581 , then @xmath582 is a covering of @xmath265 with finite covering index . furthermore , if @xmath583 then the sets @xmath584 are disjoint . 
 choose @xmath266 such that @xmath585 . 
 let @xmath586 be an arbitrary point . by equation   @xmath587 , for some norm @xmath487 in @xmath488 . 
 so there exists a positive integer @xmath211 such that @xmath588 , @xmath589 , i.e. , @xmath590 .    since @xmath276 is bounded , and @xmath591 , there exists @xmath592 such that @xmath593 and @xmath594 , i.e. , @xmath595 . 
 the finiteness of the covering index follows from proposition  [ prop * * ] , and if @xmath583 the disjointness property follows immediately .    * 
 if we want to obtain coverings of @xmath596 with compact sets , we can choose the set @xmath49 where @xmath183 is the set constructed in the previous lemma . 
 clearly the sets @xmath597 cover @xmath596 , and if @xmath598 , then @xmath597 are almost disjoint , i.e.  @xmath599 . * 
 even though for _ any _ set @xmath276 it is true that @xmath600 , in general it is not true that the family @xmath601 is disjoint , as the following example shows : let @xmath602 $ ] and @xmath276 the rectangle @xmath603\times[-1,1]$ ] . 
 we can combine the results of this section with theorem  [ wavelet ] , to obtain the following recipe to construct smooth , wavelet frames of @xmath5 associated to a single dilation matrix @xmath107 and an irregular grid . 
 the wavelets obtained by this method can be constructed to have polynomial decay of any degree , as exemplified in section [ wf1d ] . 
 * recipe : *    * select a bounded set @xmath495 such that @xmath580 and @xmath604 . 
 * select a function @xmath17 of class @xmath605 such that @xmath606 on @xmath607 and @xmath608 for some small @xmath266 . * 
 consider a set @xmath609 , such that @xmath122 is separated and @xmath610 , where @xmath611 . 
 then the following collection is a frame of @xmath4 : @xmath612 where @xmath81 is the inverse fourier transform of @xmath17 . 
 we first note that although the set @xmath613 in theorem  [ wavelet ] is a wavelet frame for @xmath4 , it is not in general true that for a fixed @xmath167 the set @xmath614 is a frame , unless the wavelet frame is of shannon - type , hence , not well - localized . 
 thus , for well - localized wavelets , it appears that the reconstruction of a function @xmath343 from the wavelet coefficients @xmath615 can not be obtained in a stable way by first reconstructing at each level @xmath167 and then obtaining @xmath411 by summing over all levels @xmath167 . 
 however what follows shows that this is still possible :      @xmath618 this , together with the assumptions that @xmath619 is a frame for @xmath620 for each @xmath167 , and that @xmath621 , permits to reconstruct @xmath622 using a dual frame @xmath623 of @xmath72 . 
 note that , since @xmath624 is unitary then @xmath625 is a dual frame of @xmath626 for @xmath368 . 
 thus , it is always possible to reconstruct each @xmath627 in a stable way and then obtain @xmath411 by summing up over all levels @xmath167 . 
 one drawback is that the dual frame may not be well - localized , since each @xmath628 may be discontinuous at the boundary of @xmath183 . to treat this problem 
 we simply note that @xmath629 multiplying both sides by @xmath422 we obtain    @xmath630 . 
 if we choose @xmath17 to be in @xmath631 , and if @xmath628 is in @xmath632 , then @xmath633 will be in @xmath631 and therefore decays polynomially in space . 
 hence the partial sums of the series ( [ recfor ] ) will have good convergence properties . 
 we can then sum equation   over @xmath64 to obtain @xmath634 , and then divide by @xmath635 to obtain @xmath636 .

57,"our current hypothesis is that the galaxies and black holes observed today originated over 13 gyr ago , growing from seeds of primordial density perturbations . 
 one can test this hypothesis by studying the star formation rate ( sfr ) history , from the epoch of reionization ( eor ) at redshifts @xmath21 , through the peak era at @xmath22 ( hopkins & beacom 2006 ) down to the present epoch . 
 the feedback of ionizing radiation , kinetic energy , and heavy elements leaves imprints on early stars , supernovae , and galaxies , providing a  fossil record "" that can be detected through abundances in galactic halo stars and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and in the distributions of mass , metallicity , and luminosity of galaxies . 
 determining when and how the universe was reionized by these early sources have been important questions for decades ( gunn & peterson 1965 ; sunyaev 1977 ; robertson et  al . 
 it has been suggested that igm reionization was complete by @xmath23 ( fan et  al . 
 2001 ; gnedin & fan 2006 ; fan et  al . 
 2006 ; hu & cowie 2006 ) , based on strong ly@xmath2  absorption from neutral hydrogen along lines of sight to qsos at @xmath24 . 
 becker et  al . 
 ( 2007 ) and songaila ( 2004 ) used transmission of the ly@xmath2(and ly@xmath25 ) forest out to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , to suggest a smoothly decreasing ionization rate toward higher redshifts . 
 recent surveys of high - redshift galaxies and ly@xmath2  emitters ( bouwens et  al .   2011a ; ouchi et  al . 
 2010 ; kashikawa et  al .  2011 ; ono et  al .  2012 
 ; schenker et  al . 
 2012 ) infer an increasing igm neutral fraction from the declining populations between @xmath3 . 
 further evidence for an increasing neutral fraction comes from the decreasing sizes of ionized  near zones "" associated with quasars between @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( carilli et  al . 
 2010 ) and from the ly@xmath2  damping wing in the transmission profile toward the newly discovered quasar at @xmath30 ( mortlock et  al . 
 these studies all suggest that the igm is becoming increasingly neutral between @xmath31 , marking the end of cosmic reionization when ionized regions overlap and percolate . 
 whether the epoch of full reionization occurs at @xmath0 is still not ascertained . 
 a contrasting estimate of the eor comes from the measured optical depth , @xmath32 , to electron scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in _ wmap-7 
 _ observations ( larson et  al .  2011 ; 
 komatsu et  al . 
 the error bars come from the central 68% in the marginalized cumulative distribution . using additional cosmological parameter constraints , they infer single - epoch reionization at @xmath33 . 
 although such a high redshift could be explained with @xmath34cdm simulations and modeled sfr histories ( choudhury & ferrara 2005 ; trac & cen 2007 ; shull & venkatesan 2008 ) , the cmb observations are at variance with optical surveys that suggest late reionization , unless reionization is a process that extends to higher redshifts .    for a fully ionized igm , including both h and he , the optical depth @xmath14 for @xmath35 ( see section 2.1 ) . in the cmb analysis ( larson et  al . 
 2011 ) , marginalization of @xmath36 with other cosmological parameters allows the possibility of lower optical depth , with a reionization epoch as low as @xmath37 at 95% c.l . 
 one can also invoke a partially ionized igm at @xmath38 , as discussed by many groups ( cen 2003 ; venkatesan et  al . 
 2003 ; ricotti & ostriker 2004 ; benson et  al . 
 2006 ; shull & venkatesan 2008 ) . 
 however , even with the recent progress in finding high-@xmath12 galaxies , we still do not know whether galaxies are the sole agents of reionization 
 . current observations of high-@xmath12 galaxies leave open several ionization scenarios , some involving simple hydrogen reionization at @xmath39 and  reionization at @xmath40 , and others with more complex ionization histories ( bolton & haehnelt 2007 ; venkatesan , tumlinson & shull 2003 ; cen 2003 ) that depend on sfrs at @xmath41 . 
 shull & venkatesan ( 2008 ) demonstrated how the cmb optical depth constrains the sfr and igm metallicity history at @xmath17 , and trenti & shull ( 2010 ) quantified the metallicity - driven transition from population  iii ( metal - free stars ) to population  ii ( stars formed from metal - enriched gas ) . 
 several recent observations provide valuable constraints on the luminosity function of high-@xmath12 galaxies . 
 the number density of galaxies appears to drop rapidly at @xmath17 ( bouwens et  al . 
 2009 , 2010a , b , 2011a , b , c ) . with a comoving sfr density @xmath42 at @xmath43 ( gonzlez et  al .  2010 ; bouwens et  al . 
 2011a ) , the observed galaxies do not produce enough ionizing photons in the lyman continuum ( lyc ) to maintain a photoionized igm against recombinations . 
 however , the luminosity function is steep , and the total lyc budget requires extrapolation to low - luminosity galaxies ( trenti et  al .  2010 ; bouwens et  al . 
 moreover , the conversion from sfr to lyc production rate relies on insecure calibrations from theoretical models and comparison with high - mass , low - metallicity stars . 
 we revisit the calculation of lyc photon production and assess the high-@xmath12 galaxy contribution to reionization . 
 we also analyze several factors , such as the photon escape fraction ( @xmath11 ) , igm clumping factor ( @xmath44 ) , and electron temperature ( @xmath45 ) , which enter the calculation of the  critical star formation rate "" ( @xmath46 ) necessary to maintain a photoionized igm .    in section 2 , we calculate @xmath46 ( @xmath47 mpc@xmath48 ) in a filamentary igm , equating the production rate of lyman continuum ( lyc ) photons with the hydrogen recombination rate . 
 the photoionization rate depends on the mass function of stellar populations , their evolutionary tracks and stellar atmospheres , and the escape fraction , @xmath11 of lyc photons away from their galactic sources . 
 the recombination rate depends on the density and temperature of the igm , properties we explore with cosmological simulations . in section 3 
 , we give our results for the critical sfr at @xmath49 and present our new sfr simulator , a user - friendly interface for calculating @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in section 4 , we discuss the implications for the hydrogen eor . 
 consistency between high - redshift galaxies and cmb optical depth appears to require @xmath0 and a partially ionized igm at @xmath17 . 
 the peak signal from redshifted 21-cm emission would likely occur during the heating period between @xmath52 ( 145163 mhz ) when the hydrogen neutral fraction @xmath53 ( pritchard et  al .  2010 ; lidz et  al . 
 we denote by @xmath1 ( @xmath54 ) the global star formation rate per co - moving volume . using a simple argument ( madau et  al . 
 1999 ) , balancing photoionization with radiative recombination , we estimate the critical sfr to maintain igm photoionization at @xmath17 , assuming that the lyc photons are produced by populations of massive ( ob - type ) stars . 
 because the mass in collapsed objects ( clusters , groups , galaxies ) is still small at high redshift , the igm contains most of the cosmological baryons , at mean density @xmath55 for a hubble constant denoted @xmath56 , we adopt the wmap-7 ( plus bao + @xmath57 ) parameters , @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( komatsu et  al . 
 2011 ) relative to a critical density @xmath60 g  cm@xmath48 . from the corresponding helium mass fraction @xmath62 ( peimbert et  al . 
 2007 ) , we adopt a mean hydrogen number density , @xmath63    in a fully ionized igm , the cmb optical depth back to @xmath64 can be written as the integral of @xmath65 , the electron density times the thomson cross section along proper length , @xmath66 \ ; dz     \ ; , \ ] ] for a standard @xmath34cdm cosmology ( @xmath67 ) with @xmath68^{1/2}$ ] . 
 this integral can be done analytically ( shull & venkatesan 2008 ) , @xmath69       \left [ \ { \omega_m ( 1+z_{\rm rei})^3 + \omega_{\lambda } \}^{1/2 } - 1 \right ] \ ; .\ ] ] in the high - redshift limit , when @xmath70 , this expression simplifies to @xmath71 ( 1+z_{\rm rei})^{3/2 } \approx ( 0.0521 ) \left [ \frac { ( 1+z_{\rm rei})}{8 } \right ] ^{3/2}\ ] ] independent of @xmath72 to lowest order . the helium and electron densities are written @xmath73 and @xmath74 for singly ionized helium , where @xmath75 by number . to these formulae , we add @xmath76 , from electrons donated by  reionized at @xmath77 ( shull et  al . 
 helium therefore contributes @xmath788% to @xmath36 , and a fully ionized igm produces @xmath14 , 0.060 , and 0.070 back to redshifts @xmath79 , 8 , and 9 , respectively . 
 a comoving volume of 1 mpc@xmath80 contains @xmath81 hydrogen atoms . 
 our simple ionization criterion requires a sfr density that produces a number of lyc photons equal to @xmath82 over a hydrogen recombination time , @xmath83^{-1}$ ] . 
 the hydrogen case - b recombination rate coefficient ( osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) is @xmath84 , scaled to an igm temperature @xmath85 . for typical igm ionization histories and photoelectric heating rates , 
 numerical simulations predict that diffuse photoionized filaments of hydrogen have temperatures ranging from 5000  k to 20,000  k ( dav et  al .  2001 ; smith et  al . 
 these are consistent with temperatures inferred from observations of the ly@xmath2  forest at @xmath86 ( becker et  al . 
 2011 ) . 
 owing to gravitational instability , a realistic igm is inhomogenous and filamentary . 
 semi - analytical models of the reionization of the universe often adopt a  clumping factor "" , @xmath87 , to account for inhomogeneity in estimates of the enhanced recombination rate in denser igm filaments . 
 the clumping factor therefore plays an important role in computing the critical sfr density needed to maintain the reionization of the universe . 
 the clumping factor is also used in numerical simulations to implement `` sub - grid physics '' , in which changes in the density field occur on scales below the resolution of the simulation and are also approximated by the factor @xmath44 ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; madau et  al .  1999 ; miralda - escud et  al . 
 2000 ; miralda - escud 2003 ; kohler et  al . 
 2007 ) . 
 we correct the recombination time for density variations scaled to a fiducial @xmath88 , found in the simulations described below . at @xmath43 , 
 the igm filaments have electron density @xmath89 ^ 3 c_h$ ] , and the characteristic times for hydrogen recombination and hubble expansion are , @xmath90^{-3 }   \ ; , \\ 
 t_{\rm h }    & \approx & [ h_0 \omega_m^{1/2 } ( 1+z)^{3/2}]^{-1 } \approx ( 1.18~{\rm gyr } )                     \left [ \frac { ( 1+z)}{8 } \right]^{-3/2 }   \ ;   . 
 \end{aligned}\ ] ] in our calculations , we express the reionization criterion as @xmath91 , where @xmath46 is the critical sfr density ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath92 is the conversion factor from @xmath1 to the lyc production rate ( see section 2.2 ) . 
 we define @xmath11 as the fraction of lyc photons that escape from their galactic sources into the igm ( dove & shull 1994 ) . 
 recent statistical estimates ( nestor et  al . 
 2011 ) suggest that @xmath93 for an ensemble of 26 lyman - break galaxies and 130 ly@xmath2 emitters at @xmath94 , and it could be higher for the lower - mass galaxies that likely dominate the escaping lyc at @xmath24 ( fernandez & shull 2011 ) . the lyc production efficiency , @xmath92 , is expressed in units @xmath95 photons per @xmath96 of star formation , since typical massive stars emit @xmath97 lyc photons over their lifetime . to evaluate @xmath92 
 , we convert the sfr ( by mass ) into numbers of ob - stars and compute the total number of ionizing photons produced by a star of mass @xmath98 over its lifetime . 
 we then integrate over an imf , @xmath99 , with a range @xmath100 . 
 the standard mass range is 0.1 @xmath96 to 100 @xmath96 , but changes in the mass range and imf slope will affect the lyc production substantially . 
 for example , differences in the imf have been associated with higher jeans masses in low - metallicity gas in the high - redshift igm ( abel et  al . 
 2002 ; bromm & loeb 2003 ) , and tumlinson ( 2007 ) and smith et  al . 
 ( 2009 ) noted the potential influence of cmb temperature on modes of high - redshift star formation . 
 consequently , most cosmological simulations or calculations include a metallicity - induced imf transition ( trenti & shull 2010 ) between low - metallicity population  iii star formation and metal - enhanced population  ii .      the number of lyc photons produced per total mass in star formation 
 depends on the imf of the stellar population and is given by the conversion factor @xmath92 . 
 we calculate this conversion by integrating the total number of lyc photons produced over the entire mass in star formation . 
 @xmath101 here , @xmath102 is the lifetime - integrated number of lyc photons as a function of mass calculated from stellar atmosphere models and evolutionary tracks . 
 the imf , @xmath103 , is integrated over the mass range @xmath100 , where @xmath98 is expressed in solar units . in the sfr simulator discussed in section 3.3 , the user can choose between a normal and broken imf power law . 
 the lower integration limit in the numerator , @xmath104 , is the mass at which stars no longer produce significant amounts of lyc photons .    in our calculator , we use and compare two models that calculate @xmath102 . first , using stellar atmospheres and evolutionary tracks ( r.  s.  sutherland & j.  m.  shull , unpublished ) , we find that , over its main - sequence and post - main - sequence lifetime , an ob star of mass @xmath98 produces a total number @xmath105 of ionizing photons , where @xmath106 over the mass range @xmath107 and for metallicities @xmath108 . 
 we have fitted our results to the form @xmath109 , for @xmath110 ( the mass @xmath104 defines the effective lower limit for stars that produce significant numbers of lyc photons ) . for metallicities in the range @xmath111 ( where @xmath112 is the solar metallicity ) and for masses @xmath113 
 , the fitted coefficients are @xmath114 and @xmath115 . 
 thus , for @xmath116 , we have @xmath117 and @xmath118 , while for @xmath119 we have @xmath120 and @xmath121 . inserting these values for @xmath102 into equation ( 8) 
 , we integrate these lyc photon yields over the imf , to derive the conversion coefficient , @xmath92 , from _ total mass _ in star formation to _ total number _ of lyc photons produced ( in units of @xmath95 photons per @xmath96 ) . 
 the integrals in eq . 
 ( 8) can be done analytically as functions of the imf parameters and metallicity . for a salpeter imf ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) 
 we find : @xmath124 ( for @xmath125 ) , @xmath126 ( for @xmath127 ) , and @xmath128 ( for @xmath129 ) . 
 adopting a typical ( low-@xmath130 ) value @xmath131 ( @xmath132 photons per @xmath96 ) , we can solve for the critical sfr for reionization , scaled to clumping factor @xmath6 , escape fraction @xmath7 , and gas temperature @xmath133 : @xmath134^{3 }      \left [ \frac { c_h/3 } { f_{\rm esc}/0.2 } \right ]     \left [ \frac { 0.004 } { q_{\rm lyc } } \right ] t_4^{-0.845 } \ ; .\ ] ] our chosen value of @xmath88 is consistent with recent downward revisions ( pawlik et  al . 
 2009 ) and with our numerical simulations discussed in section 2.3 . 
 escape fractions @xmath135 have been inferred from observations at @xmath40 ( shapley et  al . 
 2006 ; nestor et  al . 
 2011 ) and theoretical expectations ( fernandez & shull 2011 ) . equation ( 9 ) agrees with prior estimates ( madau et  al . 
 1999 ) when adjusted for our new scaling factors , in particular the ratio @xmath136 ) . 
 their earlier paper assumed @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 . 
 our fiducial redshift has increased from @xmath141 to @xmath142 , appropriate for the new discoveries of high - redshift galaxy candidates for reionization . 
 expressed with the same coefficients in eq . 
 ( 9 ) , their coefficient would be nearly the same , @xmath143 at @xmath142 . 
 one of the improvements in our formulation is to better identify the dependences on the physical parameters ( @xmath44 , @xmath11 , @xmath45 ) and the sfr - to - lyc conversion factor ( @xmath144 , which can change with different imfs and atmospheres . 
 a related calculation is the production rate of ionizing ( lyc ) photons per unit volume , needed to balance hydrogen recombinations . with the same assumptions as above , 
 this is @xmath145 ^ 3 t_{4}^{-0.845 }     \left ( \frac { c_h}{3 } \right )    \ ;   .\ ] ] for standard high - mass stars ( o7  v , solar metallicity ) each with lyc photon luminosity @xmath146  s@xmath147 , this rate corresponds to an o - star space density @xmath148 at @xmath142 . 
 schaerer ( 2002 , 2003 ) also computed models of population iii and low - metallicity stars based on non - lte model atmospheres and new stellar evolution tracks and evolutionary synthesis models . 
 the lifetime total number of lyc photons produced per star of mass @xmath98 is @xmath149 . for stars of mass parameter @xmath150 , 
 the number of ionizing photons , @xmath151 , emitted per second per star , is given by : @xmath152     = \left\ { \begin{array}{lll }      43.61 + 4.90x - 0.83x^2 &    z = 0 ,   &    9 - 500 m_\odot , \\      39.29 + 8.55x    &    z=0 ,     &    5 - 9 m_\odot,\\      27.80 + 30.68x-14.80x^2 + 2.50x^3    & z = 0.02 z_\odot , &    7 - 150 m_\odot , 
 \\      27.89 + 27.75x-11.87x^2 + 1.73x^3    &    z= z_\odot , &    7 - 120 m_\odot \\ \end{array }       \right . 
 \label{eq : qvalues}\ ] ]    and the star s lifetime @xmath153 is given by :    @xmath154   = \left\ { \begin{array}{ll }      9.785 - 3.759x+1.413x^2 - 0.186x^3   &    z = 0 , \\ 
 9.59 - 2.79x+0.63x^2   &    z = 0.02 z_\odot , \\ 
 9.986 - 3.497x+0.894x^2    &    z = z_\odot \end{array }       \right . 
 \label{eq : lifetimes}\ ] ]    sample values of @xmath92 and @xmath46 for different imfs are shown in table  1 , for both model atmospheres . 
 one can obtain different values of @xmath92 for power - law imfs by varying their high - mass slope @xmath25 and the minimum and maximum masses . 
 increases in @xmath92 translate into _ decreases _ in critical sfr . 
 for example , at @xmath155 , if the minimum mass is raised to @xmath156 with a salpeter slope ( @xmath157 ) , the lyc production factor rises to @xmath158 , some 2.5 times higher than the equivalent model , @xmath128 for @xmath159 . 
 if the imf is flatter , @xmath160 instead of 2.35 , with minimum mass fixed at @xmath159 , @xmath161 ( 4.6 times higher ) . at the upper end of the imf , 
 if one increases @xmath162 from 100 to 200 @xmath96 , keeping @xmath157 and @xmath163 , one finds @xmath164 ( 1.4 times higher ) . 
 all of these variations can be explored with our reionization / sfr simulator , described in section 3.3 . 
 the critical sfr of @xmath165 can be understood from simple arithmetic . over the 386 myr recombination time 
 ( eq .  [ 6 ] ) with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath142 , approximately 20 million stars are formed per comoving mpc@xmath80 in a salpeter imf ( @xmath166 ) with mean stellar mass @xmath167 . of these stars , a small fraction , @xmath168 , 
 are massive ob stars ( @xmath169 . at an average of @xmath170 lyc photons and escape fraction @xmath7 , these @xmath7814,000 ob stars will produce a net ( escaping ) @xmath171 lyc photons over their lifetime . 
 these photons are sufficient to ionize @xmath81 hydrogen atoms mpc@xmath48 . 
 the simulations used in this study were performed with ` enzo ` , an eulerian adaptive mesh - refinement ( amr ) , hydrodynamical + n - body code ( bryan & norman 1997 ; 
 oshea et  al .  2004 , 2005 ) . 
 smith et  al . 
 ( 2011 ) enhanced this code by adding new modules for star formation , primordial chemistry , and cooling rates consistent with ionizing radiation , metal transport , and feedback . 
 the ionizing background is spatially constant and optically thin , but variable in redshift . at this stage , we have not implemented radiative transfer or spectral filtering by the igm .    for the clumping factor calculation , we ran a simulation on a 50@xmath172  mpc static grid (  unigrid "" ) cube with @xmath173 cells , denoted as run 50_1024_2 in table  1 of smith et  al . 
 the radiative heating from the ionizing background plays an important role in determining the properties of the filamentary structure . as a filament 
 is ionized and heated , its density drops and its temperature rises ; both effects reduce the recombination rate . to study these effects 
 , we ran four moderate - resolution ( 50@xmath172  mpc unigrid cube with @xmath174 cells ) simulations with varying ionizing backgrounds , summarized in table  2 . 
 after initial submission of this paper , we ran a @xmath175 simulation , to check convergence and assess the  cosmic variance "" among eight sub - volumes of the @xmath173 and @xmath175 simulations . 
 the standard uv background was taken from haardt & madau ( 2001 ) , although we also explore new computations of high-@xmath12 sfrs by trenti et  al . 
 ( 2010 ) and haardt & madau ( 2012 ) . 
 these four simulations were : ( 1 ) no photoionizing background ; ( 2 ) uv background ramped up from @xmath176 to @xmath177 ( run 50_512_2 from smith et  al . 
 2011 ) ; ( 3 ) uv background ramped up from @xmath178 to @xmath179 ; and ( 4 ) uv background ramped up from @xmath178 to @xmath179 , but twice as strong as in ( 3 ) . 
 post - processing of the simulations was performed using the data analysis and visualization package , ` yt ` , documented by turk et  al . 
 ( 2011 ) .    for regions of ionized hydrogen of density @xmath180 
 , we calculate the clumping factor , @xmath44 . using two different methods . 
 the first calculation , which has been used in some earlier studies , uses density weighting . in this 
 density field "" ( df ) method we define @xmath181 and average the density fields ( quantities @xmath182 , denoting either @xmath180 or @xmath183 ) where parameter averages are computed by summing over grid cells ( @xmath184 ) , subject to various `` cuts '' on the igm overdensity and gas temperature and weighted by factors , @xmath185 , @xmath186 in the second calculation , we compare the local recombination rate to the global average recombination rate , averaged over density and temperature in cells , @xmath187 where again @xmath188 denotes a weighted average and @xmath189 is the case - b radiative recombination rate coefficient for hydrogen , as tabulated by osterbrock & ferland ( 2006 ) . 
 we refer to this as the  recombination rate "" ( rr ) method .    because the purpose of the clumping factor is to correct for an enhanced recombination rate , we believe @xmath190 to be a more appropriate representation . 
 the recombinations that are important to removing ionizing photons occur in the filamentary structure of the igm , and the clumping factor should only be calculated in these structures . to assess the critical sfr necessary to maintain an ionized medium , we focus on grid cells that are significantly ionized . 
 because a negligible amount of recombination occurs in cells containing mostly neutral gas , these cells should not contribute to the clumping factor . 
 if we do not exclude neutral gas , the clumping factor is extremely high ( @xmath191 ) before the ionizing background is turned on . 
 we find large density gradients between the neutral gas ( uniformly distributed over the simulation ) and the ionized gas . because the clumping factor is a measure of the inhomogeneity of the medium , a large density gradient yields a large value of @xmath44 . 
 if low - density voids are included in the calculation , the larger density gradient leads to an overestimate of the clumping . by setting both upper and lower density thresholds 
 , we can exclude collapsed halos and low - density voids from our calculations . 
 previous studies ( miralda - escud 2000 ; miralda - escud et  al . 
 2003 ; pawlik et  al . 
 2009 ) addressed these issues by setting a density threshold that excludes collapsed halos , but they did not set a lower limit to exclude voids from their calculations . to explore these effects in a filamentary igm 
 , we make various cuts of our data in baryon overdensity ( @xmath192 ) and in temperature , metallicity , and hydrogen ionization fraction ( @xmath193 ) . in our standard formulation , 
 we include only those cells that meet the following criteria : @xmath194 , @xmath195  k , @xmath196 , and @xmath197 . 
 we believe this  data cut "" adequately represents unenriched igm lying on an adiabat ( see figure  19 of smith et  al . 
 we also explore the clumping factor with no lower density threshold ( total range @xmath198 ) . 
 our results , presented in section 3.1 , show a small increase in @xmath199 from the wider range in densities by including low - density cells with @xmath200 . however , these low - density voids do not contribute substantially to the recombination rate .    in summary , 
 our prescriptions for calculating the clumping factor yield a more physical representation of the enhanced recombination rate that is an important component to many reionization models . by not assuming a fully ionized medium and by specifically following @xmath180 , we are able to exclude denser neutral gas that does not contribute appreciably to the recombination rate . 
 we make simple assumptions on the reionization process and reionization history ( section 3.2 ) , turning on the ionizing radiation field at redshifts @xmath142 or @xmath201 and following the thermal history arising from photoelectric heating , radiative cooling , and pressure smoothing ( pawlik et  al . 
 the metal - line and molecular cooling , metal transport , and feedback included in our simulations also allow us to accurately represent the thermodynamics of the gas , which has been shown to have a significant effect on the evolution of the clumping factor . 
 future models will include discrete sources and radiative transfer , accounting for temperature increases arising from photo - heating with spectral hardening ( abel & haehnelt 1999 ) . because our current simulations employ a spatially constant ionizing radiation field , we anticipate carrying out these more realistic situations . 
 early studies of igm clumping adopted high values , @xmath202 at @xmath86 ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) . as discussed earlier , we believe these values are too high for the ionized igm filaments , which have expanded as a result of the heat deposited by lyc photons . the differences between observations and inferred critical sfr densities can largely be attributed to this high clumping factor ( sawicki & thompson 2006 ; bouwens et  al . 
 more recent studies have trended towards less clumping . 
 raievi & theuns ( 2011 ) argue that using a global clumping factor overestimates the recombination rate , and that local values should be used instead . in this study 
 , we calculate the clumping factor for a series of high - resolution cosmological simulations for ionized hydrogen and helium that explore how the photoheating of an ionizing background affects the igm thermodynamics ( density and temperature ) . 
 we impose criteria in overdensity , temperature , metallicity , and ionization fraction to constrain our calculations to igm filaments where recombinations and ionization fronts are most important . 
 the clumping in simulation @xmath203 is calculated as a function of redshift from @xmath204 to @xmath205 for both @xmath206 and @xmath190 , weighted by overdensity and by volume . 
 note that the unigrid simulations automatically yield volume weighting , when averaged over cells . 
 for the remainder of our simulations , we find a power - law overdensity distribution , with an average form @xmath207 . 
 weighting these cells by overdensity gives undue emphasis on small numbers of high - density cells . 
 this method is also biased , since it does not calculate the clumping factor where most of the recombinations are occurring . 
 figure 1 compares the df and rr methods and shows the difference between the different weights used in our calculations . in both methods , 
 weighting by overdensity results in higher clumping factors . 
 the recombination - rate method ( eq .  [ 15 ] ) results in a lower clumping factor because it accounts for both density and temperature effects from the ionizing background on the clumping averages . 
 photoelectric heating during photoionization causes the filaments to expand , lowering the density . 
 the increased electron temperature also reduces the radiative recombination rate coefficient . the df method ( eq .  [ 13 ] ) includes no dependence on the recombination rate coefficient , and therefore only counts the effect of photoheating on the filament density . 
 see section  3.2 for further discussion .    in our current simulations 
 , we turn on a spatially constant uv background at @xmath142 or @xmath201 . 
 the effects of different  density cuts "" in the summation over cells ( see section 2.3 ) are shown in figure 2 . 
 we find little difference at @xmath208 ( turn - on of ionizing radiation ) , and see a small increase in @xmath44 at @xmath209 when we include the lower density cells with @xmath200 . in future , more refined simulations with radiative transfer , we expect photoionization to be initiated in high - density regions , where the stars are located . 
 once the uv background is turned on , lower - density regions are easily photoionized . 
 the photoelectric heating of the uv background causes the filaments to expand and become diffuse , resulting in a lower clumping factor . 
 the elevated temperature also reduces the recombination rate coefficient , which in turn lowers @xmath44 when calculated by the rr method . 
 when calculating a mean recombination rate , only the recombining ionized gas is relevant . 
 by @xmath210 , the igm is nearly completely ionized and only small regions of  remain . 
 as noted earlier , in more refined simulations , the remaining  would be largely self - shielded from the uv background and likely to reside in clumps of high density yet unreached by ionization fronts . 
 figure 3 explores the convergence and cosmic variance among different simulations . in two panels , 
 we compare results from our @xmath174 simulations with larger simulations with @xmath173 and @xmath175 cells . in each panel , we show the average clumping factors , together with those in eight sub - volumes . 
 the average values of @xmath44 agree in the @xmath173 and @xmath175 simulations , and the small ( @xmath211% ) variance among these sub - volumes suggests that the @xmath173 and @xmath175 simulations are converged . over the redshift range @xmath212 in the @xmath175 simulation , the clumping factor is well fitted by a power - law , @xmath213 ^{-1.1 }    \ ;   , \ ] ] representing a slow rise in clumping to lower redshift , after the turn - on of ionizing radiation .      to study the effect of radiative heating from the ionizing background on filamentary structure , we ran a suite of moderate - resolution simulations with different ionizing backgrounds ( see table  2 for details ) . 
 the redshift at which the uv background is turned on affects the clumping factor , causing it to drop and then recover at lower redshift . 
 pawlik et  al . 
 ( 2009 ) attribute this effect to _ jeans filtering _ , where the photo - heating raises the cosmological jeans mass , preventing further accretion onto low - mass halos and smoothing out small - scale density fluctuations . 
 the photoheating also heats the filaments we are focusing on , which lowers the hydrogen recombination rate coefficient , @xmath214 , and causes the filaments to expand ; both of these effects reduce the clumping factor . without a uv background , the clumping continues to rise as the filaments gravitationally collapse . 
 pawlik et  al . 
 ( 2009 ) also claim that the clumping factor at @xmath177 is insensitive to when the background is turned on , as long as it is turned on at @xmath215 . when an ionizing background is introduced , photoheating acts as a positive feedback to reionization by lowering the clumping factor and making it easier to stay ionized . 
 this same photoheating mechanism also suppresses star formation in low - mass halos , which in turn lowers the ionizing photon production rate by star - forming galaxies and acts as a negative feedback to reionization ( pawlik et  al .  2009 ) . 
 these thermodynamic processes affect clumping and structure and emphasize the importance of carefully modeling the strength of feedback processes and their effects on jeans mass . 
 we have explored what happens when the ionizing radiation turned on earlier , especially during the interval @xmath3 marking the transition from a neutral to fully ionized igm . in a series of @xmath174 simulations , 
 we explore the influence of turn - on of photoionizing radiation between redshifts @xmath142 and @xmath201 . 
 figure  4 shows @xmath44 , computed for the moderate - resolution simulations via the density - field method and weighted by volume . 
 we do not plot simulation @xmath216 , since it is identical to simulation @xmath217 . 
 as in the results of pawlik et  al . 
 ( 2009 ) , we find that photoheating from the ionizing background results in a decrease in the clumping factor . 
 the clumping factors fall along two tracks : a higher track at redshifts above the turn - on of the uv background , and a lower one after turn - on . 
 by @xmath141 , we find nearly identical clumping factors for both backgrounds . 
 after a substantial recovery time , the redshift when the background is turned on is not important . before this recovery , 
 the clumping factor of the earlier background is lower by a factor of @xmath782 , resulting in earlier reionization . 
 one can compare the strengths of feedback to reionization , where  positive feedback "" lowers the clumping factor and  negative feedback "" suppresses star formation . 
 at @xmath218 the total stellar mass ( sfr density ) of simulation @xmath219 is 1.19 ( 1.13 ) times lower than that of simulation @xmath220 , while the clumping factor is 1.64 times lower . 
 for simulation @xmath217 , the total stellar mass ( sfr density ) and clumping factor are 1.52 ( 1.49 ) and 1.66 , respectively , times lower than those of simulation @xmath220 . 
 this suggests that the positive feedback introduced by the background is greater than the negative feedback . 
 however , the stellar mass ( sfr density ) does not recover in the same manner as the clumping factor . 
 once photoheating suppresses the formation of small - mass halos , the hubble flow takes over and prevents them from collapsing and forming stars . 
 therefore , the redshift at which the background is turned on determines whether the positive or negative feedback dominates and whether the ionizing background will cause reionization to be accelerated or delayed .      in connection with this project , 
 we have developed a user interface for calculating the critical sfr density @xmath221 needed to maintain the igm ionization at a given redshift . 
 the software computes the effects of variations in the stellar imf ( slope , mass - range ) and model atmospheres , and the redshift evolution of metallicity and gas thermodynamics ( density , temperature , coupling to the cmb ) . 
 the clumping factor and lyc escape fraction are free parameters in the calculator . 
 our simulations find ranges of @xmath222 depending on redshift , overdensity , and thermal phase of the ( photoionized or shock - heated ) igm . 
 for the new @xmath175 simuation , the global mean clumping factor is @xmath223 , with a power - law fit @xmath224^{-1.1}$ ] for redshifts between @xmath212 . 
 this calculator is a useful tool for determining the population of galaxies responsible for reionization . 
 the critical sfr per co - moving volume ( eq . [ 9 ] ) 
 is obtained by balancing the production rate of lyc photons with the number of hydrogen recombinations . here 
 , @xmath225 is the clumping factor of ionized hydrogen , @xmath11 is the escape fraction of lyc photons from their host galaxies , and @xmath226 is the temperature scaled to @xmath227  k. the conversion factor , @xmath92 , from stellar mass to total number of lyc photons produced , is regulated by the imf and model atmospheres . 
 the user has the option of controlling these parameters to determine the resulting critical sfr density , subject to several observational constraints . 
 this simulator can be accessed at http://casa.colorado.edu/~harnessa/sfrcalculator with an ` html ` interface for easy use . 
 two standard tests of the sfr use the simulator to calculate the ionization histories of  and  and compare them to the ionized volume filling factor , @xmath228 , and the cmb optical depth , @xmath51 . 
 the calculator derives @xmath51 by integrating the differential form of eq . 
 ( 3 ) for various sfr histories and parameters . 
 the average evolution of @xmath229 is found by numerical integration of the rate equation ( madau , haardt , & rees 1999 ) expressing the sources and sinks of ionized zones , @xmath230 the source term , @xmath231 , represents the net ionizing photon production rate , computed from selected models of the sfr density , @xmath1 . here , @xmath232 is the mean hydrogen number density , and @xmath233 is the hydrogen recombination timescale , which depends on @xmath44 as shown in eq . 
 the igm is assumed to be fully ionized when @xmath234 . 
 we integrate a similar equation for @xmath235 to follow  photoionization in the qso 4-ryd continuum . 
 we use the qso emissivities at 1 ryd ( haardt & madau 2012 ) , extrapolated to 4 ryd assuming a spectrum with specific flux @xmath236 . 
 figure  5 shows ionization histories , quantified by @xmath228 and @xmath51 , for various values of clumping factor , escape fraction , igm temperature , and lyc - production efficiencies ( @xmath92 ) . 
 we adopt the sfr history from trenti et  al . 
 ( 2010 ) with an evolving luminosity function . 
 our standard model adopts @xmath6 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , and @xmath131 ( @xmath239 photons / m@xmath240 ) . 
 different curves show the effects of changing @xmath44 and @xmath11 , including two models in which these parameters evolve with redshift . with these parameters , we are typically able to complete reionization by @xmath43 , consistent with observations of gunn - peterson troughs , redshift evolution in ly@xmath2  emitters , and igm neutral fraction 
 . the model with a constant @xmath241 does not complete the ionization until @xmath242 , which is far too late . 
 thus , we be believe that lyc escape fractions must be considerably larger ( @xmath243% ) perhaps evolving to higher values at @xmath24 shown by green and magenta curves . 
 figure 6 compares the dependence of @xmath228 and @xmath51 on sfr histories , computed with an evolving luminosity function ( trenti et  al . 
 2010 ) and new calculations ( haardt & madau 2012 ) of the star formation rate density , @xmath244 . 
 figure 7 compares the effects of two choices of model atmospheres , with a fixed sfr history from trenti et  al . 
 the on - line calculator provides ionization fractions , @xmath228 and @xmath245 , together with cmb optical depth , @xmath51 . in the simulator 
 , users can select other igm parameters and sfr histories . 
 the main difference between the two sfr models lies in the assumptions at @xmath246 . 
 haardt & madau ( 2012 ) rely on an empirical extrapolation of the star formation rate as a function of redshift , while trenti et  al . 
 ( 2010 ) adopt a physically motivated model based on the evolution of the dark - matter halo mass function . 
 the two approaches are similar at @xmath247 , but differ significantly at higher redshift , where an empirical extrapolation does not capture the sharp drop in the number density of galaxies observed at @xmath248 ( see figure 8 in oesch et  al . 
 2011 ) . as a consequence , 
 the reionization history from the haardt & madau ( 2012 ) model is more extended at high @xmath12 , especially when the efficiency of reionization is increased because of evolving clumping factor and escape fraction ( our preferred models , green and magenta curves in fig . 
 the two models yield quite different predictions for the duration of reionization , defined as the redshift interval , @xmath249 , over which @xmath229 evolves from 20% to 80% ionized . 
 our preferred sfr models ( green and magenta lines in fig .  5 ) have @xmath19 ( from @xmath250 to @xmath251 ) , whereas the haardt - madau sfr histories exhibit a more extended interval , @xmath252 ( from @xmath253 to @xmath43 ) . 
 this difference in @xmath249 could be tested by upcoming 21-cm experiments ; see bowman & rodgers ( 2010 ) for an initial constraint , @xmath254 . 
 figure 8 illustrates a third constraint on the reionization epoch ( pritchard et  al . 
 2010 ; lidz et  al . 
 2011 ) comparing sfr histories with estimates of the ionizing background at @xmath255 ( fan et  al . 
 2006 ; bolton & haehnelt 2007 ; haardt & madau 2012 ) . the lyc co - moving emissivity ( in photons s@xmath147 
 mpc@xmath48 ) , defined as @xmath231 , can be related to the ionizing background at @xmath256 , using recent estimates of the hydrogen photoionization rate , @xmath257 , from haardt & madau ( 2012 ) and the lyc mean free path , @xmath258 , from songaila & cowie ( 2010 ) . 
 the lyc emissivity is proportional to the star formation rate density , computed from our halo mass function model ( trenti et  al . 
 2010 ) , integrated down to absolute magnitudes @xmath259 ( bouwens et  al . 
 2011a ) or to @xmath260 , the faint limit suggested by trenti et  al . 
 we adopt a fiducial lyc production parameter @xmath131 , corresponding to @xmath239 lyc photons produced per @xmath96 of star formation , and we use two different models for lyc escape fraction , @xmath11 ( constant at 20% and varying with redshift ) . for quantitative values 
 , we assume an ionizing background with specific intensity , @xmath261 ( in units erg  @xmath262  s@xmath147  sr@xmath147  hz@xmath147 ) with power - law index @xmath263 at energies above @xmath264 ryd . the hydrogen photoionization rate is @xmath265 $ ] for a hydrogen photoionization cross section @xmath266 with @xmath267  @xmath268 . for this spectrum , 
 the frequency - integrated ionizing intensity is @xmath269 , and the lyc photon flux ( photons  @xmath262  s@xmath147 ) integrated over all solid angles is @xmath270 .

 ( 2011 ) , namely @xmath277 , @xmath278 , an ionizing spectral index @xmath279 , and redshift @xmath280 , at which songaila & cowie ( 2010 ) fit @xmath281 proper mpc . 
 our parameter @xmath131 corresponds to the lidz et  al . 
 ( 2011 ) lyc photon production calibration , @xmath282 per @xmath47 of star formation . 
 however , our coefficient , @xmath283 , is slightly larger than their value , @xmath284 , an effect that may arise from our different method of relating @xmath273 to the ionizing radiation field and sfr .    more careful examination of these parameters suggests that , at @xmath285 , the hydrogen ionization rate @xmath286 , given in table 3 of haardt & madau ( 2012 ) , and the observed mean free path , @xmath258 , at @xmath280 may be closer to 6 proper mpc ( see figure 10 of songaila & cowie 2010 ) . 
 rescaling to those two parameters , we find a similar coefficient of @xmath287 . 
 this sfr density at @xmath255 ( see also figure 8) is comparable to the critical value needed to maintain reionization at @xmath142 , but the observed rates and mean free paths are declining rapidly with redshift . 
 all three constraints on sfr suggest that full reionization is more likely to occur at redshift @xmath0 than at @xmath288 .

 the major results of our study can be summarized with the following points :    1 . 
 we calculated the critical star formation rate required to maintain a photoionized igm , incorporating four free parameters ( @xmath44 , @xmath11 , @xmath45 , @xmath303 ) that control the rates of lyc photon production and radiative recombination . 
 our best estimate at @xmath142 is @xmath304 ^ 3   ( c_h/3)(0.2/f_{\rm esc } ) t_4^{-0.845}$ ] for fiducial values of igm clumping factor @xmath305 , lyc escape fraction @xmath7 , temperature @xmath8  k , and standard imfs and low - metallicity stellar atmosphere ( @xmath131 ) . 
 an epoch of full reionization at @xmath0 is consistent with recent optical / ir measurements of sfr history and a rising igm neutral fraction at @xmath3 , marking the tail end of reionization . 
 these observations include the decrease in numbers of high-@xmath12 galaxies and ly@xmath2  emitters and igm damping - wing intrusion into the ly@xmath2  transmission profiles in high-@xmath12 qsos . 
 our newly developed sfr and reionization calculator , now available on - line at + http://casa.colorado.edu/~harnessa/sfrcalculator , allows users to calculate the ionization history , critical sfr , and cmb optical depth , and to assess whether observed sfrs , imfs , and other parameters are consistent with igm reionization . 
 4 .   reconciling late reionization at @xmath0 with @xmath13 of the cmb 
 likely requires an epoch of partial ionization . 
 a fully ionized igm back to @xmath79 produces @xmath306 , and an additional optical depth , @xmath16 , may arise from early sources of uv / x - ray photons at @xmath17 . 
 alternatively , one can appeal to the likelihood contours from wmap , which allow optical depths as low as @xmath307 ( 95% c.l . ) 
 the _ planck _ experiment may clarify the situation in several years . 
 if the eor is more complex , as we suggest , then redshifted 21-cm experiments should focus on the interval @xmath308 , corresponding to frequencies 124167 mhz , for the maximum signal of igm heating ( @xmath309  mk ) produced when the hydrogen neutral fraction @xmath53 ( pritchard et  al . 
 2010 ) . 
 we conclude by speculating about which future observations can best constrain the eor . 
 additional data from from the _ planck _ mission should provide confirmation of the cmb optical depth with smaller error bars . 
 this information will constrain the additional amount of ionization at @xmath17 and narrow the range @xmath310 produced by high - redshift sources in the partially ionized igm . ongoing surveys for high-@xmath12 galaxies , ly@xmath2  emitters , and qso near - zone sizes will better quantify the rise of neutral fraction , @xmath311 at @xmath312 . on the theoretical front 
 , we are running larger igm simulations on @xmath175 and @xmath313 unigrids and will add discrete sources of ionizing radiation and radiative transfer in order to capture the heating and clumping more accurately . 
 we will also include source turn - on at @xmath208 to test the decrease and recovery of @xmath44 , as seen in figures 3 and 4 . 
 finally , we plan to carry out more detailed modeling of the  ( 21-cm ) signal , coupled to the kinetic and spin temperatures driven by heating at @xmath17 . 
 as described earlier , the duration of the reionization transition and the 21-cm emission during the heating phase could provide discriminants of various sfr histories at @xmath24 .

58,"analysis of large amounts of high - dimensional big data is of great interest since it illuminates the underlying phenomena . to cope with high - dimensional big data 
 , it is sometimes assumed that there are some ( unobservable ) dependencies between the parameters of the multidimensional data points . 
 mathematically , it means that the data is sampled from a low - dimensional manifold that is embedded in a high dimensional ambient space . 
 dimensionality reduction methods , which rely on the presence of a manifold , map the data into a low - dimensional space while preserving certain qualities of the low - dimensional structures of the data .    a broad class of dimensionality reduction methods 
 are based on kernel - based methods . 
 the kernel encapsulates a measure of mutual affinities ( or similarities ) between data points . 
 particularly , if the kernel is semi - positive definite , it can be considered as gram matrix of inner products , which correspond to an implicit mapping of the data to a high dimensional space , typically refereed to as the feature space . 
 depending on the chosen kernel , the new geometry of the data in feature space , represents important features of the data . 
 kernel - pca is a technique that generalizes the well known principal component analysis ( pca )  @xcite . while the latter detects principal directions of data in euclidean space and then projects the data onto them , the former does the same in the feature space . 
 it is resulted in a low dimensional euclidean representation ( embedding ) of the data that approximates the feature space geometry . 
 the dimensionality of the embedding space is affected by the decay rate of the kernel s spectrum . 
 examples of kernel methods are diffusion maps ( dm )  @xcite , local linear embedding ( lle )  @xcite , laplacian eigenmaps  @xcite , hessian eigenmaps  @xcite and local tangent space alignment  @xcite .    from a practical point of view , kernel methods have a significant computational drawback : spectral analysis of the kernel matrix becomes impractical for large datasets due to high computational complexity required to manipulate a kernel matrix . 
 their global nature is also disadvantageous . 
 furthermore , in many applications , the analysis process is dynamic due to data accumulation over time and , as a result , the embedding has to be modified once in a while . 
 processing a kernel matrix in memory becomes impractical for large datasets due to their sizes . 
 a general solution scheme embeds a subset of the source data that is usually referred to as a training dataset . 
 then , the embedding is extended to any out - of - sample data point . 
 the nystrm method  @xcite , which is widely used in integral equations solvers , has become very popular as an out - of - sample extension method associated with dimensionality reduction methodology . for a review of spectral clustering and nystrm extension see section @xmath0 in  @xcite . 
 the nystrm extension scheme has three significant disadvantages : ( a ) it requires diagonalization of a matrix that costs @xmath1 operations @xcite . 
 ( b ) it requires working with a matrix which may be ill - conditioned due to fast decay of its spectrum , and ( c ) it is unclear how to choose the length parameter @xmath2 since the output is sensitive to the choice of @xmath2 . 
 some limitations of nystrm extension are overcome in @xcite . 
 geometric harmonics ( gh )  @xcite is another out - of - sample extension method . 
 it uses the nystrm extension of eigenfunctions of a kernel defined on the data . in order to avoid numerical instabilities 
 , it uses only the significant spectral components . in that sense , the gh framework filters out high frequencies , which are determined by the kernel , rather than by the data 
 this problem , additionally to the fixed interpolation distance problem , is treated in  @xcite , where a multiscale interpolation scheme is introduced . 
 another multiscale approach , which aims to solve the aforementioned limitations , was recently introduced in  @xcite . 
 both methods project the objective function on the eigencomponents of a series of kernels , which cover the complete spectrum of that function . 
 the difference between these methods is in the extraction of principal components while the former is spectral and the latter is interpolative . 
 all these methods use a kernel matrix ( or , perhaps , its low rank approximation ) as an interpolation matrix . 
 this mechanism is strongly related to a variety of isotropic interpolation methods that employ radial basis functions ( rbf ) . 
 such methods are used for scattered data approximation , where the data lies in a metric space . 
 more details about rbf and scattered data approximation can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .    in this paper 
 , we employ the manifold assumption to establish an anisotropic out - of - sample extension . 
 we suggest a new anisotropic interpolation scheme that ascribes for each data point a likelihood neighborhood . this likelihood is based on geometric features from the dimensionality reduction map by using pca of the maps image . 
 incorporation of such neighborhood information produces a linear system for finding the out - of - sample extension for this data point . 
 this method also provides an abnormality measure for a newly - mapped data point . 
 the paper has the following structure : section [ sec : setup ] introduces the problem and the needed definitions . 
 the construction of the out - of - sample extension is described in section [ sec : alg_const ] . 
 section  [ sec : feature based variance ] establishes the geometric - based stochastic linear system on which the interpolant is based . 
 three different interpolants are presented where each is based on different geometric considerations . in section [ sec : bound ] , an analysis of interpolations error is presented for the case of lipschitz mappings . 
 computational complexity analysis of the scheme is presented in section  [ sec : complexity ] . 
 experimental results for both synthetic data and real - life data are presented in section  [ sec : examples ] . 
 let @xmath3 be a compact low - dimensional manifold of intrinsic dimension @xmath4 that lies in a high - dimensional ambient space @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , whose euclidean metric is denoted by @xmath7 . 
 let @xmath8 be a smooth , lipschitz and dimensionality reducing function defined on @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 is a @xmath4-dimensional manifold . 
 let @xmath12 be a finite training dataset , sufficiently dense sampled from @xmath3 , whose image @xmath13 under @xmath8 was already computed . 
 given an out - of - sample data point @xmath14 , we aim to embed it into @xmath15 while preserving some local properties of @xmath8 . 
 the embedding of @xmath16 into @xmath15 is denoted by @xmath17 . 
 it is referred to as the extension of @xmath8 to @xmath16 . 
 the proposed extension scheme is based on the local geometric properties of @xmath8 in the neighborhood of @xmath16 , denoted by @xmath18 . 
 specifically , the influence of a neighbor @xmath19 on the value of @xmath17 depends on its distance from @xmath16 and the geometry of the image @xmath20 of @xmath18 under @xmath8 . 
 this approach is reflected by considering @xmath17 as a random variable with mean @xmath21 and a variance @xmath22 that depends on both the distance of @xmath16 from @xmath23 and on some geometric properties of @xmath20 that will be detailedly discussed in section  [ sec : tangent space ] . 
 mathematically , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a random variable with mean @xmath26 and variance @xmath27 that , as previously mentioned , depends on the local geometry of @xmath8 in the neighborhood @xmath18 of @xmath16 . 
 thus , we get @xmath28 equations for evaluating @xmath17 , one for each neighbor @xmath19 . 
 the optimal solution then , is achieved by the generalized least squares approach described in section  [ sec : gls ] .      in this section , 
 we briefly describe the gls approach that will be utilized to evaluate @xmath17 . in general 
 , the gls addresses the problem of a linear regression that assumes neither independence nor common variance between the random variables . 
 thus , if @xmath29 are random variables that correspond to @xmath30 data points in @xmath31 , the addressed regression problem is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an @xmath34 matrix that stores the data points as its rows and @xmath35 is an error vector . respectively to the aforementioned assumption , the @xmath36 conditional covariance matrix of the error term @xmath37 is not necessarily scalar or diagonal . 
 the gls solution to eq . 
 [ eq : regression ] is @xmath38 the mahalanobis distance between two random vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the same distribution with conditional covariance matrix @xmath41 is @xmath42    [ obs : mahlanobis ] the mahalanobis distance in eq . 
 [ eq : mahal_dist ] measures the similarity between @xmath39 and @xmath40 in respect to @xmath41 . 
 if the random variables are independent , then @xmath41 is diagonal . 
 then , it is more affected by low variance random variables and less by high variance variables .    the gls solution from eq . 
 [ eq : gls_solution ] , minimizes the squared mahalanobis distance between @xmath43 and the estimator @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 further details concerning gls can for example be found in  @xcite .    in our case , for a fixed out - of - sample data point @xmath14 with its @xmath46 neighbors , a linear system of @xmath30 equations , each of the form of eq . 
 [ eq : basic_rv ] , is solved for @xmath17 . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath47 . the matrix formulation of such a system is @xmath48 where @xmath49^t$ ] is the @xmath50 identity blocks matrix , @xmath51 is a @xmath52-long vector , whose @xmath53-th section is the @xmath54-long constant vector @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a @xmath52-long vector , whose @xmath53-th section is the @xmath54-long vector @xmath57 . 
 the vector @xmath56 encapsulates the images of @xmath18 under @xmath8 such as the neighborhood of @xmath17 in @xmath11 . 
 the corresponding covariance matrix is the @xmath58 blocks diagonal matrix @xmath41 , @xmath59 whose @xmath53-th diagonal element is @xmath60 . 
 therefore , due to eq . 
 [ eq : gls_solution ] , the gls solution to eq . 
 [ eq : system_rv ] is @xmath61 and it minimizes the mahalanobis distance @xmath62 that measures the similarity ( with respect to @xmath41 ) between @xmath17 and its neighbors @xmath63 in @xmath11 , which are encapsulated in @xmath56 . once @xmath41 is defined as an invertible covariance matrix @xmath17 , as defined in eq . 
 [ eq : psi_hat_solution ] , is well posed . 
 the definition of @xmath41 depends on the definition of @xmath64 for any @xmath65 , which can be chosen subjected to the similarity properties to be preserved by @xmath8 . 
 these properties are discussed in section  [ sec : feature based variance ] . once eq . 
 [ eq : psi_hat_solution ] is solved for @xmath17 , the mahalanobis distance from eq . 
 [ eq : maha measure ] provides a measure for the disagreement between the out - of - sample extension of @xmath8 and @xmath16 with the surrounding geometry . 
 thus , a large value of @xmath66 ( eq . [ eq : maha measure ] ) indicates that @xmath16 resides outside of @xmath3 and thus , in data analysis terminology , it can be considered as an anomalous data point . 
 as mentioned in section  [ sec : gls ] , the gls solution minimizes the mahalanobis distances between @xmath17 and its neighbors according to the stored information in @xmath41 . 
 thus , if the variances are determined subjected to some feature , then @xmath17 , which is defined in eq . 
 [ eq : psi_hat_solution ] , is the closest point in @xmath11 to its neighbors with respect to this feature . 
 the idea of algorithm [ alg : pbe ] is to get a linear approximation for the local geometry of @xmath8 and then device an out - of - sample extension that best preserves that linear demand using gls . 
 the gls solution also provides the error , which , as described in section [ sec : gls ] , is considered as an anomalous score .    * input : * @xmath67 - training dataset . 
 + @xmath68 - training dataset after dimensionality reduction . 
 + @xmath16 - an out of sample data point . + 
 * output : * @xmath43 - an out - of - sample extension of the data point @xmath16 that preserves the local properties of @xmath8 . 
 + @xmath69 - an abnormality score of the data point @xmath16 . 
 find a set @xmath70 ( eq . [ neighborhood_epsilon ] ) of the nearest neighbors with radius @xmath71 to the data point @xmath16 in @xmath72 . for each data point @xmath73 , 
 construct a weighted linear system @xmath74 for @xmath43 where the construction of @xmath41 is described in section [ sec : feature based variance ] . 
 @xmath43 is the optimal solution for the combined weighted linear system , as described in section [ sec : gls ] . 
 when gls is solved , find the residual @xmath69 of the solution . 
 in this section we present a construction of @xmath41 , which is the weight of the linear system for @xmath43 , such that the resulted out - of - sample extension @xmath17 agrees with principal direction of its neighborhood in @xmath11 . 
 the neighborhood @xmath70 can be defined variously . in this paper 
 , we use the definition @xmath75 for some positive @xmath71 , which ensures locality of the extension scheme . 
 the parameter @xmath71 should be fixed according to the sampling density of @xmath3 such that @xmath76 . 
 this restriction enables to detect the principal directions of the image of @xmath77 in @xmath11 .    in the rest of this section 
 , we present the construction of @xmath41 . 
 the first construction , presented in section  [ sec : basic ] provides a mechanism to control the rate of influence of a data point @xmath78 on the value of @xmath17 as a function of its distance from @xmath16 . the second construction for @xmath41 , presented in section  [ sec : tangent space ] , incorporates information regarding principal variance directions of @xmath70 such that the resulted out - of - sample extension @xmath17 agrees with these directions . 
 although the definition of @xmath79 provides locality for the scheme computation , it is reasonable to require that data points in @xmath79 , which are distant from @xmath16 , affect less than close data points . for this purpose , 
 an affection weight @xmath80 is assigned to each data point @xmath81 . 
 of course , any other decreasing function of the distance between @xmath16 and @xmath23 can be utilized . by defining the variance @xmath82 to be proportional to the distance @xmath83 such that @xmath84 
 , then we get a diagonal matrix @xmath41 , whose @xmath53-th diagonal element is @xmath85 thus , due to observation  [ obs : mahlanobis ] , close data points in @xmath70 affect @xmath17 more than data points that are far away .      in this section , we present a covariance matrix that encapsulates geometric information concerning the manifold @xmath11 . 
 the covariance matrix @xmath41 is set such that the resulted extension obeys the lipschitz property of @xmath8 . 
 let @xmath86 be the tangential space to @xmath11 in @xmath57 and let @xmath87 be the orthogonal projection on @xmath86 . 
 we denote the tangential component of @xmath25 by @xmath88 , and its orthogonal complement by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the identity transformation . 
 proposition  [ prop : tang - perp - comp ] quantifies the tangential and perpendicular components of @xmath25 from eq . 
 [ eq : basic_rv ] , as functions of the curvature of @xmath11 in @xmath23 and @xmath91 . 
 [ prop : tang - perp - comp ] let @xmath92 and assume that the curvature of @xmath11 in @xmath23 is bounded by a constant @xmath93 . if @xmath8 is a lipschitz function with constant @xmath30 , then @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    without loss of generality 
 it is assumed that @xmath96 and @xmath97 . 
 we denote the graph of the manifold @xmath11 in the neighborhood of @xmath98 by the function @xmath99 , where the data points in @xmath11 are @xmath100 . 
 thus we get @xmath101 and @xmath102 . 
 let @xmath103 be a data point in the neighborhood of @xmath23 and let @xmath104 . 
 namely , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . 
 then , the taylor expansion of @xmath107 around @xmath98 yields @xmath108 . since @xmath8 is assumed to be a lipschitz function with constant @xmath30 , we get @xmath109 . 
 thus , we get that @xmath110 and @xmath111 .    from eq . 
 [ eq : basic_rv ] , proposition  [ prop : tang - perp - comp ] provides a relation between the tangential and perpendicular components of @xmath25 thus , @xmath51 from eq . 
 [ eq : system_rv ] is the @xmath52-long vector , whose @xmath53-th section is the @xmath54-long vector @xmath112 , where its first @xmath4 entries are the tangential weights and the rest @xmath113 are the perpendicular weights . 
 the corresponding covariance matrix is the @xmath114 blocks diagonal matrix @xmath41 , whose @xmath53-th diagonal element is the @xmath115 diagonal matrix @xmath116 where the first @xmath4 diagonal elements are @xmath117 ( see eq . 
 [ eq : weights ] ) , and the rest @xmath113 are @xmath118.then , the solution is given by eq . 
 [ eq : system_rv ] while @xmath119 and @xmath56 remain the same .      in real life applications , 
 in order to use the tangential space to @xmath11 in @xmath57 , it has to be first approximated by using its neighboring data . in this section , 
 we approximate the tangential space and the principle directions of the manifold @xmath11 at @xmath57 . 
 then , these approximations are incorporated in the construction of @xmath41 to ascribe heavy weights to the tangential direction and less significant weights to the perpendicular ones . 
 the principle directions of the data and the variance of each direction are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of a data points @xmath57 , respectively . 
 this covariance matrix is also known as the pca matrix . 
 a multi - scale version of the local pca algorithm is analyzed in  @xcite and it can be used in our analysis . 
 it is important to take at least as many data points as the dimensionality of @xmath11 . 
 the covariance matrix of a data point @xmath57 is computed in the following way : for simplicity of calculations , we take as the set of neighbors of @xmath57 the set @xmath120 . then , we form the @xmath34 matrix @xmath33 , whose rows in the aforementioned set are @xmath121 accordingly , we define @xmath122 since we take the same set of data points then for all @xmath123 and @xmath53 we have @xmath124 . to make the calculation and stability issues easier 
 we add the @xmath125 component to all the diagonal components . 
 consequently , we define : @xmath126    since @xmath127 is positive definite , it is invertible . 
 we notice that it was possible to add the @xmath128 weight components only to the least significant directions of the covariance matrix by computing the svd @xcite of the covariance matrix . 
 this does not improve the accuracy significantly but adds more complexity to the computation . 
 @xmath41 is a block diagonal matrix with the same structure as appears in eq . 
 [ eq : w ] . 
 another option is to make different estimations for the tangential space in different data points by using different sets of data points in the covariance matrix computation . while this estimation should be more accurate , it is more computationally expensive . 
 in this section , we prove that the error of the out - of - sample extension is bounded in both cases of distance - based weights ( eq .  [ eq : simple w ] ) and the tangential - based weights(eq . 
 [ eq : tang weights ] ) . 
 it means that for any function @xmath129 , which agrees on a given set of data points and satisfies certain conditions , the out - of - sample extension @xmath17 of the data point @xmath16 is close to @xmath130 . 
 first , we prove the consistency of the algorithm . in other words , 
 the out - of - sample extension of data points , which coverage to an already known data point , will converge to its already known image . 
 [ lemma:5 ] assume @xmath131 . if @xmath132 then @xmath133 . 
 an intuition for the proof of lemma [ lemma:5 ] is that the distance from the point @xmath134 is inversely proportional to the weight of the equation @xmath135 in eq . 
 [ eq : system_rv ] , therefore , when @xmath136 , the distance tends to @xmath98 and the weight tends to @xmath137 . notice that when @xmath138 then , according to eq . 
 [ eq : weights ] , @xmath139 and the out - of - sample extension is undefined . 
 the dataset @xmath140 is called a @xmath141-net of the manifold @xmath3 if for any data point @xmath142 there is @xmath143 such that @xmath144 . 
 assume that @xmath72 is a @xmath141-net of @xmath3 . 
 let @xmath145 be a lipschitz function with a constant @xmath146 . if @xmath147 and @xmath148 is computed using the weights in eq . 
 [ eq : simple w ] , then @xmath149 . 
 we denote by @xmath150 the set of data points in the @xmath151 neighborhood of @xmath16 . 
 it is easy to see that all the data points of @xmath152 are inside a ball @xmath153 of radius @xmath154 . 
 therefore , the out - of - sample extension @xmath43 is also in this ball , namely @xmath155 since @xmath8 is a lipschitz function and @xmath156 , we have @xmath157 by combining eqs . and , we get @xmath158 .    next , we show an identical result for the case where the weights from eq . 
 [ eq : tang weights ] are utilized to construct the covariance matrix @xmath41 . 
 moreover , the approximations of the tangential spaces converge to the correct tangential space as @xmath159 tends to @xmath98 . 
 [ thm : main ] let @xmath72 be a @xmath141-net of @xmath3 and let @xmath145 be a lipschitz function with a constant @xmath146 . if @xmath147 and @xmath148 is computed using the weights in eq . 
 [ eq : tang weights ] , then @xmath160 . 
 let @xmath150 be the @xmath161 neighborhood of @xmath16 . 
 then , the weight matrix becomes @xmath162    by using eq . 
 , we get @xmath163 where the @xmath127 matrices are defined in eq . 
 [ eq : tang weights ] . 
 the structure of the @xmath127 matrices allows us to find a basis in which all the matrices @xmath164 become diagonal . 
 let us denote the diagonal form of @xmath127 by @xmath165 . 
 then @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the transformation matrix . 
 we can rewrite eq . to become @xmath168 since all @xmath165 are diagonal 
 , we get a weighted average of the data points @xmath152 in the new basis , which is known to be in convex hull . 
 thus , it is located inside a ball that contains all the data points . 
 it means that @xmath148 is inside a ball of radius @xmath154 that contains all @xmath152 . 
 therefore , @xmath169 
 recall that the dataset @xmath72 consists of @xmath170 data points and assume that the number of data points in the neighborhood of @xmath16 is @xmath30 . 
 the covariance matrix of a data point @xmath57 from eq . 
 [ eq : cov xj ] is also computed once for each data point in @xmath72 , considering each of its @xmath30 neighbors . 
 the complexity of the neighborhood computation is @xmath171 operations . 
 then , the covariance matrix is computed in @xmath172 operations . 
 thus , the complexity of this pre - computation stage is @xmath173 operations . for each data point , we multiply vectors of size @xmath174 by matrices of size @xmath175 or @xmath176 . thus , the out - of - sample extension complexity is @xmath177 operations . 
 the function @xmath178 \times [ 0,\pi ] \rightarrow \mathbbm{r}^3 $ ] maps the spherical coordinates @xmath179 into a 3-d sphere of radius @xmath180 . 
 more specifically , @xmath181 we generate @xmath182 data points angularly equally distributed where we have @xmath183 data points on each axis as a training dataset . 
 we generate 100 random data points for which we compute the out - of - sample extension . 
 the results from the application of the algorithm using weights as defined in eq . 
 [ eq : simple w ] , are shown in fig . [

 [ fig : sphere_3estimations ] , we can see three different results from an out - of - sample extension using different weights as presented in section [ sec : feature based variance ] . in table 
 [ algorithm_error ] , we show how the results get better for more advanced weight algorithms . 
 we display an accurate error mean for the algorithm .

 [ eq : tang weights ] , but with different estimations for the tangential space at each data point.,width=566 ]      darpa datasets @xcite from 1998 and 1999 are utilized here to find anomalies in them . all the activities and non - activities are labeled and published . these datasets contain different types of cyber attacks that we consider as anomalies . 
 we use this dataset to evaluate the performance of the out - of - sample extension using weights from eq . 
 [ eq : tang weights ] and the mahalanobis distance from eq . 
 [ eq : maha measure ] . the experiment done by following the example in @xcite . 
 we use the same data and same mapping that was developed in @xcite . 
 diffusion maps ( dm ) @xcite , which was applied to darpa data , reduces the dimensionality by embedding @xmath186 to @xmath187 such that @xmath188 . 
 we present two experiments using this data to evaluate the performance of the out - of - sample extension . 
 the first experiment is an out - of - sample extension for non - anomalous data points by comparing the original results from the dm embedding . 
 the second experiment evaluates the anomaly detection of the algorithm .      in this experiment 
 , we use 800 data points and an embedding function @xmath189 that was described before . by taking a random subset @xmath190 of data points and by using the values @xmath191 , we approximate @xmath8 on @xmath185 data from the 800 . 
 we compare the approximated result to the correct values of @xmath8 and measure the error . 
 to evaluate the performance of our method , we compare these results to the results from other leading methods such as the classic nystrm method , the multiscale data sampling and function extension ( mse ) method described in @xcite and the auto - adaptative laplacian pyramids method described in @xcite . 
 to make the presentation self contained , nystrm , mse and auto - adaptative laplacian pyramids methods are outlined next . 
 nystrm method : : :    the nystrm method @xcite is vastly used for an out - of - sample    extension in dimensionality reduction methods . 
 it is a numerical    scheme for the extension of integral operator eigenfunctions . 
 it finds    a numerical approximation for the eigenfunction problem    @xmath192 where @xmath193 is an eigenfunction and    @xmath194 is the corresponding eigenvalue .

 then , eq . [ nys1 ] can be approximated by a quadrature rule    to become @xmath204 . 
 then , the nystrm extension of    @xmath193 to a new data point @xmath205 is    @xmath206 . 
 +    if @xmath196 is symmetric , then its normalized eigenfunctions    @xmath207 constitute an orthonormal    basis to @xmath208 . 
 thus , any vector    @xmath209^t$ ] , ( @xmath210 )    can be decomposed into a superposition of its eigenvectors    @xmath211 . then

 in this paper , we present an efficient out - of - sample extension ( interpolation ) scheme for dimensionality reduction maps that are widely used in the field of data analysis . 
 the computational cost of such maps is high . 
 therefore , once such a map is computed over a training set , an efficient extension scheme is needed . 
 the presented scheme is based on the manifold assumption , which is widely used in the field of dimensionality reduction . 
 it provides an optimal solution from a stochastic geometric - based linear equations system that is determined by the application of local pca of the embedded data . 
 moreover , the scheme enables to detect abnormal data points .

59,"the concept of chiral symmetry breaking in strong interactions goes back to the pioneering work by nambu @xcite , and it has been widely explored and discussed since that time . 
 restoration of chiral symmetry at high densities was proposed by lee and wick @xcite already in 1974 . 
 theoretical procedures for studying chiral symmetry restoration at high temperatures were proposed on the same year by dolan and jackiw @xcite and by weinberg @xcite . 
 qcd at finite temperature and density has attracted much interest . 
 for latest studies of the qcd phase diagram see for instance @xcite . 
 physical applications are to high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite and to the physics of the early universe @xcite . 
 a review of lattice calculations can be found for instance in ref . 
 the nambu - jona - lasinio model has been used under different approximations to obtain indications on the chiral transition ( see for instance @xcite ) . 
 a number of peculiar features may emerge due to the chiral phase transition and recently much attention has been attracted by the possibility of disoriented chiral condensate formation ( see for instance @xcite ) . 
 it is strongly suspected that a single transition occurs rather than separate transitions for deconfinement and chiral - symmetry . 
 we had suggested a heuristic argument indicating that , at least for zero density , the critical temperature for chiral transition , @xmath3 , coincides with that for deconfinement , @xmath4 @xcite . 
 the order parameters usually considered cover extreme and opposite ranges . 
 the thermally averaged polyakov loop is suitable in the limit of infinite quark masses to describe the transition from the confined to the non - confined phase . 
 the other extreme is the limit of vanishing quark masses , where the thermally averaged quark - antiquark bilinears are the typical order parameters for chiral symmetry transition . 
 we shall deal here with the chiral transition , concentrating on the thermally averaged quark bilinears at finite temperatures as order parameters for chirality . for light massive quarks , such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , 
 rigorously , chiral symmetry is already broken in the lagrangian , but we can still retain the notion of phase transition , by looking at the region of @xmath7 where the condensate has a rapid variation . the current quark mass plays a role analogous to that of an external magnetic field in the ferromagnetic transition , as it explicitly violates the chiral symmetry whose restoration characterizes the phase transition 
 .    the analysis will be based on a composite operator formalism at finite temperature . 
 the formalism makes use of an effective action for composite operators @xcite . 
 actually the effective potential admits of a landau expansion around the critical point and thus the behaviour of the condensate is well reconstructed by knowing the coefficients ( which are infrared safe ) and the critical exponents . 
 we shall compare with the results following from a landau expansion and show the general agreement .    within the composite operator formalism 
 we had already discussed the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath8 @xcite , in the whole range of temperatures up to @xmath3 . 
 we shall here mainly deal with the ratio of the scalar to pseudoscalar mass @xmath9 at varying temperature . 
 this ratio has a peculiar theoretical interest as a sensible indicator of the degree of chiral symmetry breaking . 
 let us for the moment neglect the small @xmath5 and @xmath6 quark masses . 
 when chiral symmetry is restored the two mesons are degenerate in mass . 
 the ratio is then equal to unity . at zero temperature instead in the broken chiral phase 
 the pion is a goldstone and has vanishing mass , while the sigma has a finite mass from the chiral condensation . 
 thus one expects the mass ratio to decrease from @xmath10 to one at the chiral transition . 
 quark masses will change this picture quantitatively leading to a decrease from a finite value to a value close to one . 
 beyond some temperature , before approaching the critical value for the transition , the sigma will not have phase space left to decay into two pions . 
 its instability will decrease when increasing the temperature , and the channel into two pions will finally be suppressed at some temperature in the vicinity but lower than the critical temperature . 
 the decay channel into two photons will still be available and become the dominant channel @xcite . 
 it is too early to say whether a possible experimental signature for the transition may be inferred from such behaviour . 
 an accurate determination of the mass ratio versus temperature is in itself of theoretical interest as it constitutes a significant parameter for the degree of chiral symmetry breaking at finite temperature . 
 this we shall do in this note in the composite operator formalism by making use of parameter values obtained from fits to zero temperature qcd . 
 in section 2 we shall summarize the main results of the application of the composite operator formalism in qcd . in section 3 
 we determine the relevant qcd parameters and discuss the hadronic masses at non zero temperature . 
 the temperature dependence of the observables is discussed in section 4 , where we also calculate the temperature at which the sigma can no longer decay via strong interaction . 
 following ref .  @xcite the zero temperature euclidean effective action for an @xmath11 qcd - like gauge theory is @xmath12 - { \rm tr}\left [ { \bf \sigma}{\bf s}\right ] -{\bf \gamma}_2({\bf s } ) + counterterms \label{effact}\ ] ] where @xmath13 , * m * is the bare quark mass matrix and @xmath14 is the sum of all the two - particle irreducible vacuum diagrams with fermionic propagator @xmath15 and @xmath16 . at two - loop level @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the gauge boson propagator , so that @xmath19 , @xmath20 = 2{\bf \gamma}_2 $ ] and one can rewrite eq . 
 ( [ effact ] ) in terms of @xmath21 @xmath22 + { \bf \gamma}_2({\bf \sigma } ) + counterterms\nonumber\\ & = & - { \rm tr}\ln\left[{\bf s}_0^{-1 } -{\bf \sigma } \right ] + { 1\over 
 2}{\rm tr}\left({\bf \sigma}\delta^{-1}{\bf \sigma } \right ) + counterterms \label{effact1}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    here the variable @xmath21 plays the role of a dynamical variable . at the minimum of the functional action , 
 that is when the schwinger - dyson equation is satisfied , @xmath21 is nothing but the fermion self - energy . 
 a parametrization for @xmath21 , employed in @xcite was @xmath23 with a suitable ansatz for @xmath24 , and with * s * and * p * scalar and pseudoscalar constant fields respectively to be taken as the variational parameters . 
 the effective potential one obtains from eq . 
 ( [ effact1 ] ) ( see ref . 
 @xcite ) is @xmath25-\nonumber\\ & & - n~{\rm tr}\ln\left[i\hat{k } - \left({\bf m}+{\bf \sigma}_s \right)-i\gamma_5{\bf \sigma}_p\right ] + \delta z~{\rm tr}({\bf m}~{\bf s } ) \label{effpot}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the quadratic casimir of the fermion representation ( for @xmath27 @xmath28 ) . 
 furthermore @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 gell - mann matrices , @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 is the gauge coupling constant and @xmath37 is the four - dimensional volume . in eq . 
 ( [ effpot ] ) @xmath38 has a divergent part to compensate the leading divergence proportional to @xmath39 in the logarithmic term . 
 we remark that both the current mass * m * and the self - energy @xmath21 are , in general , matrices in flavour space . 
 however , as discussed in refs . 
 @xcite if we neglect the mixing between different flavours originating , for instance , from terms such as the t hooft determinant @xcite , it follows that only the flavour diagonal elements of the fermion self - energy and mass can be different from zero at the minimum . with vanishing off - diagonal terms 
 , the effective potential decomposes into the sum of @xmath40 contributions ( @xmath40  =  number of flavours ) , one for each flavour . 
 therefore , to study the minima of the effective potential , it is formally sufficient to consider a single contribution . of course 
 , the choice of a given flavour number will reflect in the particular parameters assumed . in the present paper , as in ref.@xcite 
 , we will take @xmath41 and a number of colour @xmath42 . 
 the value of the parameters will be specified later on .    as far as the choice for the function @xmath24 is concerned , in qcd , the operator product expansion suggests ( neglecting logarithmic corrections ) to take for @xmath24 a momentum behaviour as @xmath43 for large @xmath44 . 
 we have chosen as a variational ansatz @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a momentum scale which is expected to be of the order of @xmath47 .    to extend the zero - temperature theory to finite temperature we can still work with continuous energies by substituting for the sum over discrete energies @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 ) a sum of integrals over continuous energies by means of the poisson s formula @xcite @xmath50    this substitution corresponds to the imaginary - time formalism after using the poisson s formula and allows for an equivalent version af the dolan - jackiw finite temperature feynman rules @xcite .    in conclusion 
 the final form for the effective potential , for a quark of mass @xmath51 , is ( see ref . 
 @xcite ) @xmath52-\nonumber\\ & & - 2n~\sum_{n=-\infty}^{n=+\infty}~(-)^{n}~\int{d^{4}k\over ( 2\pi)^{4}}~ \ln\left[k^2 + \left(m + \sigma_s\right)^2+\sigma^{2}_{p}\right ] + \delta z~ms \label{effpot1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 . 
 let us now comment on the choice for the gauge coupling constant . as suggested by asymptotic freedom and renormalization - group considerations , we expect the strong forces to weaken at high temperature @xcite . 
 we shall then assume that in the uv region the coupling constant @xmath55 depends logarithmically on the temperature @xmath7 . 
 we take into account this assumption by writing @xmath56 where @xmath57 and we will discuss the parameters @xmath58 , @xmath46 and @xmath59 later on .    at @xmath60 the effective potential does not acquire any extra divergence with respect to the @xmath61 case . 
 the renormalization at @xmath61 can be performed by adding a counterterm and requiring that the derivative of the effective potential with respect to the term which breaks explicitly the chiral symmetry , evaluated at the minimum , satisfies for each flavour the renormalization condition @xcite @xmath62 the fermion condensate @xmath63 is related to the minimum @xmath64 of the effective potential , renormalized at the scale @xmath46 through the relation ( see ref . 
 @xcite ) @xmath65 and @xmath66 . 
 at finite @xmath7 we do not have any additional divergence with respect to the @xmath61 case ; nevertheless , in order to satisfy the generalization of the normalization condition ( [ normcond ] ) at finite @xmath7 we have to add a finite counterterm to that determined at @xmath61 @xcite . finally we recall that with the appropriate normalization for the pion field ( see next section ) , eq . 
 ( [ normcond ] ) and its generalization at finite @xmath7 is also equivalent to the adler - dashen formula @xmath67 
 to compute the masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively ) one has to take the second derivative of the effective potential ( [ effpot1 ] ) with respect to the scalar field @xmath70 and the pseudoscalar field @xmath71 , evaluated at the minimum ( for the sake of simplicity we are assuming that the up and down quarks are degenerate in mass and @xmath72 in eq . 
 ( [ effpot1 ] ) ) . 
 the actual values of the masses will be obtained by multiplying the second derivative by the appropriate factor @xmath73 that relates the physical fields @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) to @xmath71 ( @xmath70 ) according to @xmath76 . 
 this factor can be obtained in terms of the decay constant @xmath77 through standard arguments of current algebra @xcite . 
 one gets @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the extremum of the effective potential in the presence of a bare mass .    to derive a more physically transparent expression for the masses of the mesons as expressed by eq . 
 ( [ masses ] ) through the second derivative of the effective potential , we will use the gap equation and the generalization at finite @xmath7 of the normalization condition ( [ normcond ] ) . the extremum condition is @xmath80 } ~e^{\displaystyle{in\beta k_{0}}}\right]+~m~\delta z=0 \label{extrcond}\\ { \partial v\over \partial p}=0 \rightarrow   { \bar p}=0 \label{extrcond1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath81 . 
 as far as the normalization condition is concerned , by using the relation ( [ condenst ] ) between the scalar field at the minimum and the scalar condensate we shall write in general @xmath82 \label{deltaz}\ ] ] with @xmath83 and where @xmath84 is the minimum of the effective potential in the massless case . 
 now , by using the gap equations ( [ extrcond])-([extrcond1 ] ) and the normalization condition ( [ deltaz ] ) in the explicit expressions ( [ masses ] ) for the meson masses , we can eliminate @xmath38 and @xmath85 to finally obtain , for a quark of mass @xmath51 : @xmath86 ~e^{\displaystyle{in\beta k_{0 } } } \label{emmepai2}\ ] ] @xmath87^{2 } } ~e^{\displaystyle{in\beta k_{0 } } } \label{emmesig2}\ ] ]    we notice that eq . 
 ( [ emmepai2 ] ) reproduces , in the small mass limit , the adler - dashen formula ( [ adash ] ) and differs from this formula only by terms of order @xmath88 .    in order to fix the values of the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 
 we follow the same procedure of ref .  @xcite . in the massive case 
 the effective potential is uv divergent and from the normalization condition ( in the small - mass limit ) and gap equation one is able to fix , through a self - consistency relation , the values @xmath91 . by inserting this value in the gap equation for massless quarks , 
 one finds that chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken ( at @xmath61 ) via a minimum of @xmath92 located at @xmath93 and the point @xmath94 is a local maximum . to determine the mass scale @xmath46 and the quark masses from the experimental data 
 , one has to derive the explicit expressions for the masses and for the decay constants of the pseudoscalar octet mesons which are the pseudo - goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking . 
 these expressions constitute a system of coupled equations which we have solved by an approximation method . 
 the experimental inputs are the decay constant and mass of the charged pion , the charged kaon mass and the electromagnetic mass difference between the neutral and the charged kaon . 
 the outputs of the numerical fit for the octet meson masses ( agreement within 3% ) are the masses of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath70 quarks and the mass parameter @xmath46 . 
 the values we get are the following @xcite @xmath95 finally , the parameter @xmath59 , which appears in the expression ( [ coupling ] ) for the running coupling constant , has to be determined on phenomenological grounds . if we compare our model in the low-@xmath7 regime with the results of ref . 
 @xcite we find @xmath96 for @xmath40 flavours , which gives @xmath97 for @xmath41 @xcite .    with these values for the relevant parameters it is easy to determine the masses of the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons at @xmath61 ( we are using the value @xmath98 for the pion decay constant ) @xmath99 and ( again at @xmath61 ) the fermionic condensates at @xmath46 for massless and massive quarks @xmath100 the value we have obtained for the mass of the scalar meson , @xmath101 , accords very well with those obtained by other authors within different approaches to the study of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in qcd @xcite . 
 it is well known that as the temperature @xmath7 increases we expect some changes in the hadronic properties of matter as a consequence of a possible phase transition . 
 for instance , a physical quantity as @xmath8 will decrease as @xmath7 increases @xcite . 
 this means that the pion tends to decouple from matter ( quarks and leptons ) as @xmath7 increases . 
 as far as the pion mass is concerned , @xmath103 has a weak dependence on the temperature . 
 in fact the value of @xmath103 is dominated by the current quark mass for temperatures below the critical value , whereas it becomes independent of @xmath51 at the critical temperature or above it . 
 this should be expected because , for @xmath104 , the pion becomes an ordinary resonance and its mass is dominated by @xmath47 and not by @xmath51 . 
 this is a clear sign that the pion loses its goldstone nature once the approximate chiral symmetry is restored @xcite . 
 the scalar meson mass @xmath105 will decrease in association with partial chiral symmetry restoration in hot matter . 
 in fact the scalar @xmath68 meson can be described as a @xmath106 quasi bound state and its mass is about twice the constituent quark mass @xcite . 
 thus the @xmath68-mass will decrease substantially with increasing temperature and this behaviour is mainly determined by the @xmath7-dependence of the constituent quark mass . 
 the decreasing of the @xmath68-mass is expected from the restoration of chiral symmetry at @xmath107 . 
 in fact @xmath108 for @xmath109 at @xmath107 . as a consequence @xmath105 will become smaller than @xmath110 at some temperature @xmath111 and the @xmath68-meson , which has a large width at @xmath61 due to the decay @xmath112 , would appear as a sharp resonance at high temperature since the amplitude for @xmath112 would vanish above @xmath0 ( near the critical point of the chiral phase transition ) . thus one can expect to have a better chance of seeing the @xmath68-meson emerge as a clear , narrow state at non zero temperature . 
 in fact , since for @xmath113 the decay width of @xmath68 by strong interaction vanishes , only the electromagnetic width coming from @xmath114 is left @xcite .    within our model 
 we are able to make some rough estimate of the temperature @xmath0 at which this phenomenon takes place by simply studying the behaviour of the meson masses ( [ emmepai2 ] ) , ( [ emmesig2 ] ) as a function of the temperature . however , since we are , as already said , mainly interested in determining the temperature @xmath0 at which @xmath1 , instead of evaluating separately @xmath105 and @xmath103 it will be sufficient to study the ratio @xmath115 @xmath116^{2}}~{\bar \sigma}_{s}^{2 } ~e^{\displaystyle{in\beta k_{0 } } } } \over\displaystyle { \langle{\bar\psi}\psi\rangle_t~-12~ { \sum_{n}(-)^{n}\int { d^{4}k\over ( 2\pi)^{4 } } \left[{{\bar \sigma}_{s}\over k^{2}+\left(m+{\bar \sigma}_{s}\right)^{2 } } ~-~{{\bar s}\over   s_{0}}~ { \sigma_{0s}\over k^{2}+\sigma^2_{0s}}\right]}~ e^{\displaystyle{in\beta k_{0 } } } } } \label{ratiosq}\ ] ] by straightforward calculations at the leading order in @xmath117 we obtain @xmath118^{2 } } \label{ratiosq1}\ ] ] furthermore , as we expect that the temperature @xmath0 will be not far from the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition , we can start our investigation by performing a mean - field expansion _ 
 a - la _ landau of the effective potential in the small quark - mass limit around the critical point . 
 following ref . 
 @xcite we have @xmath119 \label{landau}\ ] ] where @xmath120 . 
 if we now compute the masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons from the expression ( [ landau ] ) of the effective potential we get @xmath121 by noticing that the generalization at finite @xmath7 of the normalization condition ( [ normcond ] ) on the effective potential reads now @xmath122 and that the coefficient @xmath123 is given by the expression ( see ref . 
 @xcite ) @xmath124^{2 } } ~e^{\displaystyle{in\beta m y_{0 } } } \label{aquattro}\ ] ] it is easy to check that eq . 
 ( [ landmasratio ] ) is nothing but eq . 
 ( [ ratiosq1 ] ) . 
 just to have a rough idea of the value of the temperature @xmath0 we can push our approximation further by evaluating @xmath123 and @xmath125 at @xmath126 and using for @xmath127 the expression for the massless minimum around @xmath126 @xcite @xmath128 in eq . 
 ( [ landmasratio ] ) . 
 the numerical values for the coefficients relevant for the evaluation of the mass ratio are @xmath129 and @xmath130 @xcite .    by now imposing the condition 
 @xmath131 we have a constraint on the temperature ratio @xmath132 @xmath133 and this constraint fixes @xmath134 . 
 the approximations we have made up to now ( we have evaluated @xmath123 and @xmath125 at @xmath126 , and we have chosen for @xmath127 the behaviour as given by eq . 
 ( [ essezerot ] ) ) allow us to study @xmath9 only for @xmath7 very close to @xmath126 . to study the mass ratio @xmath9 as a function of @xmath7 for all the values of the temperature from @xmath61 up to @xmath7 very close to @xmath126 we have to go back to eq.([ratiosq1 ] ) which is valid for any @xmath7 at the leading order in the quark mass @xmath51 . to evaluate @xmath135 
 we can perform the integration in @xmath136 by using the cauchy theorem and summing up the series ; then , through a numerical calculation we can finally perform the integration left . in fig . 
 [ fig1 ] we plot the mass ratio @xmath9 as a function of @xmath7 for a mass @xmath137 ; from the numerical analysis we can evaluate again the temperature @xmath0 @xmath138 and this constraint now fixes @xmath139 . 
 we remark that this result for @xmath0 is in complete agreement with that previously derived by studying the landau expansion of the effective potential for @xmath7 very close to @xmath126 . finally , if one wants to study @xmath140 including all the orders in the quark mass @xmath51 and for any temperature it is necessary to go back to the general formula ( [ ratiosq ] ) . in fig . 
 [ fig2 ] it is plotted the behaviour of the mass ratio as a function of @xmath7 as derived by the explicit evaluation of eq . 
 ( [ ratiosq ] ) . in this case 
 the temperature @xmath0 we are looking for is determined again by the condition @xmath141 which fixes @xmath142 . 
 curiously this result exactly coincides with that obtained through the landau expansion and the evaluation of the coefficients @xmath123 , @xmath125 at @xmath126 and by putting for @xmath84 the expression ( [ essezerot ] ) as suggested by the mean - field theory . 
 we have applied the composite operator formalism to qcd at finite temperature . after carrying out consistently the renormalization in the effective potential , we have calculated the masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons . 
 the relevant qcd parameters have been derived from the expressions for the masses and decay constants of the pseudoscalar multiplet , by inserting as inputs the mass and decay constant of the pion , the charged kaon mass and the electromagnetic mass difference between neutral and charged kaon .    a main purpose of the calculation was to determine the temperature @xmath0 at which @xmath1 . 
 such temperature will be reached before the critical point , since the scalar meson mass @xmath105 is expected to decrease along with partial chiral symmetry restoration in hot matter , and at the same time the pion will lose its goldstone nature.the temperature @xmath0 is also expected not to lie far from the critical temperature of the chiral transition . in principle the @xmath68-meson would appear as a narrow state at high enough temperature . for @xmath113 
 its partial width by strong interaction has to vanish . 
 the result of our calculation gives @xmath2 , in an approximation including current quark masses and with the full effective potential given by the formalism . 
 we find that this result almost coincides with a much simpler treatment using a mean - field expansion of the effective potential _ a - la _ landau around the critical point in the limit of small quark mass . 
 it is perhaps premature to discuss whether a possible experimental signature for the qcd phase transition may be inferred from the behaviour of the sigma width . 
 the mass ratio itself is in any case a significant parameter to describe the degree of chiral symmetry breaking at different temperatures and therefore it has to be considered as a quantity of intrinsic theoretical interest .

60,"quantum dots , their current and noise properties @xcite are widely investigated topics in today s nanophysics with a number of possible applications , the most revolutionary being a spin - based quantum computer @xcite . here 
 , the spin of an electron in a quantum dot is used as a qubit , which serves as the basic building block of a quantum computer . a necessary ingredient for quantum processing 
 is the possibility to couple at least two qubits and to understand and manipulate the various correlations . 
 this is one of the motivations to study double quantum dots @xcite . 
 in particular , it is required to create entangled electron states by the interaction of an electron inside the double dot with an electron tunneling onto the double dot . measuring this entanglement is an important experimental task and theoretical suggestions how to probe 
 these states are needed .    in this work 
 , we will discuss the relation between zero - frequency current noise , coulomb correlations , and entanglement for the example of a double quantum dot . 
 we will make use of the recent observation @xcite that noise measurements in the nonlinear coulomb - blockade regime can be used to obtain spectroscopic information of excited levels in a quantum dot . 
 this scheme will be adapted to a double quantum dot and we will show that the important interaction parameter @xmath0 ( containing information about the entanglement )  @xcite enters the fano factor ( i.e. , the ratio of noise power to current ) in this regime . 
 this kind of noise spectroscopy can be used to directly extract @xmath0 from experimentally observable quantities . 
 we extend a previous discussion @xcite of the low - frequency shot noise of a double - dot system by an analysis of the full counting statistics of the transferred charge . 
 this allows us to identify directly the interaction parameter by a noise measurement . 
 one main result is obtained in the transport regime , in which predominantly only one electron occupies the lowest double dot level due to the coulomb interaction . 
 thermal activation leads to tunneling events through excited two - electron states which result ( under the conditions discussed below ) in super - poissonian shot noise characterized by a fano factor @xmath1 hence , a measurement of the noise in this regime allows a direct determination of the interaction parameter @xmath0 . 
 we now turn to a description of the model and the method . with 
 maximally two electrons occupying the double dot and no magnetic field lifting the spin - degeneracy , the following hund - mulliken eigenstates of the double quantum dot are possible ( for a more detailed description see @xcite ) : the zero - electron state @xmath2 , two two - fold degenerate one - electron states @xmath3 ( symmetric ) and @xmath4 ( anti - symmetric ) , four two - electron states with one electron per dot , the singlet @xmath5 and the three - fold degenerate triplet @xmath6 . 
 there are two other singlet states that have a significantly higher energy due to the large on - site coulomb interaction which do not have a physical effect in the regime studied ( but are included in the numerical calculations ) . 
 we consider a ( longitudinal ) double dot coupled to leads , which are modeled as a fermi sea . 
 the tunnel coupling leads to a tunneling amplitude @xmath7 , which measures the overlap between the orbital state and the lead wave function in terminal @xmath8 . 
 we assume that @xmath9 is the applied bias voltage and that @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are the chemical potentials of the left and right leads . 
 there is an additional lead with capacitive coupling to the double dot characterized by the gate voltage @xmath12 that shifts the potential on the dot . 
 when one electron is on the dot , it can be in two possible states : its wave function is spread either symmetrically or anti - symmetrically over the two dots . 
 the symmetric state has a lower eigenenergy , and the energy difference between the two one - electron states depends on the interdot tunneling amplitude @xmath13 , describing the potential barrier between the two dots . including the energy contribution of the gate voltage , the eigenenergies of these states can be calculated as @xmath14 . 
 adding a second electron , we have first to overcome the gate voltage again , and additionally the repulsive coulomb interaction between the two electrons leads to a spin - dependent splitting of the eigenenergies . for the singlet state @xmath5 we obtain the energy @xmath15 , and for the ( three - fold degenerate ) 
 triplet state @xmath16 the energy @xmath17 . here 
 , @xmath18 is the ( inter - dot ) electron - electron repulsion and @xmath19 is the heisenberg exchange parameter that characterizes the heisenberg interaction between the two spins , @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the on - site coulomb repulsion . because @xmath22 is positive 
 , the singlet state has a lower energy than the triplet state . 
 the singlet state can be expressed in terms of the creation operators @xmath23 , @xmath24 , which create an ( anti)-symmetric electron state @xmath25 the interaction parameter @xmath0 describes the competition between the kinetic - energy gain and the coulomb repulsion . in the hund - mulliken model @xmath26 
 is determined by the inter - dot tunneling amplitude @xmath13 and the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath21 @xcite . in general 
 , the dependence of @xmath0 on the microscopic parameters may have a different form , however we will always use this definition for the quantitative plots below . 
 it is important to stress that the results obtained below are largely independent on the precise dependence of @xmath0 on the details of the quantum dot . 
 hence , the noise features we find can be used as an additional test of the applicability of the model calculation of ref . 
 @xcite to realistic quantum dots . 
 we describe transport through the double dot in the sequential - tunneling approximation using the master equation @xmath27 here , @xmath28 and @xmath29 label the available states of the quantum dot , including the number of electrons on the dot , the orbital index , and the spin . 
 @xmath30 is the occupation probability of state @xmath28 , and @xmath31 is the tunneling rate from state @xmath28 to state @xmath29 . 
 the rates are given by @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the bare tunneling rate to the left ( right ) terminal , and @xmath34 is the density of states in the leads . 
 the matrix elements @xmath35 depend on the orbital and the spin state of the dot @xcite . 
 the occupation in the leads is determined by the fermi functions @xmath36 $ ] , the direction of tunneling is defined by @xmath37 and the energy difference by @xmath38 . 
 we note here , that the interaction parameter @xmath0 enters the calculations through the matrix elements @xmath35 of the singlet state . for a more detailed discussion of these tunneling rates 
 we refer to @xcite . for later use 
 we express the master equation  ( [ emasteq ] ) in matrix form , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    from the master equation , we obtain the noise @xcite . 
 the quantity characterizing the current noise is the fano factor @xmath43 . 
 it measures , how far the distribution of the tunneling events differ from the random , poissonian distribution : for poissonian noise , when the tunneling events are uncorrelated , @xmath44 . 
 a fano factor @xmath45 can be due to anti - correlations ( e.g. the pauli principle ) 
 . we will be mostly interested below in super - poissonian noise , @xmath46 , and we will show that here it is due to correlated transport cycles resulting from a blockade of open channels . by a transport cycle 
 we mean the following process @xcite : suppose the system is initially in its ground state @xmath47 , and another state @xmath48 ( which would be available for tunneling according to its energy ) is blocked due to coulomb interaction . 
 when this electron in @xmath47 tunnels out of the dot due to a thermal excitation , both the states @xmath47 and @xmath48 are available for electrons to tunnel into . 
 a cycle is occurring , when a sequence of electrons tunnels through state @xmath48 before an electron enters the ground state @xmath47 and blocks the transport through the dot again . 
 this cycle leads to a correlated transfer of a number of charges given by the number electrons tunneling through the excited state @xmath48 . 
 hence , that effective charge transferred in one cycle is larger than one and leads to an increased fano factor . 
 the above picture is based on the sequential - tunneling approximation . 
 the parameters have to be chosen such that cotunneling processes can be neglected . 
 this is experimentally possible , since the current due to cotunneling processes is generally of the order of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the tunneling amplitude and @xmath51 is the excitation energy in the virtual intermediate state . in our case 
 the current in the most interesting regime is proportional to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is exponentially small in @xmath54 . 
 since the tunneling amplitude @xmath50 can in principle be made arbitrarily small , sequential tunneling becomes the dominant process . 
 recently it was shown that noise spectroscopy deep inside the coulomb blockade regime is possible @xcite and in agreement with the sequential - tunneling description . 
 the results of our calculation are summarized in fig . 
 [ fbloccurfan ] , which shows the average current ( top panel ) and the fano factor ( bottom panel ) as a function of the bias voltage @xmath9 and the gate voltage @xmath12 . considering the current , the most visible feature is the coulomb blockade diamond ( green in fig . 
 [ fbloccurfan ] ) . as long as the bias voltage is lower than the energy difference between the energetically lowest state and the next state with one electron more or less , 
 i.e. , @xmath55 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being two states differing by one electron , electron tunneling is exponentially suppressed . in our model 
 , we have three such blockade regimes with 0 , 1 , and 2 electrons in the dot for zero bias voltage . 
 the two parts of fig . 
 [ fbloccurfan ] show the current and the fano factor for the most interesting of these blockade regions , the one - electron blockade regime . 
 we will concentrate our discussion on this region , since most interesting features can be discussed here . 
 we first look at the energies of the states in the blockade regime as a function of the gate voltage , see fig . 
 [ fenplot ] . 
 the capital letters in figs . 
 [ fbloccurfan ] and  [ fenplot ] correspond to these blockade regions , and we will now show that the features in the fano factor can be explained by the energy plot for the states in this region . 
 we first consider the regions @xmath47 . 
 they are both characterized by a fano factor @xmath44 , typical tunneling processes through a simple two - level system . 
 indeed , fig . 
 [ fenplot ] shows that the first excited states differ in electron number . in @xmath56 the excited state 
 is @xmath2 and in @xmath57 @xmath5 . 
 lowering the gate voltage , we come to region @xmath48 , where the first excited state is the state @xmath4 , i.e. , a state with one electron as well . thus , the description in terms of a single state , which can be occupied or not , does not hold any more , and we observe an increase in the fano factor to @xmath58 . in this region , 
 the state @xmath2 is still the first state available for tunneling , but the blocked state @xmath4 is energetically lower . continuing to region @xmath59 , 
 in which the energies of the two - electron states become lower than the zero - electron state . 
 so the first available excited state is the singlet @xmath5 . 
 the difference between the regions @xmath59 and @xmath60 is somewhat more complicated . 
 since the difference @xmath61 is smaller than @xmath62 , the state @xmath3 still blocks the dot , if it is occupied . after a thermal excitation to the state @xmath5 , 
 electrons tunnel through the states @xmath5 and @xmath4 until an electron occupies the state @xmath3 again and blocks the dot . in the regions @xmath59 and @xmath60 the fano factor depends on the parameter @xmath0 through the prefactor of the singlet states ( see eq .  ) . 
 the @xmath0-dependence is illustrated in fig . 
 [ fphidep ] by varying the parameter @xmath63 . 
 as can be seen the positions of the steps change simultaneously with the plateau height . 
 however , the height depends only on the interaction parameter , as we have checked by numerically varying @xmath21 and @xmath0 independently . 
 we will derive below analytic expressions for the fano factor , which confirm this behavior . 
 the effect of temperature will be to wash out the sharp steps and plateaus . 
 this is illustrated in fig . 
 [ fig : temp ] . 
 increasing the temperature to a value of the order of the level splitting first the sharp steps are washed out . 
 the plateaus c and d , however , remains still visible and the values are still given , at least approximately , by the low temperature results . 
 finally , the temperature leads to a vanishing of the plateaus , which make it difficult to extract the interaction parameter @xmath0 from the fano factor . 
 a more detailed view of the transport characteristic can be obtained by looking at the full counting statistics ( fcs ) @xcite . 
 the aim is here to find the cumulant generating function ( cgf ) @xmath64 , which is related to the probability @xmath65 of @xmath66 charges passing through the system during the measurement time @xmath67 by @xmath68 . 
 the knowledge of @xmath64 is equivalent to the knowledge of all the cumulants of the system according to @xmath69 , such as current ( first cumulant ) and noise ( second cumulant ) , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively ( where @xmath72 is the electron charge ) . 
 the simplest way to evaluate the counting statistics in this case is to use the method described in ref .  . 
 we choose ( without loss of generality ) to count the charges in the left lead . 
 therefore , we have to change the left tunneling rates in the off - diagonal elements of the transport matrix @xmath73 : @xmath74 . 
 the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath73 , which we denote by @xmath75 , determines the cgf as @xmath76 . 
 if we restrict our calculations to a certain region and thus reduce the number of involved states , it is possible to get an analytical expression for the fano factor @xcite . for region @xmath59 , we include the one - electron states @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and the two - electron singlet @xmath5 . here , the relevant energy differences are both smaller than the bias : @xmath77 . 
 therefore both fermi functions for the tunneling processes are exponentially suppressed , but one is much bigger than the other : @xmath78 therefore , we neglect @xmath79 and take the rates to lowest order in the parameter @xmath80 . then the tunneling rates are @xmath81 here , @xmath82 are the bare tunneling rates for the left / right leads . without loss of generality , we will count the charges in the left lead , which means , we have to replace @xmath83 ( the sign depending on whether an electron enters or leaves the dot respectively ) in the off - diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath73 . 
 the counting statistics is obtained from the smallest eigenvalue @xmath84 , which we determine to lowest order in @xmath53 . 
 the result is @xmath85 where @xmath86 $ ] . 
 finally we obtain the fano factor @xmath87 which is independent of the bias voltage as long as we are in the one - electron coulomb blockade regime . for a symmetric structure with @xmath88 
 we obtain eq . 
 ( [ efanc ] ) .    a similar result may be obtained for the region @xmath60 in fig . 
 [ fbloccurfan ] . here 
 , the situation is a bit more complicated , since the lowest - lying triplet state also plays a role and , thus , the problem involves four states . in the same way as before we neglect @xmath89 
 since the transition between @xmath90 is the least suppressed . 
 assuming that the temperature is much smaller than the singlet - triplet splitting , we calculate the series expansion for the fano factor ( with symmetric leads ) to be @xmath91 both these results , eqs . 
 ( [ efanc ] ) and ( [ efand ] ) , are in agreement with our numerical calculations as shown in fig . 
 [ fphidep ] . 
 in conclusion , we have shown that noise measurements in the coulomb blockade regime of a double quantum dot can reveal interesting information about the quantum correlations created during tunneling . 
 in particular , we have shown that the fano factor in the one - electron blockade region is super - poissonian and can be used to determine the interaction parameter @xmath0 . 
 this allows to measure the degree of entanglement of two electrons in the double quantum dot .

61,"the use of general principles to investigate systems whose microscopic makeup is unclear can be very rewarding . 
 sometimes this method gives information on a whole class of systems . among such principles , thermodynamics , 
 believed to be of universal applicability , stands out . 
 an instructive example of its use is the application of the second law of thermodynamics to the problem of viscous flow , for which it permits the inference that the two viscosity coefficients must be positive without need to resort to microscopic expressions for the latter  @xcite .    in this work 
 we use the generalization of the second law of thermodynamics holding in the presence of black holes ( the generalized second law  gsl ) to reach further conclusions about the shear viscosity coefficient of an arbitrary fluid . 
 we do this by describing a new paradox for ideal fluid flow in the presence of a black hole . 
 this indicates that the correlation length of a real fluid can not be arbitrarily small . by implication the energy - momentum tensors 
 describing systems which display macroscopic fluid behavior must be subject to a restriction : the shear viscosity , a function of the thermodynamic state of the system , can not be arbitrarily small . 
 thereby the gsl opens an alternative macroscopic approach to the recently proposed lower bound on viscosity  @xcite . 
 the gsl is a unique law of physics that bridges thermodynamics and gravity . 
 it is rooted in the understanding that a black hole , basically a pure gravity entity , is endowed with well defined entropy  @xcite proportional to its surface area . 
 the gsl  @xcite then claims that the sum of the entropy of all black holes and the total ordinary entropy in the black holes exterior never decreases . 
 while this formulation is reminiscent of the ordinary second law , the gsl is exceptional in that it relates ordinary entropy  a rather elusive object from the mechanical viewpoint  and the surface area of the black hole ( formally the area of its horizon ) whose evolution is quite mechanical in nature . from this point of view 
 it is little surprise that the gsl has provided unexpected information on entropy . 
 an example is the upper bound on the entropy of weakly self - gravitating thermodynamic systems ( the universal bound on entropy  ube  @xcite ) . 
 while in particular cases the bound can be verified directly , it is the gsl which really makes understanding of the bound in generic situations easy . 
 however , the gsl gives more than just a simpler way to see some results derivable by other means . at the microscopic level the gsl represents a piece of the yet to be established theory of quantum gravity . 
 in particular , this law permits , in principle , to draw conclusions that from the microscopic viewpoint would only be derivable from a fundamental theory combining quantum mechanics with gravity . 
 for example , the gsl gives an indication of the number of particle species in nature  @xcite . 
 in another example , the gsl reveals an _ a priori _ bound on the strength of the electromagnetic interaction  @xcite . 
 let us now describe the ideal fluid paradox revealed by invoking the gsl . 
 we assume the existence of physical fluids with arbitrarily small shear viscosity @xmath0 at fixed values of some two thermodynamic variables , say the entropy and the energy densities , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . 
 ( in this work we consider only simple fluids , so the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 completely determine the thermodynamic state of the system . ) here  physical "" means , among other things , that the fluid satisfies the gsl ; this could , in principle , be checked by considering the fluid at the microscopic level , but we shall not go into such detail . 
 the assumption that the fluid has arbitrarily small viscosity allows us to describe its flow as ideal fluid flow , possibly with shocks ( the zero viscosity limit of a given flow can be non - trivial ; see refs . 
 it turns out , as we shall show , that for sufficiently slow accretion of the fluid onto the black hole the overall entropy decreases and the gsl is violated . 
 the realizability , in principle , of such slow accretion flows will be demonstrated , so that the small viscosity assumption engenders a paradox .    of course 
 , ideal fluid paradoxa exist already in non - relativistic physics , for example , the famous dalembert paradox . 
 this maintains that an ideal fluid with no boundaries exerts no force whatsoever on a body moving through it with constant velocity . 
 in particular , there is no lift force , so swimming or flying would be impossible in such a fluid . 
 thus the established fact that swimming is possible in any fluid implies that every real fluid must have nonzero viscosity . 
 there is however an essential difference between the dalembert paradox and the paradox described in this work . 
 dalembert s paradox says nothing about the actual magnitude of @xmath0 . in contrast , our paradox implies , as we shall see , the existence of a lower bound on @xmath0 for given @xmath1 and @xmath2 . 
 this conclusion is in concord with the recent ingenious conjecture of kovtun , starinets and son ( kss )   @xcite ( see also ref . 
 @xcite ) . based on holographic calculations of the viscosity coefficient for certain 
 strongly coupled quantum field theories with gravity duals , they suggested that the viscosity @xmath0 of a general , possibly non - relativistic , fluid is subject to the universal restriction @xmath3 currently this bound is considered a conjecture well supported for a certain class of field theories  see the detailed discussion in ref . 
 @xcite and the references therein . in the sequel 
 we discuss the relation between the ideal fluid paradox presented in the next section and the kss bound . 
 we also argue that a frequent objection to the validity of the kss bound is likely to be ruled out by the gsl . 
 our paper is structured as follows . in sec . 
 [ paradx ] we show explicitly that the slow accretion of a truly ideal fluid onto a schwarzschild black hole leads to a contradiction with the gsl . 
 one escapes from the paradox by recognizing that every fluid must have a nonvanishing correlation length which restricts the range of applicability of the ideal fluid paradigm . in sec . 
 [ kssp ] we obtain a lower bound on the correlation length and a generic estimate of the viscosity of real fluids , which together bound the viscosity to entropy density ratio from below . although this is not yet the kss bound , we consider there the connection between it and the ube , and argue that the gsl provides a natural frame for elucidation of the origin of the former . in the sec . 
 [ summary ] we summarize our results and arguments . 
 the realizability , in principle , of the slow accretion flow assumed in sec . 
 [ paradx ] is demonstrated in the appendix .    unless otherwise stated , we work in units with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is speed of light and @xmath6 is boltzmann s constant . 
 our metric signature is @xmath7 . 
 in the present section we consider ideal fluid flow into a spherical black hole . for some flows , 
 we demonstrate that it is possible for the gsl to be violated so that the total entropy of the system decreases . 
 it follows that the assumption of a perfect continuum down to an arbitrarily small scale is not consistent with the gsl . 
 consider a flow , not necessarily spherically symmetric , in which fluid is absorbed by the black hole . 
 the rate of change of the total entropy @xmath8 of the system is the sum of the rate of change of the entropy of the black hole exterior , @xmath9 , and that of the black hole entropy @xmath10 : @xmath11 here and below we use schwarzschild coordinates @xmath12 , with @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the schwarzschild radius . 
 we first calculate @xmath15 . 
 let the fluid s proper entropy density be @xmath1 . 
 since the fluid is assumed ideal , there is no dissipative contribution to the entropy current density which is thus purely convective , and must take the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the fluid four - velocity . 
 the fluid can carry entropy into the hole leading to a decrease of @xmath9 . 
 the explicit expression for this comes from the entropy balance equation  @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 stands for the determinant of the schwarzschild metric @xmath20 . 
 @xmath15 of the black hole exterior ( @xmath21 ) is thus @xmath22 we have not included a contribution from the outer boundary of the domain of integration because we intend to specialize to stationary flows . in any such situation the entropy flow into the hole per unit @xmath23-time is given by the r.h.s . of eq . 
 ( [ exterior ] ) . 
 the expression is non - positive because @xmath24 for infalling matter . 
 we have assumed that the flow is differentiable , and that it contains no shocks ; otherwise there exists an additional contribution to @xmath15 associated with the entropy generation in the shocks  @xcite . 
 let us now consider the second term of the r.h.s . in eq . 
 ( [ total ] ) . 
 the absorption of the fluid by the black hole increases the latter s mass @xmath25 , producing an increase in the black hole entropy given through energy conservation by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the black hole temperature , and @xmath25 is its mass . 
 we shall now write down the flux of energy into the black hole . 
 let @xmath28 be the killing vector associated with the stationarity of the black hole . 
 then the energy - momentum tensor of the fluid , @xmath29 , must obey @xmath30 or equivalently @xmath31 since @xmath32 is _ minus _ the energy density of the fluid , @xmath33    the energy - momentum tensor of the ideal fluid is given by @xmath34 where @xmath2 is the energy density and @xmath35 is the pressure in the comoving frame . 
 consider now the normalization condition @xmath36 , written as @xmath37.\ ] ] since @xmath38 and @xmath39 are physical velocity components , they should be bounded at @xmath40 . 
 hence since @xmath41 is future and inwardly pointed , and @xmath42 as @xmath43 , we can infer from the last equation that @xmath44 at the horizon . combining all the above we find @xmath45 thus @xmath46 in harmony with hawking s area theorem  @xcite . 
 we observe from eqs . 
 ( [ exterior ] ) and  ( [ black ] ) that while the ( negative ) rate of change of @xmath9 is proportional to the first power of @xmath47 , the ( positive ) rate of change of the black hole entropy is proportional to the _ second _ power of @xmath47 . 
 thus for sufficiently small @xmath48 , the total entropy of the system will _ decrease _ , in violation of the gsl . 
 explicitly we have @xmath49,\ ] ] where we stress that at the horizon @xmath47 is never positive . 
 we observe that when the accretion velocity @xmath50 ( the suitable mean value of @xmath51 over the horizon ) obeys @xmath52 the total entropy decreases and the gsl is broken . 
 we now proceed to search for such flows . 
 we first reconsider known explicit solutions . 
 the above formulae apply for a generic , not necessarily spherically symmetric , accretion flow onto the black hole ; in particular it may have non - vanishing @xmath53 and @xmath54 . as an example , consider the well known bondi flow ( see ref . 
 @xcite and references therein ) . 
 bondi flow starts from rest at infinity and is spherically symmetric . for a polytropic equation of state , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the adiabatic exponent , 
 the accretion velocity is given by @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 @xcite . 
 it follows that bondi flow will obey the gsl if the following condition holds : @xmath61 we have used the usual expression @xmath62 for the schwarzschild black hole . 
 the above conditions would seem to obtain for any fluid with positive pressure thanks to the ube  @xcite . 
 this bound states that the entropy @xmath63 of a generic , weakly self - gravitating , thermodynamic system satisfies @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the body s total energy , while @xmath66 is its linear size . 
 our experience is that the inequality here is usually a strong one . 
 now the minimal size of a parcel of fluid consistent with the fluid description is its correlation length @xmath67 . for a gas , @xmath67 is the mean free path , while for a liquid it is typically the intermolecular distance . 
 applied to such a parcel the ube tells us that ( see the next section for more details ) @xmath68 where we have passed from the total entropy and energy to their densities by dividing by the parcel s proper volume . 
 again , this bound will in most cases be a strong inequality . 
 since the continuum description down to accretion at the black hole makes sense only if @xmath69 , we may conclude that the inequalities  ( [ bondi ] ) will always hold with at least one order of magnitude difference between the r.h.s . and the l.h.s . of the equations 
 in the above argument we have tacitly assumed that @xmath70 . 
 negative pressure is often discussed in cosmology ( dark energy ) ; the functioning of the gsl in the face of dark energy is fraught with subtleties  @xcite . 
 thus bondi flow satisfies the gsl by virtue of the ube . 
 clearly , this happens because the accretion velocity approaches the speed of light , @xmath71 . 
 we now turn to examples of slow ideal fluid accretion flows that do violate the gsl . 
 it is clear from the previous analysis that the gsl holds for any accretion flow of ideal fluid with @xmath71 . 
 we expect such flows whenever spherical accretion starts from a distance @xmath72 from the black hole large compared to @xmath14 ( for bondi flow @xmath73 ) . 
 but what is @xmath50 in the limit @xmath74 ? 
 we now show that @xmath50 vanishes in that limit , thereby giving an example of ideal fluid flow that violates the gsl . 
 we study steady , spherically symmetric accretion flow which starts at @xmath75 with the initial flow and sound velocities , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , specified there . 
 we assume that the relevant initial conditions are physically realizable ; see the appendix for the discussion of this assumption . 
 following ref . 
 @xcite we introduce @xmath78 . 
 the continuity and the euler equations can be written as @xmath79 where a prime denotes @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the baryon number density , and @xmath82,\\ & & d_2=\frac{2u^2/r - m / r^2}{u},\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath83 the local sound velocity . 
 obviously @xmath84 is always positive due to the causality constraint @xmath85 ( sound velocity is smaller than velocity of light )  @xcite . 
 here we consider only flows with @xmath86 so @xmath87 at the horizon 
 .    in bondi flow @xmath88 becomes negative at large @xmath89 which signifies that there exists the so - called sonic radius @xmath90 such that @xmath91 . as is clear from eqs . 
 ( [ derivs ] ) , where @xmath88 stands in the denominator , the sonic radius is a special though regular point of the bondi flow , which in other situations could signify the presence a shock . 
 by contrast , here we shall choose a range of initial parameters for the flow which ensure that @xmath92 , so that there is no sonic point . 
 we assume initial parameters for the flow satisfying @xmath93 it is easy to see from eq . 
 ( [ d ] ) that @xmath94 is indeed positive . 
 we do not need to derive the explicit form of the flow in order to find @xmath50 . 
 it suffices to consider the conservation of the bernoulli integral along the streamlines . 
 the relativistic version of the bernoulli equation reads  @xcite @xmath95 assuming for simplicity the polytropic equation of state  ( [ poly ] ) one finds the following relation @xcite @xmath96,\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the baryon mass . 
 the above relation allows us to rewrite the bernoulli equation as @xmath98 evaluating the above equation first at @xmath40 and then at @xmath75 , equating the results , using inequalities  ( [ in1])-([in2 ] ) and assuming that at the horizon @xmath99 remains much smaller than unity ( which we have verified numerically ) , we find that @xmath100 where the ellipsis stands for subleading terms . 
 the above expression holds for any @xmath101 and @xmath56 , the latter assumed to be not too close to unity .    actually , the use of the polytropic equation is not essential . 
 using eq . 
 ( [ bern ] ) directly we would find @xmath102}{n(r_i)\left[\rho(r_h)+p(r_h)\right ] } \sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r_i}}.\ ] ] if we may assume that there are no abrupt changes in @xmath103 throughout the flow , we recover a result of form eq . 
 ( [ accrvel ] ) . we may conclude that an ideal fluid accretion flow which starts close to the horizon with initial parameters complying with inequalities  ( [ in1])-([in2 ] ) can have arbitrarily small @xmath50 . according to the criterion  ( [ ineq0 ] ) 
 it will thus incur a violation of the gsl .    of course for the above argument to be convincing 
 , we must still demonstrate that it is possible for a flow to start near the horizon with sufficiently small velocity ( and sound speed ) . in the appendix 
 we show in detail that a cord which respects fundamental physical constraints can be used to bring objects to rest arbitrarily near the horizon . 
 one can envision the setting up of the initial conditions for the fluid we require at @xmath75 by this means . 
 the above violation of the gsl raises a paradox . in the real world 
 the gsl can not be violated . 
 this law has been shown to follow from fundamental concepts in quantum theory and classical gravity  @xcite . 
 can the paradox be removed without calling on new physics just for the occasion ? 
 an obvious solution would be to call on hawking s radiance to generate entropy that would at least compensate for the decrement of total entropy pointed out in sec . 
 [ paradox ] . after all , in free hawking emission the thermal radiation entropy creation rate exceeds the associated rate of decrease of the black hole entropy  @xcite . 
 but there exist reasons to reject this as the resolution of our problem . 
 the hawking radiation is capable of preventing a violation of the gsl that would arise if high entropy radiation of the same nature , i.e. , electromagnetic , were injected into a black hole with @xmath104 above the effective radiation temperature  @xcite . 
 its efficacy here is related to the principle of detailed balance in equilibrium ( in fact , for incoming thermal radiation at temperature @xmath104 the hawking radiation exactly balances the entropy decrement ) . 
 now detailed balance refers to modes of the same physical system . 
 there is no detailed balance between radiation and fluid modes . 
 thus if entropic radiation were injected alongside the fluid accretion , the hawking radiation might prove incapable of compensating for the entropy decreases of the two kinds . 
 the above discussion also suggests we should look for a way out of the paradox that hinges on the physics of the fluid itself . in our discussion in sec . 
 [ paradox ] we assume that one can deposit the fluid at an arbitrarily small distance from the horizon at an arbitrary velocity . since the physical paradigm used is that of fluids , one should , as a matter of principle , demand that the said distance is still larger than the correlation length @xmath67 at which the hydrodynamic description first becomes applicable 
 .    to be in the schwarzschild spacetime a small proper length @xmath105 away from the horizon at @xmath106 corresponds to the schwarzschild coordinate @xmath107 ; here @xmath108 and is given explicitly by @xmath109 let us thus substitute @xmath110 for @xmath72 in our expression  ( [ accrvel ] ) : latexmath:[\[\label{u }    correlation length limits the smallness of the accretion velocity @xmath50 . 
 with eq . 
 ( [ u ] ) the expression in square brackets in eq . 
 ( [ entr2 ] ) takes the form @xmath112\,,\ ] ] where we used the expression for the black hole temperature . in order for 
 the gsl to be obeyed the above factor must be nonpositive . 
 this is actually guaranteed by the fluid version of the ube , eq . 
 ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) , as long as the pressure @xmath35 is nonnegative ( see the next section for more details ) . 
 this removes the paradox . 
 the moral of the discussion is that a paradox arises if one relies on the continuum description of a fluid down to an arbitrarily small scale , that is if one takes the notion of ideal fluid literally . to be rid of paradoxa one must take cognizance of the finite correlation length of any physical fluid , _ and _ 
 must accept that the entropy capacity of fluid matter is limited according to bound  ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) . 
 the paradox uncovered in sec . 
 [ paradox ] and its resolution in sec . 
 [ remove ] clearly show that the ideal fluid paradigm is inconsistent . 
 in particular , the picture of a fluid as a perfect continuum is shown to be physically unacceptable : the fluid in question must have a nonvanishing correlation length . the medium is a fluid only over scales exceeding the correlation length . 
 it turns out that finiteness of the correlation length is incompatible with the vanishing of various transport coefficients like shear viscosity and heat conductivity , another feature of the ideal fluid paradigm . for a gas 
 there is a simple way to see this . 
 the usual estimates of the mentioned transport coefficients  @xcite have them proportional to the mean free path of the gas molecules . 
 but in a gas the mean free path and correlation length are the same thing . 
 thus the finite correlation length forces the transport coefficients of the gas , in particular the shear viscosity , to be nonvanishing . 
 we shall see in the sequel that the same conclusion applies generally to any liquid as well . 
 thus a fluid can be fully compatible with the gsl only if it is dissipative to some extent ( and thus not ideal ) . 
 another way of putting this is that a fluid with arbitrarily small shear viscosity is unphysical . 
 how large must the correlation length @xmath67 be ? microscopically speaking it must obviously be at least as large as the intermolecular distance . 
 but can we say something without delving into the structure of the fluid ? 
 let us approach this question in the spirit of wilson s work on the renormalization group  @xcite . 
 we consider some thermodynamic system with the typical linear size @xmath113 . 
 because the system is macroscopic ( by definition ) , one can represent any extensive thermodynamic variable as some quantity times the system s volume @xmath114 . 
 for example , one can write the entropy as @xmath115 and the energy as @xmath116 . now decrease @xmath113 . for sufficiently small @xmath113 , 
 already comparable with the system correlation length @xmath67 , the system ceases to be macroscopic , and extensivity is generally lost . 
 this means that the expressions for the entropy and energy densities themselves become dependent on @xmath113 . 
 the system is no longer a continuum . 
 can one set a lower bound on the correlation radius @xmath67 purely from macroscopic considerations ? 
 the standard answer to the above question would be in the negative . 
 but , surprisingly , the true answer is yes . 
 as we have seen , for a macroscopic system the ube can be restated in the form  ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) , which immediately leads to the inequality @xmath117 the main point here is that a macroscopic system with size much smaller than @xmath118 would violate the ube ; thus the correlation length can not be much smaller . 
 we emphasize , again , that @xmath67 may easily be much larger than the minimal scale  ( [ bekenstein11 ] ) . 
 the above result answers the following question : given a macroscopic system with given entropy and energy densities , what is its minimal possible correlation length ? 
 it shows that macroscopic quantities do  know "" about the minimal correlation length of the system . 
 we mentioned earlier that a nonvanishing correlation length @xmath67 ensures that the transport coefficients of a gas ( which are proportional to @xmath67 ) do not vanish . 
 for example , for shear viscosity one has the order of magnitude estimate  @xcite @xmath119 where the speed of sound @xmath83 is of the order of molecular speed  @xcite . 
 the above estimate together with eq .  ( [ bekenstein11 ] ) give that @xmath120 is subject to the inequality @xmath121    let us show that the estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) , and thus the bound  ( [ new1 ] ) , must hold also for liquids sufficiently far from a critical point . in this preliminary treatment we neglect heat conductivity and bulk viscosity . 
 we note that , for any fluid , density perturbations at scale much larger than @xmath67 generate sound waves . on the other hand , perturbations with scale much smaller than @xmath67 
 are not coherent and produce no sound . 
 furthermore , one can still use hydrodynamics asymptotically to describe the evolution of perturbations with scale @xmath67 . 
 then the demand that there is no well - defined sound at smaller scales gives the asymptotic condition that at scale @xmath67 the wave decay time @xmath122 , as found from hydrodynamics  @xcite , should be comparable with the wave period @xmath123 . 
 this produces the estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) for liquids . 
 alternatively , the results  ( [ estimate])-([new1 ] ) can be recovered by considering a sound wave already propagating through the liquid . 
 its fourier components with reduced wavelengths near or below @xmath67 should decay over a distance comparable to @xmath67 since we can not have macroscopic flow at those smaller scales . 
 now from the _ macroscopic _ point of view , the decay must be caused by transport processes controlled by the viscosities or heat conductivity . according to fluid theory  @xcite , a sound wave of wavelength @xmath124 penetrates a distance of order @xmath125 into the liquid before damping out . according to the above argument , for @xmath126 this penetration length should be @xmath67 , which gives eq . 
 ( [ estimate ] ) again .    for relativistic fluids the above consideration should be modified slightly . here 
 the wave decay time includes @xmath127 instead of @xmath2 @xcite , which leads to @xmath128 for most realistic fluids @xmath129 , see @xcite , and @xmath130 , so this modification is not essential for the order of magnitude estimate of @xmath0 , see the next subsection for an example . 
 the above estimates , however , must fail sufficiently close to a critical point . 
 both @xmath0 and @xmath67 diverge at the critical temperature with the power law @xmath131 holding in the vicinity of the critical point . here 
 @xmath132 is much less than @xmath133  @xcite . 
 this is incompatible with eq . 
 ( [ estimate ] ) because both @xmath2 and @xmath83 are finite at the critical point . 
 the reason for the failure of the estimate is complications in the asymptotic matching procedure above , related to the difference of the critical exponents of the various quantities involved . 
 another issue is that near a critical point the static correlation length @xmath67 becomes different from the scale beyond which hydrodynamics applies .     of experimental viscosities of eleven pure liquids ( data taken mostly from ref . 
 @xcite ) vs log@xmath134 of the estimates from eq . 
 ( [ estimate ] ) with @xmath67 identified with the average intermolecular separation . both viscosities and estimates 
 are in si units ( mpa s ) . 
 nonstandard symbols are `` m '' for methane , `` p '' for propane , `` a '' for acetone , `` e '' for ethanol , `` u '' for undecane ( c@xmath135h@xmath136 ) , `` ni '' for nitrobenzene ( phenil - no@xmath137 ) and `` g '' for glycerol ( c@xmath138h@xmath139o@xmath138 ) . a repeated symbol correspond to viscosities at several pressures and temperatures . the solid line is the locus of @xmath140 ; the dotted lines demarcate the region where the viscosity lies within a factor of 3 of @xmath141 . ] 
 nevertheless , sufficiently far from the critical point the estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) seems to produce remarkably good results , as shown by fig . 
 [ fig : fig1 ] for a number of pure liquids . 
 ( the only resounding failure is glycerol , one of the most viscous fluids known . 
 the problem with it may be that @xmath67 is much larger than the intermolecular separation , which we routinely used as estimator for @xmath67 . ) 
 this fact is remarkable because it allows to reach conclusions on the magnitude of viscosity 
 quite possibly of practical value  even for liquids for which no microscopic theory is available . 
 let us now turn to the lower bound on the viscosity - entropy density ratio  ( [ new1 ] ) . 
 it evidently holds if the estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) works . 
 note that eq . 
 ( [ new1 ] ) will most often be a strong inequality , particularly for nonrelativistic systems , for which the ube is known to be a very liberal bound . 
 thus the bound  ( [ new1 ] ) is generally valid far from a critical point . on the other hand , near the critical point 
 the bound  ( [ new1 ] ) holds trivially because its l.h.s . 
 diverges while its r.h.s . remains finite . 
 thus the divergence of shear viscosity at the critical point  @xcite only strengthens the bound .    the considerations in this subsection 
 provide a strong argument in favor of the existence of a generic lower bound on the viscosity - entropy density ratio . 
 the reformulation of the arguments with regard to the other transport coefficients , including thermal conductivity , is left for future work . 
 it was the challenge presented by the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) which motivated the activity leading to the formulation of the kss bound . 
 as a practical use of our estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) , let us apply it to the qgp . 
 quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts the existence of such a form of matter where the usually confined quarks and gluons are essentially free forming a fireball with a typical size @xmath142 fm . 
 the transition from the hadronic state of matter to the qgp occurs at densities of @xmath143 gev/@xmath144 . 
 qcd lattice calculations predict that the transition should take place at a critical temperature @xmath145 mev , and that the speed of sound for a qgp above @xmath146 mev is about @xmath147 ( see ref . 
 @xcite and further references therein ) . 
 measurements on the qgp at brookhaven s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) indicate that the ratio of energy density @xmath148 to entropy density @xmath1 is roughly proportional to the qgp temperature @xmath149 ( see , e.g. , fig . 3 in ref . 
 specifically , for the high energy results of rhic one has @xmath150 using this and estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) we have @xmath151 where in the last step we assumed @xmath147 at @xmath152 mev , @xmath153 fm corresponding to a number density @xmath154 /@xmath144 , and employed @xmath155 mev fm . 
 our estimate for the qgp viscosity is thus in harmony with the kss bound  ( [ kss ] ) . 
 moreover , it is in quite reasonable agreement with the experimental data which require a shear viscosity to entropy density ratio as low as @xmath156 @xcite . 
 we draw attention to the similarity between inequality  ( [ new1 ] ) with @xmath5 and @xmath157 restored , namely @xmath158 and the conjectured kss bound  ( [ kss ] ) . at first sight 
 this inequality seems to fall well below the kss bound since in many cases @xmath159 . 
 however , we must keep in mind that , especially in such nonrelativistic circumstances , we expect the inequality to be a strong one . 
 the minimum @xmath120 may thus be well above the literal bound  ( [ new2 ] ) , and not necessarily at variance with eq . 
 ( [ kss ] ) . for relativistic media @xmath160 , and there is no difference to speak of between bounds  ( [ kss ] ) and  ( [ new2 ] ) . 
 thus arguments based on the ube , and ultimately on the gsl , seem to suggest a _ 
 raison dtre _ for the mysterious kss bound .    before 
 proceeding we wish to provide an alternative viewpoint . 
 the kss bound eq . 
 ( [ kss ] ) is usually interpreted as saying that a fluid can not be too perfect . 
 however , in the form @xmath161 the bound is really an entropy bound , specifically an upper bound on the entropy density of an arbitrary fluid ( we return to the use of units with @xmath162 as in the previous sections ) . 
 clearly the above bound is reminiscent of the ube , eq . 
 ( [ bekensteinentropy ] ) , and its fluids version , eq . 
 ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) . 
 but at least for non - relativistic fluids , the kss bound is a tighter entropy bound by orders of magnitude than the ube . restoring the speed of light @xmath5 we introduce the variable @xmath163 ( @xmath67 being , again , the correlation length , either the mean free path for a gas , or , typically , the intermolecular separation for a liquid ) which has the dimensions of viscosity . 
 thus eq . 
 ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) gives @xmath164 . using the estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) we have @xmath165 . 
 it follows that for nonrelativistic fluids eq . 
 ( [ kssentropy ] ) is indeed a much tighter entropy bound than eq . 
 ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) . 
 thus the kss bound can be viewed as a tightened version of the ube in guise of eq . 
 ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) which is available for the class of systems exhibiting macroscopic fluid behavior .    both the ideal fluid paradox of sec .  [ paradox ] and the interpretation of the kss bound as an entropy bound for fluids suggest the gsl as a natural frame for investigating relations between entropy bounds . 
 because the ube is obtained in the most transparent way via the gsl , one may hope that the kss bound should likewise be obtainable most simply with help of the gsl . 
 we turn now to considerations in this direction . 
 first we remark that it is not clear how to obtain the kss bound directly from microscopic physics . 
 inspection of the green - kubo formula  @xcite for the viscosity in terms of fluctuations shows no apparent connection of the viscosity and the entropy . 
 such consideration affords no special status to the ratio @xmath120 , at least not from the viewpoint of nongravitational physics . 
 on the other hand , the kss conjecture emerged from holographic type arguments that connect quantum field theory with gravity . 
 it might thus turn out that a derivation of the kss bound requires use of the still nonexistent theory of quantum gravity . 
 but even if this were true , one need not loose heart . 
 there is general agreement that black hole entropy , and the gsl which hinges on it , reflect some aspect of quantum gravity . 
 the kss is not universally accepted . 
 many objections to it rely on scenarios where very many particle species are supposed to exist in nature ( see ref . 
 @xcite for an example and references ) . 
 these are the same objections raised against the validity of the ube ( see ref . 
 @xcite for references ) . 
 in fact , any entropy bound whatsoever invites attacks of this sort , for if the number of species that may show up is unlimited , the entropy can be made as large as desired while keeping parameters like energy or total particle number fixed . 
 although it is formally true that with many species available , the kss bound must fail , this does not detract from its heuristic usefulness ; one is often interested on the entropy of a specific system , one whose particle content is fixed ahead of time . 
 it should also be mentioned that many particle scenarios , if not arbitrarily legislating particle proliferation , conjure up fine - tuned or baroque setups to beget the required large number of species of quasiparticles or excitations . 
 this aspect considerably decreases the appeal of the species proliferation arguments . 
 both of the above considerations make it clear that a ground up approach to deriving the kss bound is unlikely to succeed . 
 alternative , indirect approaches are needed . a point in favor of employing the gsl to investigate the origin of the kss bound 
 is that the gsl  knows "" the actual number of species in nature  @xcite . 
 for example , black hole entropy , which plays a crucial role in the gsl , should in principle depend on the number of elementary fields , yet all derivations endow it with a fixed coefficient which may be thought as determined by the actual number of species . 
 this feature would act to neutralize the above mentioned argument against the validity of the kss bounds . 
 we have worked out the expression for the rate of change of the total entropy of a system consisting of a schwarzschild black hole and ideal fluid which can accrete onto the hole . 
 the well known bondi flow is the case of fast accretion with velocity near to the speed of light ; for it the gsl is always obeyed due to the ube . for sufficiently slow accretion velocity 
 the flow violates the gsl . 
 the question of whether flow with the required small accretion velocity is a realistic option is answered in the affirmative by a critical revision , in the appendix , of the venerable argument  @xcite claiming that it is impossible to adiabatically lower mass to near the black hole horizon . 
 since it is known from microscopic considerations  @xcite that any physical system should comply with the gsl , the above result would constitute a serious paradox if the ideal fluid is a continuum , as usually considered . 
 we find , however , that the paradox can be defused if one takes into account that the continuum picture must break down at some level by virtue of the fluid having a nonvanishing correlation length . 
 an auxiliary role in the nullification of the paradox is played by the universal entropy bound . 
 it gives a lower bound on the correlation length in relation to the fluid s entropy density . 
 the lower bound on the correlation length of an arbitrary thermodynamic system in terms of its ( macroscopic ) entropy and energy densities is an unexpected and thought - provoking aspect of the ube . 
 it makes it clear that the gsl , though a macroscopic law , `` knows '' about the microscopic structure of matter . 
 the lower bound must rank as one of the most impressive consequences of the extension of the second law of thermodynamics to include black holes . 
 the breakdown of the continuum description of a fluid has momentous consequences : discreteness of matter and thermal fluctuations necessarily engender nonideal behavior parameterized by the viscosity and heat conduction coefficients . 
 we have shown that one can expect the existence of a universal lower bound on the viscosity of an arbitrary fluid . 
 our argument yields a seemingly novel estimate for the viscosity of a fluid far from the critical region ; this estimate is shown to be better than an order of magnitude estimate for a range of pure liquids . 
 in addition , the estimate works reasonably well for the quark - gluon plasma , which viscosity was a subject of much study lately @xcite . 
 together with the lower bound on the correlation length , the viscosity estimate yields a lower bound on viscosity per unit entropy density which may be expressed in terms of the sound velocity of the fluid . 
 the appearance of the speed of sound here , in contrast to the ( implicit ) speed of light in the original kss arguments , may signify that the kss argument can be improved , or may perhaps disclose that the field theories considered by kss as representatives of strongly coupled fluids are not sufficiently generic  in all these theories the sound velocity is comparable with the speed of light . 
 an additional issue is whether the bound can be extended to other transport coefficients . 
 if there is indeed a lower bound on the ratio of viscosity to entropy density for an arbitrary fluid , then it is likely to be rooted in some very basic principle of physics . 
 we have shown that the generalized second law of thermodynamics , combining as it does gravity with thermodynamics , can be such a principle . 
 starting from it , one can anticipate that the viscosity to entropy ratio of an arbitrary fluid obeys a certain lower bound . 
 in particular , the gsl incorporates physics that weakens the recent objections  @xcite to the bound s very existence . on the basis of the above 
 , we propose that the use of the gsl may lead to a clarification of the kss bound s origin . 
 although we have made no concrete progress towards reaching a final sharp inequality , we have given for the first time physical arguments indicating that this elusive bound , whose existence is sometimes disputed , indeed exists .

 we reexamine the problem and show that , in fact , the energy condition need not be violated and thus that adiabatic lowering down to the horizon is , in principle , possible .    in the stationary state of some matter in the vicinity of a spherical black hole , 
 the energy momentum tensor obeys @xmath166 where we used the symmetry of @xmath167  @xcite . 
 below we concentrate on configurations for which @xmath168 is diagonal . using the same coordinates as in sec . 
 [ balance ] , the @xmath169 component of the above equations is satisfied automatically , while the radial component gives @xmath170    the above equation gives a linear relation between the different components of the stress tensor which need not , _ a priori _ , respect the weak energy condition . as an example , consider a thin spherical shell in equilibrium . for the shell 
 the contribution of @xmath171 in the above equation is negligible . 
 this can be seen by noting that @xmath171 vanishes at the shell boundaries , and as a result its values within the shell vanish together with the ratio of shell thickness to radius . far from the hole , where the shell is describable by the classical linear elasticity theory , 
 the maximal value of @xmath171 is found to be proportional to the square of the above ratio . 
 so the thin shell is basically supported by the tangential stresses @xmath172 and @xmath173 , which must be equal because of spherical symmetry . 
 ( [ radial ] ) gives @xmath174 . 
 now the weak energy condition would demand @xmath175 . 
 it is thus clear that a stationary thin shell would violate the condition at @xmath176 . 
 thus a physical thin shell , i.e. one obeying the energy condition , can not support itself arbitrarily close to the horizon ( see ref . 
 @xcite for the more detailed discussion ) .    ref . 
 @xcite argued that the rope can not be in equilibrium with its lower end arbitrarily close to the black hole , similarly to the thin shell above . here 
 we wish to correct this conclusion . 
 we shall assume that the rope fibers can be considered radial , such as in the case of a conical rope filling the portion of space defined by some solid angle . 
 since the rope can only support stresses along its fibers , the general form of its energy - momentum tensor is @xmath177 $ ] , and eq .  ( [ radial ] ) gives @xmath178    the above linear equation can be used to express the stress @xmath179 in terms of the rope density @xmath2 and the boundary condition at the lower end of the rope , @xmath180 , which is defined by the load . 
 the solution can be written as a sum @xmath181 , where @xmath182 describes the stresses caused by the load , while @xmath183 describes the stresses caused by the rope s own weight . 
 the expression for @xmath182 ( the solution for a weightless rope ) expresses the `` constancy of the tension '' along the rope : @xmath184 where @xmath185 is determined by the weight of the load ; for a point mass @xmath97 we have @xmath186 . note that @xmath182 is negative , as befitting a tension . 
 the `` constancy of the tension '' gives monotonically decreasing @xmath187 as one moves out because the rope cross - section increases with @xmath89 by the assumed symmetry of the fibers . 
 the expression for @xmath183 ( the solution without the load ) describes how the force caused by the rope above some @xmath89 balances the weight of the rope below : @xmath188 for definiteness we shall consider below the case of the rope with a constant density @xmath189 where integration gives @xmath190 . \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ]    we now show that the above solution does not violate the weak energy condition @xmath191 , and in particular , that no violation occurs even when the rope s end is arbitrarily close to the horizon . by choosing sufficiently large @xmath189 we may always disregard @xmath182 , so it is sufficient to show that @xmath192 . 
 it is easy to see from eq . 
 ( [ a1 ] ) that the maximum of @xmath193 , at given @xmath189 and @xmath25 , grows as @xmath194 decreases . this just means that the maximal stress is the bigger the closer the lower end of the rope is from the horizon . 
 therefore , it is enough to show that @xmath192 for @xmath194 which is infinitesimally close to @xmath106 . in general , 
 @xmath195 , vanishing as it is at both endpoints , @xmath180 and @xmath196 , has a unique maximum at @xmath197 . 
 it is easy to see numerically that in the limit @xmath198 the point @xmath199 also tends to @xmath14 . 
 defining @xmath200 we find analytically @xmath201 where @xmath202 and the dots stand for subleading terms . 
 it follows from the above that the weak energy condition is obeyed for any @xmath203 . 
 thus , at least from the viewpoint of the energy conditions , it is possible in principle to lower a body adiabatically all the way down to the horizon by means of a suitably constructed rope . 
 our result is at variance with that of gibbons  @xcite . 
 the discrepancy arises because he missed a term when calculating a certain 4-divergence ( eq . 
 ( 5 ) in ref . 
 @xcite ) . by taking this term into account , the main result , eq . 
 ( 8) in ref . 
 @xcite , now reads @xmath204 here @xmath205 is the tension , @xmath206 the rope s cross section , @xmath207 the energy per unit proper length of the rope , and @xmath208 is the norm of the timelike killing field @xmath209 ( the spacetime is taken to be stationary ) . in the original derivation , the term @xmath149 in the denominator of the l.h.s . 
 ( [ gibb ] ) is absent . 
 the corrected eq . 
 ( [ gibb ] ) is indeed in accord with our eq . 
 ( [ drs ] ) . observing that in the schwarzschild geometry 
 @xmath210 and further @xmath211 for the case of a conical rope , one easily checks that eq . 
 ( [ gibb ] ) reduces to our eq . 
 ( [ drs ] ) . 
 our analysis demonstrates that no problem of principle militates against the creation of the boundary conditions required for the slow accretion flow considered in sec .

62,"when infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) were originally identified as dark extinction features against the galactic background at mid - ir wavelengths @xcite , it was not clear what role , if any , they might play in the process of star formation . 
 their high column densities ( @xmath4@xmath5 @xmath6 ) , together with their cold temperatures ( @xmath7 k ) suggest that if stars do form within irdcs , then irdcs must comprise an early phase in the process ; otherwise the embedded stars would have heated their surrounding gas and dust . recently 
 , compact molecular cores within irdcs have been found to contain embedded young stars or protostars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 a few of these embedded young stellar objects will evolve into high - mass stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 this star - formation activity , along with the similarity in size and mass between irdcs and cluster - forming molecular clumps , has led to the suggestion that irdcs are the birthplaces of all high - mass stars and clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 one striking feature of irdcs is their filamentary shape , evident in the images from mid - ir galactic surveys such as _ msx _ @xcite , glimpse @xcite , and mipsgal @xcite . 
 similar filamentary structures are also found in familiar examples of associated high - mass star - forming molecular clouds , such as orion ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 because these warmer clouds bear a striking resemblance to irdcs , the warm , star - forming filamentary clouds may represent a later evolutionary stage in the life of an irdc . 
 indeed , filamentary clouds may play an important role in high - mass star formation because they allow for enhanced accretion rates onto cores @xcite . 
 an extreme example of a filamentary irdc is the  nessie "" nebula centered near @xmath8 . 
 nessie is identified as a dark mid - ir extinction feature in the glimpse and mipsgal surveys ( figure [ figure1 ] ) . 
 if the mid - ir extinction represents a single object , then this irdc has an unusually large aspect ratio of over 150:1 ( @xmath9 ) . 
 nessie contains a number of extinction maxima which in other irdcs are typically associated with pre - stellar and protostellar cores with masses of order 100 @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 if the formation of irdcs , perhaps due to the passage of a spiral shock , results in filaments , then these long , approximately cylindrical structures may produce the necessary conditions for the formation of dense molecular cores , and ultimately of clusters and high - mass stars . 
 indeed , the theory of gravitationally bound gaseous cylinders predicts the formation of such dense cores , which due to the  sausage "" or  varicose "" fluid instability , fragment from the cylinder at roughly regular intervals ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 this instability provides an attractive physical mechanism for high - mass star formation and cluster formation in filamentary irdcs .    in this _ 
 letter _ we report on molecular line mapping of the nessie nebula . 
 we compare our results with the theory of self - gravitating fluid cylinders and show that the observations broadly conform to the expectations of the `` sausage '' instability . 
 we speculate that this mechanism may be important in the formation of high - mass stars and star clusters . 
 millimeter molecular line observations of the nessie nebula were taken on 2008 august with the australia telescope national facility ( atnf ) 22 m mopra telescope . 
 the backend consisted of the wideband mops correlator configured to observe simultaneously 16 separate passbands covering the frequency range 86 to 93 ghz . 
 each of these passbands was 137.5 mhz wide , with 4096 spectral channels , corresponding to a velocity resolution of 0.11 . 
 we chose individual passbands to include molecular lines of interest . 
 the brightest of the detected lines was ( 10)(90.66 ghz ) . 
 although we detected a number of fainter molecular lines , these yield similar results and will be presented in a subsequent paper . 
 the nebula was mapped in the `` on - the - fly '' mode , in which data are collected while the telescope scans in a raster pattern . 
 the raster rows were chosen to be perpendicular to the galactic plane in order to avoid striping artifacts parallel to the nebula s long axis . 
 the spacing between rows was 12  , or about 1/3 of the mopra beamwidth of 36  fwhm @xcite 
 . flux calibration with a noise diode and an ambient temperature load was performed every 20 minutes . 
 data reduction and analysis utilized the atnf livedata and gridzilla programs . 
 the individual spectra were co - added and gridded onto a uniform 15  grid . 
 linear baselines were removed from line - free channels . 
 all spectra are presented on the antenna temperature ( @xmath11 ) scale . to convert to main - beam brightness temperatures 
 , one should divide the antenna temperatures by the main - beam efficiency of 0.49 @xcite . 
 system temperatures for the observations were @xmath12 k , which yielded a typical rms noise of @xmath13 k in each spectral channel . 
 the mopra integrated intensity ( 10)maps closely correspond to the regions of mid - ir extinction ( figure [ figure1 ] ) . 
 the map consists of fainter , uniform emission associated with the filament , upon which compact , brighter regions we call `` cores '' are superposed . 
 gaussian fits to the ( 10)lines demonstrate that every position within nessie has essentially the same radial velocity , @xmath14 @xmath2  ( figure [ figure1 ] ) 
 . if the clemens rotation curve is used , this velocity corresponds to a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc @xcite . 
 the molecular cores in nessie are often associated star - formation activity . 
 specifically , many cores show the presence of excess 4.5 @xmath15 m emission called `` green fuzzies , '' which indicates shocked gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and bright 24 @xmath15 m point sources , which indicate an embedded protostar ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 the cores do not appear to be randomly spaced within the filament , but instead have a characteristic spacing . 
 the filament is thus reminiscent of a string with beads that are spaced sparsely but approximately uniformly along its length . 
 we used the clumpfind2d algorithm with a threshold of seven times the rms noise and 2.5@xmath16 increments @xcite on the ( 10)integrated intensity map to identify 12 molecular cores ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) . 
 the exact choice of clumpfind parameters will result in the identification of slightly more or fewer cores , but the resulting core spacing is quite insensitive to reasonable input parameters . since the cores are relatively isolated and well separated , clumpfind works well and identifies the cores that one would tend to select by eye . 
 the positions and selected properties of the cores are listed in table [ coretable ] . 
 columns 1 and 2 give the galactic coordinates of the position of peak integrated hnc intensity in each core , column 3 the peak hnc integrated intensity , columns 4 and 5 the angular size and physical extent , column 6 the lte mass ( see section [ discussion ] ) , and column 7 whether or not the core contains a 24 @xmath15 m point source . the mean projected spacing between cores 
 is roughly 4.5 pc . 
 although we prefer to use the molecular gas clumps as our indicator of core spacing , since we thereby include pre - stellar cores , another useful indicator of cluster - forming sites would be 24 @xmath15 m point sources , which indicate embedded high - mass stars or protostars . 
 indeed , about half of the molecular cores contain 24 @xmath15 m point sources ( see table [ coretable ] ) . 
 for all of the unresolved 24 @xmath15 m sources associated with the nebula , we find typical spacing of 4.1 pc , a value within 10% of the molecular core spacing . 
 thus , both the spacing of gas clumps and of 24 @xmath15 m sources are in satisfactory agreement . 
 the existence of cores that are spaced at approximately a characteristic spacing within a highly filamentary cloud is in broad agreement with the predictions of fragmentation of a self - gravitating fluid cylinder due to the  sausage "" instability . 
 the theory s original presentation by @xcite treated an incompressible fluid . 
 later refinements included an isothermal , thermally supported cylinder with various magnetic field configurations @xcite . 
 although the fragmentation due to the  sausage "" instability of a self - gravitating fluid cylinder is similar to three - dimensional jeans collapse , there are important differences . in spherical gravitational jeans 
 collapse , perturbations of all wavenumbers grow at the same rate , but in cylindrical gravitational collapse perturbations with certain wavenumbers grow more quickly than others . perturbations with the most unstable wavenumber will grow fastest , and hence overdensities ( cores ) will tend to form at a length scale whose wavenumber corresponds to this fastest growing mode . for a cylinder of infinite radius , 
 this length scale is maintained even in the presence of a magnetic field parallel to the filament s axis @xcite . 
 the theory thus predicts ( 1 ) that multiple cores should form within a filament , and ( 2 ) that the spacing between these cores should be roughly periodic , with a characteristic length scale equal to the wavelength of the fastest growing unstable mode of the fluid instability . for an incompressible fluid , this wavelength is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the cylinder s radius @xcite . in an infinite isothermal gas cylinder , 
 the relation is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the isothermal scale height given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the sound speed , @xmath23 the gravitational constant , and @xmath24 the gas mass density at the center of the filament ( @xmath25 ) @xcite . for isothermal cylinders of finite radius @xmath18 surrounded by an external , uniform medium , 
 the spacing depends on the ratio between the cylinder radius and the isothermal scale height , @xmath26 . for @xmath27 
 the core spacing approaches that for an infinite radius cylinder , @xmath19 , but for @xmath28 the spacing reduces to that of the incompressible case , @xmath17 . 
 we now compare the observations of nessie to this theory under the assumption that nessie is well approximated by an isothermal cylinder . 
 if nessie lies in the limit @xmath28 , the theory reduces to that of an incompressible fluid , and predicts cores spaced at a characteristic length scale @xmath29 . 
 one can estimate the radius @xmath18 of nessie from the radial extent of the sharp extinction edges evident in the glimpse and mipsgal images . 
 this suggests a radius of @xmath30 or @xmath31 pc at the kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc @xcite . 
 thus , one would expect cores to form at a spacing of @xmath32 pc , in satisfactory agreement with the observations if the filament axis is mostly perpendicular to the line of sight . 
 if nessie is treated as an isothermal gas cylinder with a central volume density @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 k , appropriate for cold , dense , molecular gas traced by ( 10)emission , then the isothermal scale height is @xmath36 pc . 
 thus , nessie would be in the regime @xmath27 , and the theoretical spacing between cores should be @xmath37 pc . 
 this is smaller than the observed spacing by about a factor of 5 . 
 this discrepancy may arise from the fact that turbulent pressure dominates over thermal pressure . 
 theoretical studies of self - gravitating cylinders usually assume that thermal pressure is the dominant gas pressure . 
 however , because the observed linewidths in most molecular clouds typically exceed the thermal sound speeds by large factors , turbulent pressure usually dominates over thermal pressure . 
 if one replaces the sound speed @xmath22 with the velocity dispersion @xmath16 to account for turbulent pressure @xcite , the effective scale height @xmath38 is increased considerably over the thermal scale height @xmath20 . 
 assuming a central volume density again of @xmath39 @xmath34 , and a fwhm linewidth of 2.5 , typically observed toward nessie , the effective scale height is @xmath40 pc , which leads to a spacing of @xmath41 pc between the cores . 
 again , the theoretical prediction is in satisfactory agreement with the observations , especially since the central density and hence the scale height @xmath20 is uncertain . 
 moreover , the theoretical assumption of a uniform , isothermal cylinder ( sometimes embedded in a uniform pressure external medium ) is obviously idealized , and the fragmentation length scale may well differ in more realistic treatments . 
 the theory also predicts that self - gravitating cylinders in equilibrium have a maximum , critical linear mass density ( mass per unit length along the cylinder s axis ) . above the critical value 
 , the cylinder would collapse radially into a line . 
 this critical linear mass density is given by @xmath42 ; where @xmath43 is the sound speed @xmath22 in the case of thermal support ( stodolkiewicz 1963 , ostriker 1964 ) and the turbulent velocity dispersion @xmath16 in the case of turbulent support @xcite . 
 if turbulent pressure dominates over thermal pressure in nessie , the critical linear mass density can be estimated as @xmath44 @xmath10 @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is in units of . for typical line widths observed in nessie ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 . 
 [ note that magnetic fields can alter the critical linear mass density , increasing it for poloidal fields and decreasing it for toroidal fields , but probably by small factors @xmath51 @xcite . ] 
 the mass per unit length in the nessie nebula can be estimated from the ( 10)fluxes , although this estimate is difficult due to uncertainties in molecular abundances , depletion of molecules frozen onto cold dust grains , and optical depth effects . nevertheless , assuming optically thin ( 10)emission , lte , a temperature of 10 k , and an hnc abundance of x@xmath52 @xcite appropriate for cold clouds , we arrive at a typical linear mass density in nessie of 110 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 . because this value is smaller than the maximum predicted by theory , the estimated linear mass density is consistent with theoretical expectations . 
 unfortunately , the reported abundances of hnc vary widely , with values for cold clouds ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath54 @xcite . 
 these hnc abundance values give rise to a wide range in the linear mass density of up to @xmath55 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 . 
 future observations of the dust continuum will better constrain the linear mass density . 
 it is interesting to compare the value of @xmath56 obtained by theory and estimated in nessie with that measured for the molecular filament associated with orion , @xmath57 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 , assuming m = @xmath58 m@xmath49 and @xmath59 pc @xcite . 
 this value is within a factor of a few of that estimated for nessie , and also smaller than the maximum value predicted by theory . 
 the maximum mass of the cores can also be estimated from theory . 
 the core masses should roughly be given by @xmath60 . 
 assuming the maximum , critical value for @xmath56 of @xmath61 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 for the case of turbulent pressure support , and a spacing of 4.5 pc , one expects the cores to have maximum masses @xmath62 . 
 if instead the average linear mass density of 110 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 derived for nessie is used , the core masses should be no larger than about @xmath63 . 
 for nessie , the estimated core masses based on the integrated ( 10)fluxes over the solid angles range from @xmath64 ( table [ coretable ] ) 
 .    to summarize , if turbulent pressure , rather than thermal pressure , provides the support for nessie , the core spacing ( 4.5 pc ) agrees with theoretical predictions . 
 moreover , both the linear mass density and the core masses in nessie are also consistent with the theory , since they are comparable to , but fall below , the maximum theoretical values . 
 we speculate that all cluster formation arises from the fragmentation of filamentary irdcs due to fluid instabilities that lead to massive , star - forming cores . 
 the periodic spacing of such cores within nessie strengthens this suggestion . 
 moreover , filamentary molecular gas clouds are usually associated with high - mass star - forming regions , such as orion , and these warmer clouds bear a striking resemblance to irdcs . 
 such clouds may represent a later evolutionary stage of a filamentary irdc . 
 a cartoon sketch of the proposed evolution of irdcs is given in figure [ cartoon ] . 
 initially a filamentary irdc is formed . 
 the filament reaches an equilibrium configuration with a linear mass density close to the critical value . 
 the filament then fragments due to the `` sausage '' instability into roughly periodically spaced cores . 
 such dense molecular cores have sufficiently large masses to form clusters . the mass of the cores is set by a combination of the turbulent velocity dispersion , which determines the linear mass density , and the wavelength of the fastest growing mode of the `` sausage '' instability . 
 thus , the cluster - forming core mass , and ultimately , the mass of the resulting cluster , is determined by the physics of the turbulent , self - gravitating cylindrical fluid . within the more massive cores , high - mass protostars form . when an embedded o or an early b protostar eventually reaches the main sequence , it ionizes the surrounding gas and creates a bubble in the interstellar medium @xcite . eventually the embedded cluster emerges .    in the earliest phases , then , filamentary irdcs with several cores would be observed . 
 as the regions form , bubbles would be associated with the irdcs , and eventually the irdc would be segmented and disrupted as the regions grow and overlap . 
 later , the filament would contain one or more bright clusters , and appear similar to the filamentary molecular clouds associated with high - mass star - forming regions such as orion and ngc 6334 @xcite . 
 examples of each of these proposed stages can easily be found , from dark filamentary irdcs like g@xmath65 , sometimes called the snake @xcite , to irdcs containing one or more bubble - like regions such as nessie , to active high - mass star - forming regions like orion and ngc 6334 . 
 we have imaged a filamentary irdc , the nessie nebula , in ( 10)molecular line emission with the atnf mopra telescope . because the ( 10)radial velocities are uniform across the filament 
 , nessie is a coherent , single cloud . 
 both ( 10)and mid - ir images reveal that nessie contains numerous dense cores , which appear to have a roughly periodic spacing of 4.5 pc . 
 the theory of self - gravitating , gaseous cylinders shows that they are unstable to a fluid instability , called the `` sausage '' instability , which causes the filament to fragment into cores with a roughly constant spacing . 
 thus , unlike the jeans collapse of uniform media , the fragmentation of cylinders has a preferred length scale . 
 theory predicts that the fastest growing wavelength scales as the radius @xmath18 or the isothermal scale height @xmath20 of the cylinder , depending on the ratio @xmath26 . in the conditions 
 thought to be appropriate to nessie , the spacing between clumps is predicted to be 4 to 6 pc , in good agreement with the observed spacing of 4.5 pc .    because of the ubiquity of the association between filamentary molecular clouds and high - mass star forming regions , it is tempting to suggest that the physics of molecular filaments has a profound influence on cluster formation . indeed 
 , such filaments may be a necessary initial condition to form dense cluster - forming cores with the observed properties . 
 we speculate that the `` sausage '' instability may be the dominant physical mechanism to produce cores from filamentary irdcs . 
 we suggest an evolutionary sequence in which filamentary irdcs fragment into cores , which in turn spawn star clusters and high - mass stars . 
 thus , familiar high - mass star - forming clouds such as orion may have begun their lives as filamentary irdcs .

63,"soon after the first experimental realization of graphene , a single - layer hexagonal form of carbon , the integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe)@xcite was observed by novoselov _ et al . 
 _  and zhang _ _ et al.__@xcite at filling factors @xmath2 . 
 the @xmath3 period is understood straightforwardly as a consequence of the four - fold ( near ) degeneracy of landau levels ( lls ) in graphene ; the zeeman energy is small in comparison to the interaction energy scale , and the pseudospin degree of freedom , which represents the two inequivalent dirac - cones at the corners of the brillouin zone , does not couple to external fields if the two sublattices are equivalent . 
 the offset @xmath4 is a consequence of a dirac - like effective hamiltonian , which produces a linear dispersion for low energy electronic states @xcite . 
 recently , zhang _ _ et al.__@xcite have observed quantum hall plateaus at @xmath5 . 
 although external effects can surely lift the four - fold degeneracy of the low - lying lls , yang , das sarma and macdonald@xcite have shown that the exchange interaction can break the su(4 ) symmetry spontaneously , and the charged excitations are skyrmions @xcite in the @xmath6 landau levels at @xmath7 ( or , by particle - hole symmetry , at @xmath8 ) where @xmath9 is the filling factor within the landau level in question . 
 this has been confirmed @xcite by exact diagonalization for @xmath10 with @xmath11 particles . 
 although the fractional quantum hall effect@xcite ( fqhe ) has not yet been observed in graphene , it has been explored theoretically @xcite assuming an su(2 ) symmetry , as appropriate , for example , when the zeeman energy is sufficiently high that only the two - fold pseudospin degeneracy remains . in this situation 
 , the graphene fqhe problem formally maps into the well studied problem of fqhe in gaas in the zero zeeman energy limit@xcite , with the pseudospin of the former playing the role of the spin of the latter . in the @xmath12 graphene ll , 
 the interaction pseudopotentials@xcite are identical to those in gaas , so the mapping is perfect , and the earlier composite - fermion results of refs . 
 carry over to graphene with minimal change ( spin replaced by pseudospin ) . 
 in particular , it follows that fqhe occurs at fractional fillings given by @xmath13 , with pseudospin singlet states at even @xmath14 and pseudospin polarized states at odd @xmath14 ( fully pseudospin polarized for @xmath15 ) , terminating into a pseudospin singlet composite fermion fermi sea in the limit of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . 
 the effective interaction in the @xmath18 lls in graphene interpolates between those of the @xmath19th and @xmath20st lls for the quadratic dispersion ; the composite fermion formation@xcite , and therefore the fqhe , are found to be almost as strong in the @xmath21 ll in graphene as in the lowest ll of gaas @xcite . 
 it is natural to wonder if fqhe with _ 
 structure appears in graphene . for this purpose , 
 we explore in this work fqhe including the full su(4 ) symmetry . by a combination of exact diagonalization and the cf theory 
 , we find new fqhe states which result from an essential interplay between the spin and the pseudospin degrees of freedom ; such states occur at @xmath22 for @xmath1 . 
 for other states , the energy spectrum of the su(4 ) problem matches with that of the su(2 ) problem , although the multiplicities are vastly different . 
 we show by exact diagonalization that the su(4 ) symmetry is spontaneously broken at @xmath23 just as at @xmath7 , i.e. , the orbital part of the ground state is antisymmetric and the excitations are skyrmionic . at @xmath24 and @xmath25 , 
 the orbital part of ground state is the same as in the su(2 ) symmetric system , but the state is now a highly degenerate su(4 ) multiplet . 
 the outline of the paper is as follows . 
 we review the methods in sec . 
 [ methods ] . in sec . 
 [ newstates ] we generalize the composite fermion theory to su(4 ) electrons , using fock s condition and constructing all possible wave functions of incompressible , filled @xmath26 level states of composite fermions . 
 we also indicate which states have analogs in gaas and which do not . 
 section [ onethird ] is concerned with exact diagonalization results for small systems , which are compared to the predictions of the cf theory . 
 skyrmion - like excitations are also discussed . in sec . 
 [ thermo ] we obtain thermodynamic energies using the cf theory to determine the thermodynamic ground states . 
 section [ phasetrans ] discusses zero - temperature phase transitions and lists the cf predictions for the parameters where the new fqhe states should be observable . 
 the paper is concluded in section [ conclu ] . 
 the electronic structure of graphene is well described by a tight binding model@xcite , which gives a vaulted band structure with the valence and conductance bands touching in the symmetry protected dirac ( or fermi ) points at the six corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone . 
 the low energy states , in particular , occupy double cones@xcite with apices at the corners . 
 only two of these six double cones are inequivalent , giving rise to a pseudospin degree of freedom . denoting spin by @xmath27 and pseudospin by @xmath28 , 
 the low energy states are described in the continuum approximation by an effective hamiltonian@xcite @xmath29 that acts on a 4-spinor hilbert space . here 
 @xmath30 m / s is the fermi velocity , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the on - site energy difference between the two sublattices , @xmath33 is the pseudospin operator , and @xmath27 is the spin . letting @xmath34 , measuring distance in units of the magnetic length @xmath35 , and using the symmetric gauge @xmath36 , this hamiltonian is diagonalized by the normalized eigenvectors @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the eigenstate of the hamiltonian with quadratic dispersion in ll @xmath14 with angular momentum ( @xmath41 ) equal to @xmath42 : @xmath43 the corresponding energies are @xmath44 in the limit @xmath45 , the four vectors @xmath46 are degenerate , giving rise to an su(4 ) internal symmetry . 
 the su(4 ) approximation is valid if @xmath47 and @xmath32 are small in comparison to the scale of the interactions , @xmath48 . while @xmath32 is not easy to estimate , it is generally believed to be much smaller than @xmath49 . 
 one can check that @xmath50},\ ] ] where @xmath51 $ ] is the magnetic field in tesla . 
 obviously , both @xmath52 and @xmath53 depend strongly on the interaction with environment in which the graphene sheet is placed . 
 as two extremes , one can take @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( the graphite value ) . 
 on the other hand , zhang _ et al . 
 _ @xcite find @xmath56 . with these extreme values , assuming an extremely high field @xmath57 t 
 , we get @xmath58 thus the su(4 ) symmetric approximation is typically valid unless @xmath52 happens to be close to the high end of the estimation .    the interaction between eigenstates is conveniently described in terms of pseudopotentials@xcite , where the pseudopotential @xmath59 gives the energy of two electrons in relative angular momentum @xmath42 . as a consequence of eqs . 
 ( [ lllpseudo ] ) and ( [ otherpseudo ] ) , the problem of interacting electrons in the @xmath14th ll of graphene can be mapped into a problem of interacting electrons in @xmath60 states with effective pseudopotentials@xcite @xmath61 where the form factor @xmath62 is @xmath63    the problem of interacting electrons is conveniently formulated in the spherical geometry , in which electrons move on the surface of a sphere and a radial magnetic field is produced by a magnetic monopole of strength @xmath64 at the center.@xcite here @xmath65 is the magnetic flux through the surface of the sphere ; @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is an integer according to dirac s quantization condition.@xcite for quadratic dispersion the single particle states are monopole harmonics@xcite @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the angular momentum with @xmath70 being the ll index , @xmath71 is the @xmath72-component of angular momentum . the coulomb interaction is evaluated with the chord distance . the analogous solution for carriers with linear dispersion , described by the massless dirac s equation , 
 is not known for the spherical geometry . 
 we proceed to work in the basis of the monopole harmonics @xmath73 of the lowest ll , while using the effective pseudopotentials given in eq . 
 ( [ effective ] ) . because we have @xmath74 , in the @xmath12 landau level the pseudopotentials derived by fano _ _ et al.__@xcite can be used . in other landau levels , however , we will use the effective pseudopotentials of the _ planar _ geometry ( eq .  ( 
 [ effective ] ) ) on the sphere . 
 such an identification is obviously exact in the thermodynamic limit , but is usually reasonable also for finite systems . 
 we neglect the finite thinkness of the two dimensional electron system , which is a much better approximation in graphene than in gaas heterostructures . 
 the neglect of landau level mixing , also made below , is a more tricky assumption because both the ll separation ( c.f . 
 ( [ landaulevels ] ) ) and the interaction energy scale as @xmath75 , and are of the same order . 
 however , their relative strengths can be controlled by variation of other parameters ( fermi velocity , dielectric constant , etc . ) , and we will assume in the following that the ll separation is large enough to suppress ll mixing . 
 we will compare the exact diagonalization results to the composite fermion theory @xcite , and also use this theory to explore the thermodynamic limit . 
 ( exact diagonalization can be performed only for very small systems for su(4 ) symmetry . ) the composite fermion ( cf ) theory maps the strongly interacting system of electrons in a partially filled landau level to a system of weakly interacting particles called composite fermions , which are bound states of an electron and an even number of quantized vortices . 
 the mapping consists of attaching @xmath76 quantized vortices of the many - body wave function to each electron . 
 the quantized vortices produce berry phases that partly cancel the external magnetic field , and consequently composite fermions feel a reduced magnetic field @xmath77 . 
 composite fermions in magnetic field @xmath78 fill quantized kinetic energy levels analogous to landau levels , called @xmath26 levels . if @xmath42 @xmath26 levels are filled , which corresponds to a filling factor @xmath79 , an incompressible quantum liquid state results . 
 the fqhe is thus explained as the iqhe of composite fermions .    according to the cf theory , 
 the wave functions for correlated electrons in the lowest landau level at monopole strength @xmath64 are given by @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a wave function for @xmath83 non - interacting electrons at monopole strength @xmath84 , operator @xmath85 projects a state into the @xmath12 ll , and @xmath86 and @xmath87 . 
 the procedure taking us from @xmath82 to @xmath88 is called  composite - fermionization , "" which also converts electronic landau levels into @xmath26 levels of composite fermions . 
 incompressible ground states are constructed by completely filling the lowest few @xmath26 levels in one or more spin bands . 
 the explicit relation between the monopole strength @xmath64 , the filling factor @xmath89 and the particle number @xmath83 is given below in eq . 
 ( [ mono ] ) . 
 the above cf construction is valid for the orbital part of the wave function independent of whether the landau levels are singly , doubly , or quadruply degenerate , i.e. , whether the low - energy electronic states have no internal ( nonorbital ) symmetry , have su(2 ) symmetry , or have su(4 ) symmetry , respectively . 
 however , while any antisymmetric wave function is valid for a singly degenerate landau level , only those wave functions are legitimate for su(2 ) which are eigenstates of @xmath90 and @xmath91 . for su(@xmath14 ) 
 electrons , the wave functions are eigenfunctions of all the casimir operators and the generators of the abelian subalgebra of the lie algebra of su(@xmath14 ) . among such functions 
 the so - called maximal weight states@xcite satisfy fock s cyclic condition@xcite . 
 the idea will be to construct valid iqhe wave functions @xmath82 , and then show that their  composite fermionization "" produces fqhe wave functions with valid symmetry . 
 fock s cyclic condition tells us which orbital wave functions are legitimate for the highest weight state in the multiplet @xmath92 $ ] of su(@xmath14 ) . 
 we are using the young tableau notation for the su(@xmath14 ) multiplets : @xmath93 are integers , @xmath94 being the length of the @xmath95-th row of the young tableau of the representation . 
 ( the last @xmath94 s are omitted if zero . ) 
 recall that young tableaux are generated from the direct products of the fundamental representation ( a single box ) with symmetrization in the rows and antisymmetrization in the columns . 
 let @xmath96 be a basis of the ( @xmath14-dimensional ) fundamental representation of su(@xmath14 ) , and let @xmath97 be the number of particles assumed to be in the @xmath98 internal state . 
 let @xmath99 where @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is the antisymmetrizer . 
 assume @xmath102 is antisymmetric in each subset @xmath103 of its variables . 
 @xmath104 is a highest weight state ( w.r.t .  a choice of positive roots ) if and only if it is annihilated by any attempt to antisymmetrize an electron @xmath105 of type @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) with respect to the electrons of type @xmath108 , i.e. @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the identity and @xmath111 permutes indices @xmath112 and @xmath105 . 
 consequently , any orbital wavefunction @xmath113 where @xmath114 s are slater determinants such that any state @xmath115 in @xmath114 is also filled in @xmath116 ( conversely , if @xmath115 is empty in @xmath114 , then it is also empty in @xmath117 ) , is a legitimate highest weight wave function for su(@xmath14 ) . 
 this class includes iqhe states ( @xmath118 has the lowest @xmath119 landau level completely filled ; @xmath119 s are in decreasing order ) , fermi sea states , and single particle , single hole , and particle - hole pair states above the iqhe and fermi sea states , provided that no hole is created in spin state @xmath120 in a ll that is filled in @xmath117 , and , conversely , no particle is created in spin state @xmath120 in a ll that is unfilled in @xmath116 .    if state @xmath82 satisfies fock s condition ( [ condi ] ) , so does @xmath88 given by eq . ( [ cfwf ] ) , and is therefore a legitimate state . 
 thus composite fermion states with parallel or antiparallel flux attachment can be constructed from electronic hartree - fock states as usual . the cf theory for su(2 ) 
 systems thus generalizes trivially to su(@xmath14 ) systems . 
 these observations enable us to construct variational wave functions for @xmath121 . for @xmath122 , 
 a single filled @xmath26 level ( in one of the @xmath98 spin bands ) is the only candidate for an incompressible ground state ; the su(4 ) multiplet is @xmath123 $ ] . for @xmath124 , 
 the two @xmath26 levels are filled with particles of identical or different spin state ; the multiplet is @xmath123 $ ] or @xmath125 $ ] , respectively . as the restriction on the orbital part of the cf wave functions is identical to the su(2 ) case , we expect the latter is prefered in the absence of a symmetry - breaking field . 
 the construction of composite fermion ground states for fractions where four @xmath26-levels can be filled ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 , etc ) . while the top three states are possible in su(2 ) systems , 
 the lowest two require an su(4 ) symmetric internal degree of freedom . 
 the filled and empty arrows indicate the @xmath72-component of the spin @xmath91 and the pseudospin @xmath128 , respectively . 
 this construction remains valid when @xmath129 and @xmath130 replace @xmath91 and @xmath128 ( c.f . 
 ( [ newspin ] ) ) 
 . the top three states also occur in gaas ; the bottom three are new . ]    for @xmath131 , however , the su(4 ) internal degree of freedom allows new ground state candidates . 
 let @xmath132 denote a trial wave function that fills @xmath133 @xmath26 levels of the different single particle spin states . 
 as an example , fig . 
 [ example ] depicts all such states for @xmath134 . 
 ( for the monopole strength in finite spherical models , see eq . 
 ( [ mono ] ) below . ) which of these states will be the ground state will be determined only by detailed microscopic calculations ( to be described below ) . 
 a mean field approximation , which has been found to be successful for su(2 ) electrons @xcite , predicts that the state with the lowest  cf kinetic energy "" is the ground state . 
 this approximation , however , neglects the residual interaction between composite fermions , which favors the maximally polarized state due to exchange contribution . 
 table [ ground ] shows the angular momentum and the su(4 ) multiplet of the ground state in the @xmath135 landau levels at flux values given by @xmath136 where the @xmath132 state is a candidate for the ground state at @xmath121 with @xmath137 . 
 the following observations are consistent with the cf theory :    1 .   all ground states at the @xmath83 and @xmath64 values satisfying eq . 
 ( [ mono ] ) have rotational symmetry ( @xmath138 ) , consistent with the cf theory expectation of incompressibility for these parameters @xmath83 and @xmath67 . 
 these systems therefore are finite size representations of incompressible states at @xmath121 . 
 2 .   the filling @xmath23 corresponds to @xmath122 , a single filled @xmath26 level ( in one of the @xmath98 spin bands ) is the only candidate for an incompressible ground state ; the su(4 ) multiplet is @xmath123 $ ] , which is consistent with table [ ground ] . 
 the energy is identical to the su(2 ) case , but the multiplicity of the ground state is different ( @xmath139 ) . 
 analogous to @xmath7 , the ground state is a completely symmetric @xmath123 $ ] multiplet , which has associated with it a fully antisymmetric orbital wave function , in accordance with the pauli s principle . 
 this is the su(4 ) equivalent of the well - known ferromagnetic behavior in systems with quadratic dispersion relation ( gaas heterostructures and quantum wells ) in the vanishing zeeman energy limit . 
 unlike in the su(2 ) symmetric case , however , the spins are not necessarily aligned in the same direction ; in the @xmath123 $ ] multiplet spin and pseudospin are equal , but they can take all of the possible values@xcite : @xmath140 if @xmath83 is even , and @xmath141 if @xmath83 is odd . 
 ( the total multiplicity comes from these choices combined with the choice of @xmath128 and @xmath91 . ) 
 any weak perturbation that polarizes the spin should also polarize the pseudospin . 
 3 .   for @xmath124 
 , two @xmath26 levels are filled with particles of identical or different spin state ; the multiplet is @xmath123 $ ] or @xmath125 $ ] , respectively . 
 as the orbital part of the cf wave functions is identical to the su(2 ) case , it is no surprise that the latter is prefered in the absence of a symmetry - breaking field ( c.f .  the @xmath142 data in table [ ground ] ) . 
 ( the multiplicity of @xmath143 $ ] is @xmath144 . ) 
 the ground state energy is the same as in the su(2 ) symmetric case . in sec . 
 [ newstates ] it was shown that the maximal weight state is a product of two slater determinants just as for an su(2 ) singlet . because the su(2 ) systems already find the lowest energy state in this class , 
 the orbital part of the wave function remains the same . 
 however , the ground state is neither a spin nor a pseudospin singlet ; all spin @xmath145 and pseudospin @xmath146 combinations occur with @xmath147 for @xmath83 even , and @xmath148 for @xmath83 odd . 
 4 .   at @xmath149 and @xmath126 , 
 the @xmath12 ll ground state multiplets are consistent with three and four copies of completely filled lowest @xmath26 levels , respectively , consistent with the expectation from the mean - field model . 
 ( notice that @xmath150 $ ] and @xmath151 $ ] are conjugate representations to @xmath152 $ ] and @xmath153 $ ] , respectively , which can not be distinguished by their @xmath154 quantum numbers . ) the mean - field expectation is not borne out in the @xmath21 ll . in sec . 
 [ newstates ] , however , we have seen that new composite fermion ground states become possible at these fractions ; the small system calculations we can perform at @xmath149 and @xmath126 are unable to determine the true nature of the ground states at these fractions .

64,"central to a complete picture of galaxy evolution is the distribution of the interstellar matter ( ism ) within each galaxy and how that ism forms stars . given that the ism mass on galactic scales is dominated by molecular and atomic gas , observing the tracers of these gas components is necessary for measuring the ism distribution within the disks of spiral galaxies . 
 accordingly , observations of the hi 21-cm line and the co  @xmath9 2.6-mm line are often used as tracers of the atomic and molecular gas , respectively ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 while conversion of the velocity - integrated brightness temperature of the hi line , or @xmath10 , to atomic gas column density , @xmath11 , is usually straightforward ( though not always , e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ) , the conversion of i(co ) to molecular gas column density @xmath12 is not quite so certain ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 ? * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) , especially given that the co  @xmath9 line is known to be optically thick ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 recent observations @xcite suggest that the @xmath13 conversion factor , or x - factor , @xmath14 , is roughly constant within the disk of our galaxy , with @xmath15 , to be abbreviated as @xmath16 ; this or a similar value of @xmath14 is often called the `` standard '' value . 
 this uniform x - factor value for our galaxy s disk now applies to the disks of external galaxies , where @xmath17 is inferred and , on average , is _ radially _ non - varying from the inner disk to a galactocentric radius of @xmath18 @xcite . 
 the evidence for co - dark gas , both theoretically and observationally , is a further complication ( see , for example * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 it is thus advantageous to employ tracers other than co  @xmath9 as independent checks on ism surface density variations to test recent physical models of @xmath14 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * )    observed gas column and surface densities can then provide insights into large - scale star formation in galaxies . 
 the schmidt - kennicutt ( s - k ) law , for example , states that star formation rate surface density , @xmath19 , is related to the gas surface density , @xmath20 , by @xmath21 with @xmath22 to @xmath23 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 the index @xmath24 is appealing because the gas depletion time ( @xmath25 ) is constant thoughout the spiral disks . while there is some evidence that @xmath26 on size scales of @xmath27 ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) , there is also evidence of non - linear and even non - universal slopes on such size scales ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) , especially on the scales of individual giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) @xcite . 
 there is also strong evidence for an inside - out formation of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ) , which is at odds with a constant gas depletion time and , therefore , with having @xmath28 . 
 comparison between those results on the large ( i.e. , galactic ) scales with those on gmc scales is problematic . 
 @xcite suggest that the schmidt law on the scales of gmcs are fundamentally different from the s - k law apparent on larger ( i.e. galactic ) scales ; the latter are not the `` result of an underlying physical law of star formation . '' 
 many of the abovementioned results used observations of the optically thick co  @xmath9 line and adopted a spatially constant @xmath14 . 
 in contrast , millimetre ( mm ) , submillimetre ( submm ) , and far - infrared ( far - ir ) continuum observations sample optically thin continuum emission from the dust grains that pervade both the atomic and molecular gas . 
 recently , there have been many papers of the far - ir / submm continuum emission of external galaxies from the _ planck _ and _ herschel _ missions ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ?

 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 these papers find , for example , that the dust and stellar masses of galaxies are correlated @xcite and that spiral galaxies and dusty early type galaxies have @xmath29 to @xmath30 of dust @xcite . 
 a major stumbling block to determining accurate surface densities from dust continuum emission is the unknown mass absorption coefficient , @xmath31 , at millimetre wavelengths . 
 millimetre continuum emission is less temperature sensitive than that at submillimetre and far - ir wavelengths ; this provides an important constraint on dust mass and sometimes the spectral emissivity index , @xmath32 , can be constrained as well . 
 observationally , the relevant quantity determined is the dust optical depth to gas column density ratio , @xmath33 . 
 @xcite and @xcite have found that @xmath34 at 857@xmath0ghz ( wavelength of 350@xmath35 ) in the hi gas in the solar neighbourhood and @xmath36 at 250@xmath35 ( corresponding to @xmath37 at 857@xmath0ghz for @xmath38 ) in the hi gas in the taurus molecular complex . 
 given that @xmath38 applies to the dust in our galaxy ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ) and that the dust to _ hydrogen _ gas mass is about 0.01 , those observed @xmath33 correspond to @xmath39 to 0.5@xmath40 in the dust associated with hi . the dust associated with h@xmath41 , however , 
 has @xmath33 double that in hi @xcite . consequently , estimating @xmath33 and @xmath31 from comparing the observed dust continuum emission against the hi gas emission alone , while useful , must be viewed with caution . 
 the various estimates of @xmath31 suggest that determining the exact _ total _ mass of dust within a galaxy is uncertain by a factor of a few .    in spite of the uncertain dust mass absorption coefficient 
 , dust continuum emission can provide estimates of @xmath14 in our galaxy as well as in external galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 such observations have shown that while @xmath14 can be more or less spatially constant in some cases , like in the disk of our galaxy and other external galaxies ( see * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) , there can be regions of `` dark '' gas , h@xmath41 with no co emission , both in our galaxy and other galaxies ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 therefore , observations of dust continuum emission provide a vital check on results inferred from co  @xmath9 observations . 
 even with the many recent advances mentioned above , there are many questions left unanswered . for example , do the inferred x - factor values ( i.e. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) apply to the outer disks of all galaxies ? also , are there systematic differences of the x - factor between arm and inter - arm regions ? can previous methods of observationally inferring the dust mass absorption coefficient at millimetre wavelengths be refined ? how do the answers to those questions influence the specific form of the observed s - k law in a given galaxy ?    to address these questions and to better understand the gas and dust in spiral galaxies and their relationship to star formation , we observed the grand - design , face - on spiral galaxies m@xmath051  and m@xmath083with the bolometer - array camera , _ aztec _ ( aztronomical thermal emission camera ) , mounted on the 15-m jcmt in hawaii at a wavelength of 1.1@xmath0 mm . 
 both of these galaxies are nearby with distances of less than 10@xmath0mpc ( see table  [ tab1 ] for details ) and , hence , the spiral arms in both galaxies are resolved across the arms in the _ jcmt / aztec _ observations , which have a spatial resolution of 20@xmath42 . 
 both galaxies have been studied extensively at numerous wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ?

 recent _ herschel _ observations of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  at 70 , 160 , 250 , 350 , and 500@xmath35 have provided maps of the dust temperature , surface density , and even spectral emissivity index , @xmath32 @xcite , but with spatial coverage that is slightly more limited than those of the _ aztec _ 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum maps presented here ; the _ aztec _ images cover a few more kiloparsecs at the adopted distances given in table  [ tab1 ] . as a result , 
 these _ aztec _ 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum images extend both the spatial and the wavelength coverage of the dust emission in both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . 
 this greater spatial coverage placed restrictions on the other wavelengths available for comparison with the _ aztec _ 1.1@xmath0 mm data ; there were no 250 , 350 , and 500@xmath35 data towards the outer disks of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . 
 there are , however , _ spitzer _ 
 160@xmath35 data covering both of these galaxies . 
 this wavelength is the longest of the _ spitzer _ data and , along with the _ aztec _ 1.1@xmath0 mm data , is the one most likely associated with the dust component(s ) that dominate the mass of the dust . in addition , the surface densities in the current work were estimated from the observational data . specifically , @xmath33 at @xmath43 was inferred by comparison with the hi column densities and removing upper outliers , because these upper outliers were assumed to represent positions with co - dark gas . 
 this approach has the advantage that final gas masses inferred were not dependent on dust models .

 @xmath48 the star formation surface density map normalized to the molecular gas surface density determined from the co @xmath9 line and the x - factor . 
 maps of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  were made in the 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum from observations with the instrument _ aztec _ with the _ jcmt_. combining with these maps with the corresponding _ spitzer _ 160@xmath35 ( or , more properly , 155.9@xmath35 ) maps gave estimates of the gas surface densities in these two galaxies ( see appendix  [ appsurf ] and [ appgsdm ] for a detailed discussion ) . 
 with these gas surface density maps , spatial variations of the x - factor were estimated . 
 in addition , we investigated the relationship between the gas surface density and that of the star formation rate . 
 these are dealt with in more detail below . 
 the most important results of this work regarding the x - factor are the following :    1 . 
 the average x - factor for each galaxy can be estimated from the current observations , even if crudely . 
 those average values are @xmath49 and @xmath50 for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 , respectively . 
 2 .   the x - factor is higher in the interarm regions than in the arms . 
 3 .   there seems to be co - dark gas that resides mostly in the outer disks of both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . 
 the latter two results are robust to a range of adopted @xmath33 values . 
 the variation of the x - factor spatially and from source to source could be due , in part , to variations in metallicity . 
 theoretical work using the observational data also support a dependence of @xmath14 on metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 in contrast , @xcite do not find a strong correlation of @xmath14 with metallicity . 
 however , their sample only had a metallicity range of 0.5 - 0.8 dex within factors of  3 of solar . 
 the irregular galaxies observed by israel and others ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 ? * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) typically had metallicities much less than solar , sometimes only a few percent of solar , and found x - factors an order - of - magnitude or more higher than the standard value . 
 so a strong @xmath14-metallicity relation may exist for galaxies with strongly sub - solar metallicities . 
 for galaxies with roughly solar metallicities , while metallicity alone is apparently insufficient in constraining @xmath14 , it is still relevant . 
 for example , using the data points for ngc4321 from the left panel of figure  10 in @xcite yields a correlation coeffient of @xmath510.6 . 
 this suggests that each galaxy has its own @xmath14-metallicity relationship . 
 given that sub - solar metallicities imply larger x - factors , perhaps the interarm regions of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  have sub - solar metallicities , while being at solar - level in their arms.51 . 
 whether this implies the same metallicity in both regions is unclear . 
 ] the models of @xcite , as well as their figure  1 , suggest that the metallicity in the interarm regions would be systematically lower by a factor of @xmath522 - 3 in order to increase @xmath14 by a factor of 2 with respect to that in the spiral arms ( see their equation  # 8) . while observations of metallicity in the ism of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  apparently do not support such a systemically lower metallicity between their spiral arms ( see * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) , they also do not rule it out : such observations are toward hii regions and are heavily biased toward the spiral arms . 
 this could , in turn , affect the results of studies of the effects of the spiral arms on star formation . 
 @xcite , for example , looked at whether the sfr normalized to the molecular gas surface density is higher in the spiral arms of three galaxies . 
 they adopted a spatially constant x - factor , which , to within a factor of 2 , is likely correct . 
 this will be discussed further in section  [ sfrgsd ] . 
 the modelling by @xcite mentioned above suggests that the x - factor depends mainly on the metallicity of the gas in a galaxy and , to a lesser extent , on the average co surface brightness . 
 using the roughly solar metallicities of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  ( see * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) , the observed co brightnesses from the data used here , and applying expression  ( 8) of @xcite yields @xmath53 for m@xmath051  and @xmath54 to 6@xmath55 for m@xmath083 ; this is much higher than the observed values found in the current work . 
 admittedly , our estimates are uncertain by factors of about 2 . 
 nevertheless , our estimate of @xmath56 for m@xmath051  agrees with the result of @xcite who find @xmath57 from using the observed extinction in hii regions . 
 accordingly , the theoretical models need further adjustments . 
 as mentioned previously , there is evidence that adopting a spatially constant x - factor does not account for co - dark gas . 
 for example , table  [ tab3 ] suggests that about half the total gas mass is unaccounted for when using the co  @xmath9 and hi  21-cm spectral lines ( see section  [ xfac ] and appendix  [ appgsdm ] ) . if we adopt a threshold for co - dark gas that corresponds to an @xmath14 that is a factor of 4 higher than the average for each galaxy , then some of the edges of the shaded regions of figures  [ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] indicate such gas . 
 it is worth noting that these edges are well within the boundaries of the co maps . 
 of course , possible alternative interpretations for the high x - factor or its high lower limits are not entirely ruled out . 
 these include the following :    * an extended low surface brightness artifact in the 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum maps of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . * insufficient mapping of co  @xmath9 in the outer disks of these galaxies . * dust with unusual properties such as unusually high dust - mass absorption coefficient ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) and/or a high dust - to - gas mass ratio . * optically thick hi 21-cm emission 
 each of the above could mimic the presence of co - dark gas . 
 the first alternative is unlikely given that the simulations of the _ aztec _ 1.1@xmath0 mm observations have accurately accounted for any constant offsets in the m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  maps . 
 the second alternative is unlikely because there is evidence for such co - dark gas seen at radii well within the boundaries of the existing co maps , as mentioned previously . 
 the third alternative is unlikely because having a combination of high @xmath31 and high @xmath58 would not be sufficient for positions with @xmath14 two orders of magnitude larger . 
 the fourth alternative is a partly valid explanation for co - dark gas in our galaxy according to the @xcite . 
 they estimated that up to half of the dark gas could be due to optically thick hi 21-cm emission . even if that were the case for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 
 , it would not account for lower limits to @xmath14 that are one or two orders of magnitude higher than the average inner disk value .    in short , 
 none of the alternatives mentioned above are likely to entirely rule out co - dark gas . 
 nevertheless , these alternatives themselves are _ not _ entirely ruled out either and could partly account for some of the high x - factor values inferred . in any event , 
 _ more and deeper mapping of co and other gas tracers of the outer disks of these galaxies is essential for understanding the nature of the dust and gas at these large galactocentric radii . _ 
 the existence of co - dark gas in our galaxy has been known for a while ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and has been confirmed recently by the @xcite . 
 they find @xmath59 for our galaxy . 
 also , as mentioned previously there is much additional evidence for such gas in the galaxy and external galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 so it is quite likely that there is co - dark gas in both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . 
 indeed , the current observations suggest that such gas is present in the outer disks of both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 
 . the co - dark gas could account for as much as half of the total gas mass , although the alternative interpretations given above could reduce that fraction by roughly 50% .      in section  [ sfvgsd ] 
 , we examined how the sfr varied with the gas surface density in a number of ways . 
 comparing between the continuum and spectral line tracers given in figure  [ fig18 ] , all show higher slopes for the continuum tracers than for the spectral - line tracers . 
 figures  [ fig5a ] and [ fig6a ] illustrate that the continuum - derived radial profile of the gas surface density is flatter than that for the spectral - line derived gas surface for large galactocentric radii . having a smaller range of gas surface densities 
 will naturally increase the slope in the sfr versus gas surface density plots .    even though @xcite used far - uv and 24@xmath35 data to estimate the sfr , whereas we used h@xmath60 and 24@xmath35 , 
 that is unlikely to account for the difference between their fitted slopes and ours ; their figure  9 makes such a comparison and the difference in fitted slopes between the two sfr tracers is 10% or less . 
 so if differences in sfr tracers can not explain the difference between the slope obtained by @xcite and those obtained in the current work , then it must be the difference in gas surface density tracer . 
 the continuum tracer used here gives slopes of @xmath61 , which is consistent with the eyeball inspection of the far upper right panel of figure  8 of @xcite for the inner @xmath62 radius of m@xmath083 . 
 estimation of gas surface or column densities is problematic because , as exemplified in the current work , different tracers can yield different results . 
 there are systematics that affect the column density estimates using co  @xmath9 and different systematics when using infrared and millimetre continuum . 
 these systematics yield the differing slopes and also the observed scatter , which is sometimes quite large with _ reduced _ chi - square as high as @xmath63 to 70 . 
 this scatter is partly intrinsic , because the sfr depends on more physical conditions than on just column density . but 
 systematic errors in estimating surface densities also play a role . 
 corrections applied systematically to those errors would represent a smooth gradient with galactocentric radius and not simply corrections to a few individual points . 
 for example , observations have inferred x - factor values that are factors of about 5 or more lower than the standard value ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) in the centres of external galaxies as well as in the central region of our own galaxy @xcite . 
 but these centres only represent the central few hundred parsec radii and would thus represent very few points in the plots of figure  [ fig18 ] . only a large , smooth gradient in parameters like the x - factor or 
 @xmath33 would change the slope uniformly in those plots , and there is no evidence for such . 
 nevertheless , there is evidence of a weak dependence of the x - factor on the sfr . 
 @xcite explored this possibility with their physical models of molecular clouds , finding that @xmath64 with @xmath65 . 
 the systematically different power - law indices for the dust tracers from those for the gas tracers are reconcilable by adopting that relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath19 . 
 the computation of appendix  [ appxfsfr ] yields @xmath66 and @xmath67 for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 , respectively . 
 these have uncertainties of 3 - 4% and are thus significantly different from that of the models of @xcite . 
 these are more consistent with the models of @xcite(see * ? ? ? 
 * ) . that the m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  @xmath68 values are significantly different from each other argues that there is no universal relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath19 . 
 this is not surprising given that both of those quantities have complex dependences on the physical structure within the molecular gas . 
 the value of the slope of the surface densities of sfr versus those of the molecular gas is an indication of the large - scale evolution of a galaxy . as briefly alluded to previously , following 
 the `` stream '' of points in each of the panels of figure  [ fig18 ] from low to high surface densities is equivalent to travelling from large to small galactocentric radii . 
 the @xmath69 ( or alternatively @xmath70 $ ] ) ratio is really the inverse depletion time of the molecular gas . for slope @xmath71 , @xmath72 and the gas 
 is depleted uniformly throughout a galaxy , as pointed out by @xcite and found by them and @xcite 
 . however , _ all _ the panels of figure  [ fig18 ] have slopes @xmath73 , strongly supporting an inside - out depletion of molecular gas in both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . 
 the panels of figures  [ fig19 ] and [ fig20 ] yield molecular gas depletion times from their centres out to radii of about 8@xmath0kpc for m@xmath051  and 6@xmath0kpc for m@xmath083 . for m@xmath051 , 
 the continuum tracers give molecular gas depletion times of about 1.2@xmath0gyr in the centre to 20@xmath0gyr in the outer disk and , with the co line tracer , these times are 0.8 to 2.5@xmath0gyr . 
 for m@xmath083 , the continuum tracers suggest depletion times of about 0.7@xmath0gyr in the centre to 10@xmath0gyr in the outer disk and , again for co , these times are about 0.4 to 5@xmath0gyr . 
 this inside - out evolution of the star formation in the disks of galaxies is supported by the visible - light observations of @xcite .    at radii from about 8@xmath0kpc to 11@xmath0kpc for m@xmath051 , the molecular gas depletion times at these radii extend by nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the 20@xmath0gyr estimate for galactocentric radius of 8@xmath0kpc . for m@xmath083 
 , this extension of the gas depletion time occurs for radii slightly beyond 6@xmath0kpc and is by about 1.5 orders of magnitude . 
 figures  [ fig19 ] and [ fig20 ] are equivalent to figure  5 of @xcite , displaying the inverse depletion times of the molecular gas in the form of images of entire galaxies . those images in the current paper ( and , to some extent , those of * ? ? ? 
 * ) are suggestive of spiral structure . 
 such spiral structure implies an enhancement of the sfr due to the spiral arms beyond that of arms simply collecting and compressing gas and dust . 
 accordingly , we subjected these images to spiral arm fourier analysis and found only a weak spiral structure with arm / interarm ratios usually within factors of 2 of unity . 
 the right panels were found to have a spiral structure with high _ interarm _ values of @xmath69 and lower arm values , which is corrected when accounting for the higher interarm @xmath14 ( see section  [ xfac ] ) . in contrast , the left panels were found to have a spiral structure with high @xmath74 $ ] on the arms and lower values between the arms ; the arm / interarm ratios are 1.3 for m@xmath051  and 2.0 for m@xmath083 . 
 these arm / interarm ratios are at least partly explained by the higher @xmath33 between the arms than in the arms ( see appendix  [ appgsdm]) 18% higher for m@xmath051  and 8% higher for m@xmath083 . 
 so , conservatively speaking , even the continuum tracer in our work _ confirms the work of @xcite that spiral arms only enhance the star formation rate because of increasing the surface density of gas and dust with _ no _ additional enhancement . 
 _ the uncertainties in the current work do not permit completely ruling out such an enhancement , but suggest that any such enhancement would be small ( i.e. , a factor of @xmath75 ) . 
 that enhancement , should it be real , could be accounted for by orbit - crowding in the spiral arms raising the inverse depletion time of the gas in those arms ( e.g. * ? ? 
 one key question is whether the conclusions are still valid if the diffuse emission is removed @xcite . 
 but the lower spatial resolution of the gas tracer observations impede determination of the surface densities associated only with the star - forming regions . 
 so a surface - density versus surface - density plot is difficult to create ( see * ? ? ? 
 * ) , making comparison in the context of much previous work difficult . removing the diffuse emission _ might _ still result in the slope of the @xmath76 versus @xmath77 still being higher when a dust - continuum tracer is used in place of a gas - line tracer ( see figure  [ fig18 ] ) , due to the co - dark gas not traced by spectral lines or maybe due to @xmath14 varying with the sfr . also , the inside - out galactic - scale evolution of star formation , as indicated by the superlinear slopes , is likely still valid due to the support of independent work @xcite . 
 @xcite use hierarchical bayesian linear regression on the observational data , finding that no one s - k relation holds for all galaxies . 
 this is consistent with the current work where no one power - law applies to either m@xmath051  or m@xmath083 . 
 indeed , any simple power - law fit is inapplicable given the poor quality of fits in figure  [ fig18 ] . 
 not only are there different slopes in different galaxies , but there are also different offsets , particularly in post - starburst galaxies ( see * ? ? ? 
 , if no one such relation holds for all galaxies , then the s - k relation does not represent a universal physical law of star formation ( see * ? ? ? 
 perhaps the s - k relation for a disk galaxy is a measure of how the inverse depletion time of the molecular gas varies radially in that disk galaxy ( e.g. , inside - out or outside - in star formation ) , which , in turn , is affected by the many properties of , and processes in , the disk of that particular galaxy ( see , for example * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ?

 the spiral galaxies m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  were observed with the bolometer array _ 
 aztec _ on the _ jcmt _ in the 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum at 20@xmath42 spatial resolution . 
 the extended emission , including the interarm emission and exponential disks , was faithfully recovered in the final maps out to galactocentric radii of more than 12@xmath0kpc for both galaxies . 
 this was verified by simulations that show that only small corrections are necessary for the m@xmath051  image and negligible corrections for that of m@xmath083 . 
 the 1.1@xmath0mm - continuum fluxes are @xmath2 and @xmath3 for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 , respectively . 
 the uncertainties are largely due to that of the calibration . 
 these images were combined with the 160@xmath35 image of _ spitzer _ to obtain dust temperatures and column densities . 
 this approach was adopted , rather than using dust models , for two reasons . 
 one reason was to have an independent test of the models ( see * ? ? ? * ) . 
 the other reason is that multi - wavelength far - ir data at the long wavelengths ( i.e. @xmath78 ) at which the bulk of the dust mass radiates is not available for the outer disks of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 , other than the 160@xmath35 data of _ 
 spitzer_.    another model - independent approach was to constrain , at least roughly , the @xmath33 at 1.1@xmath0 mm by the observations , rather than simply adopting a dust mass absorption coefficient , @xmath79 . 
 gas column densities were estimated by calibrating against hi - dominant positions to estimate the dust optical depth to gas column density ratio @xmath33 . 
 the method of calibrating against the hi - dominant positions was improved by crudely estimating the effects of the co - dark gas ( see below ) . 
 neither galaxy has a strong radial variation in the gas surface density beyond galactocentric radii of about 3@xmath0kpc . 
 out to a galactocentric radius of 14@xmath0kpc , the best estimate of the mass of gas in m@xmath051  is @xmath4 . out to 12@xmath0kpc in m@xmath083 , this best estimate is @xmath5 . 
 ( see adopted distances in table  [ tab1 ] . ) 
 pre - existing maps of co  @xmath9 permitted the creation of maps of the @xmath6 or x - factor for both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083out to galactocentric radii of 6 - 8@xmath0kpc . both galaxies have x - factor values that are higher in the _ inter_arm than in the arms by a factor of @xmath7 - 2 . in the central few kiloparsecs of m@xmath051 , 
 this interarm / arm ratio rises to @xmath80 . in m@xmath051 
 , there is no significant radial variation of @xmath14 . in m@xmath083 , however , there is evidence at the many-@xmath81 level of radial variation of the x - factor by factors of 2 to 3 , where the central 2@xmath0kpc radius has a roughly flat x - factor which declines to a minimum at about 4@xmath0kpc . within galactocentric 
 radii @xmath82 - 8@xmath0kpc , the spatially averaged x - factor is about 1@xmath55 . 
 beyond the outer radius of the x - factor map for each galaxy , comparison of the radial profile of the gas surface density derived from the continuum with those of the surface brightnesses of co and hi permits estimates of lower limits of the x - factor that reach one to two orders of magnitude higher than the inner disk values . 
 this suggests the existence of co - dark molecular gas in the outer disks of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 , although alternative explanations are only partly ruled out . 
 nevertheless , these alternatives do not entirely account for the high x - factor values in the outer disk 
 . a two - dimensional fourier analysis of the spiral structure at 1.1@xmath0 mm and at visible ( or near visible ) wavelengths revealed that the spiral structure in red light and that in the 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum and were the same in m@xmath051 . 
 for m@xmath083 , the spiral structure in @xmath46-band compared with that in the 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum showed that the bar s effect in m@xmath083  is conspicuous in @xmath46-band and not at 1.1@xmath0 mm . 
 these results suggest that the spiral density wave in m@xmath051  is influencing the interstellar medium and stars similarly , while the bar potential in m@xmath083  has a different influence on the interstellar medium from that on the stars . 
 log - log plots of the star formation rate surface densities against those of the gas traced by spectral lines ( i.e. , of hi and co ) had slopes of @xmath7 whether total gas or just molecular gas surface density . for the plots with gas surface densities traced by the continuum emission , 
 the slopes were @xmath61 whether total gas ( using continuum only ) or just molecular ( using continuum with hi subtracted ) gas surface densities . 
 these plots , especially with the continuum tracers , show a threshold gas surface density at which the sfr rises by two or more orders of magnitude . 
 the existence of this threshold gas surface density is insensitive to within a factor of @xmath523 for the adopted @xmath33 . 
 the value of this threshold density is @xmath83 . 
 this threshold is somewhat less conspicuous in the spectral line tracers than for the continuum tracers . 
 the fitted slopes suggest that the depletion of the molecular gas occurs first at small galactocentric radii and then at increasing radii in an inside - out galactic evolution . 
 this is seen more clearly in maps of the ratio of the surface densities of the sfr to that of the molecular gas . 
 for both these galaxies and the continuum tracer , the molecular gas depletion time in the centres is about 1@xmath0gyr , rising at radii of 6 - 8@xmath0kpc to around 10 - 20@xmath0gyr . 
 further out , the depletion times rise by one or two orders of magnitude . 
 the spectral line tracer , i.e. co  @xmath9 , suggests molecular gas depletion times in the outer disks that are appreciably less than 10 - 20@xmath0gyr . 
 the images of the inverse depletion time show signs of spiral structure . superficially 
 , this suggests that spiral arms effect the sfr beyond just heightening the gas surface density . 
 however , correcting for the x - factor spatial variation and for the spatial variation of the @xmath33 removes or nearly removes such spiral structure . 
 this apparently confirms the result of @xcite that the arms merely heighten the sfr in the same proportion as they heighten the gas surface density . 
 greater spatial resolution is required for confirming this result . 
 in the future , we need deeper mapping of molecular tracers in the outer disks of these spiral galaxies . as well , a better method of calibrating the @xmath33 at millimetre wavelengths is needed . 
 so far , the method employed in the current work is functional , but only crudely . 
 either a new method or refinement of the method described here is necessary . 
 consultations with rich rand , divakara mayya , daniel rosa are greatly appreciated . 
 we also thank the anonymous referee , whose comments noticeably improved the manuscript .

 the outer edge to the 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum emission of m@xmath051  lies at a galactocentric radius of about 14@xmath0kpc and for m@xmath083  it is about 12@xmath0kpc . 
 the derived fluxes are @xmath84 for m@xmath051  and @xmath85 for m@xmath083  to those outer edges . 
 the uncertainties include the calibration uncertainty of 13% and the uncertainties due to the somewhat arbitrary choices for outer boundaries . 
 the simulations were used to check for systematics in the flux determination , thereby providing correction factors for the derived fluxes . for m@xmath051 , this correction factor was 1.5 for m@xmath051  and 0.9 for m@xmath083 . 
 these corrections were included in the previously quoted flux values . 
 the 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum surface - brightness maps of figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] were ratioed with the _ spitzer / mips _ 160@xmath35 , effectively 155.9@xmath35 , maps of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  @xcite to produce temperature maps under the assumption that the dust emissivity index , @xmath32 , was 2.0 . 
 as stated in the introduction , this was the most appropriate value for @xmath32 as found from the observations of @xmath86 by @xcite . 
 _ in practice , the adopted value for @xmath32 will have only a small effect on the derived gas column densities , provided that those derived column densities are calibrated against observed gas column densities . _ by using those positions where atomic gas dominated the column densities to calibrate the @xmath33 for the continuum - derived column densities , it was found that the column densities derived from the continuum data for @xmath87 to 2.5 did not deviate by more than 30% from those for @xmath88 . 
 consequently , observations at only two wavelengths are necessary for a reasonable approximation of the gas surface density map . 
 the @xmath33 derived from the hi comparisons are 2.2-@xmath89 for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 , respectively . these values lead to gas mass estimates that appear to be too low ( see sections  [ xfac ] , [ xfsv ] , and below in this appendix for details ) . 
 @xcite simply adopted the dust mass - absorption coefficient of @xcite and @xcite , which is a factor of @xmath90 smaller than the values determined here . 
 @xcite also determined a higher dust - to - gas mass ratio than that adopted here . 
 this is equivalent to adopting a @xmath33 that is factors of 5.0 - 5.3 smaller than that derived from the hi comparisons . 
 because we adopt a constant dust - to - gas ratio , the two @xmath33 cases are referred to as the high-@xmath31 ( from hi comparisons ) and low-@xmath31 @xcite cases . 
 given the low masses that result from the high-@xmath31 case , the hi comparisons must be appropriately modified . 
 the hi comparisons were repeated after removing upper outliers that are apparently unreliable due to possible undetected gas . 
 this results in an intermediate case , where a @xmath33 that is a factor of two lower than that from the simple atomic gas calibration method is found . unless otherwise stated , all masses and surface densities quoted are for this intermediate-@xmath33 ( most realistic ) case . 
 this approach yields a roughly 50% uncertainty in column density and mass estimates , using @xmath91 . 
 the surface brightness at frequency @xmath92 , @xmath93 , is related to the dust - derived gas column density , @xmath94 , by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the mean atomic weight per hydrogen atom , @xmath97 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , @xmath58 is the dust - to - gas mass ratio , and @xmath31 is the dust mass absorption coefficient . 
 the mass - absorption coefficient varies with frequency as follows : @xmath98 in which @xmath99 is dust mass - absorption coefficient at a reference frequency @xmath100 . 
 the dust temperature , @xmath101 , is of course estimated by evaluating expression  ( [ eq1 ] ) at frequency @xmath102 , corresponding to the wavelength of 1.1@xmath0 mm for the _ jcmt / aztec _ observations , and again at frequency @xmath103 , corresponding to the wavelength of 155.9@xmath35 for the _ spitzer / mips _ observations , and taking the ratio of the two . as well as using the maps at the two wavelengths ( i.e. the _ jcmt / aztec _ at 1.1@xmath0 mm and the _ spitzer / mips _ map at 155.9@xmath35 ) , there are many additional details involved in estimating the column densities , @xmath94 . 
 these include estimating the value of @xmath33 ( or the product of @xmath58 and @xmath31 ) , convolving the _ aztec _ 
 1.1@xmath0 mm map to the resolution of the _ spitzer / mips _ 155.9@xmath35 map , estimating the noise levels in the maps , characterizing any systematic effects introduced into the @xmath101 and @xmath94 maps due to the observations and processing of the _ aztec _ data , and any relevant colour corrections to the continuum data . in particular , a constant offset correction of @xmath104-@xmath105 must be added to the column densities for m@xmath051  as dictated by the simulations to correct for inadequately recovering the large - scale emission ( but was not applied to the figures ) . 
 there are a couple issues that should be addressed in discussing the reliability of gas surface densities and masses as inferred from dust emission in the current work . 
 one issue is to what level calibration differences between that of _ spitzer / mips _ and that of _ herschel / pacs _ for their 160@xmath35 data would affect the results and conclusions of the current work ( see * ? ? ? 
 another issue is the validity of the simple approach used here instead of using a more detailed dust model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 as for the former issue , @xcite compared the 160@xmath35 data for both instruments and characterized their systematic differences . 
 depending on the calibration scheme used , the _ herschel / pacs _ 160@xmath35 intensities were either 1.6% or 25% systematically higher than those for _ 
 spitzer / mips_. scaling up the 160@xmath35 intensities used in the current work by 25% would increase the computed dust temperatures , but by differing amounts depending on initial computed temperature . 
 most of the those temperatures were determined to be between 10@xmath0k and 23@xmath0k . 
 after the hypothetical correction , those would be 10.3@xmath0k and 25@xmath0k . 
 if there were no calibration of the column densities against other data , those corrected temperatures would require the column densities to be corrected downwards by 5% and 11% , respectively . 
 the warmer positions in both galaxies tend to have higher column densities . 
 so the higher column densities would be corrected downwards by more than the lower column densities , on average . 
 this reduces the dynamic range of the determined column densities by roughly 6% . 
 the overall scaling of those column densities would remain unchanged because of the calibration against hi column densities . 
 so , such a correction , were it necessary , would not appreciably change the current results .    as for the second issue 
 , the models of @xcite combined with data at mid - ir and far - ir wavelengths can provide estimates of a number of parameters . 
 for the current work , however , there are two reasons why such an approach was not used . 
 one reason is that , as mentioned in the introduction , the _ aztec _ 
 1.1@xmath0 mm map has more spatial coverage than the _ herschel _ data for both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . _ 
 spitzer _ does have sufficient spatial coverage for comparison with the _ aztec _ data , but does not have the long - wavelength data that probes the bulk of the dust mass , other than at 160@xmath35 . 
 so , to consistently treat each entire galaxy , the _ aztec _ 
 1.1@xmath0 mm data were combined with the _ spitzer _ 160@xmath35 data for both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . 
 another reason that the more model - dependent approach was not used is that we need to have model - independent tests that can confirm or refute the validity of the models , as stated recently by @xcite . 
 the current work , for example , finds a dust opacity to gas column density ratio @xmath33 at 1.1@xmath0 mm that is about double that inferred from @xcite . 
 but temporarily adopting the @xmath33 of @xcite and adopting the appropriate distance yields nearly identical masses for both the more sophistocated approach ( i.e. , in * ? ? ? 
 * ) and the simpler approach ( i.e. , the current work ) for the ngc@xmath05194 field . 
 this strongly suggests that the simpler approach of the current work is reasonable at recovering some basic dust properties . 
 the dust optical depth to gas column density ratio , @xmath33 , and especially the dust mass absorption coeffient , @xmath31 , can be quite uncertain , ranging from @xmath106 to @xmath107 . 
 ( see the following for examples of disparate values : * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) . accordingly , 
 attempting to measure @xmath33 observationally could narrow the uncertainty . 
 this is most easily observed in gas dominated by atomic hydrogen because the gas column densities are easy to determine . 
 another approach was followed by @xcite for observations of the galaxies m@xmath099 and m@xmath0100 in which they plotted the star formation rate surface density , @xmath19 , against gas surface density and against that for dust , adjusting the @xmath31 until both surface densities agree at large @xmath19 . 
 this resulted in a @xmath31 value corresponding to the unusually low @xmath108 mentioned above . 
 the large @xmath33 initially derived in the current work was from comparing the observed optical depths at 1.1@xmath0 mm with the observed gas column densities in regions dominated by atomic gas . 
 the @xcite observed @xmath34 at 857@xmath0ghz and @xmath36 at 250@xmath35 in the dust associated with the hi gas within the galaxy . 
 the @xcite also observed @xmath109 at 250@xmath35 for the dust associated with molecular gas , which is about double that observed for dust associated with atomic gas , remembering that the @xmath110 is the column density of hydrogen _ 
 nuclei_. at a wavelength of 1.1@xmath0 mm , these numbers correspond to @xmath111 and @xmath112 for dust associated with hi and @xmath113 for that associated with h@xmath41 ( using a spectral emissivity index of @xmath38 for the galaxy , e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 the current work initially finds @xmath114 for m@xmath051  and @xmath115 for m@xmath083  for dust along lines of sight with gas column densities dominated by @xmath116 . 
 this is more than double the values observed in our galaxy and are even 40% larger than the dust associated with @xmath117 in our galaxy . 
 this large @xmath33 is suspect and requires a re - evaluation of the calibration of @xmath33 at 1.1@xmath0 mm . 
 one explanation for the observed large @xmath33 would be co - dark gas . the presence of such gas can be crudely tested . 
 this is done by starting with dust - derived gas column densities , @xmath94 , that are only roughly calibrated 
 i.e. , to within a factor of a few . 
 the difference @xmath118 then provides a rough measure of molecular gas column density . 
 the ratio @xmath119 ( where the @xmath14 is the average used for each galaxy ) is a crude measure of the amount of dark gas  a _ dark _ ratio . 
 then @xmath33 can be recomputed using only those positions with dark ratios less than some upper limit . choosing a dark ratio upper limit as high as 100 reduces the derived @xmath33 by a few percent , while choosing unity yields a @xmath33 that is a factor of about 4 lower . 
 the latter is risky given that this could unnecessarily exclude too many positions with very little dark gas . 
 accordingly , a more conservative correction factor would be around 2 .    reducing the @xmath33 value by this factor scales up the column densities by the same factor and the x - factor scales in proportion to @xmath118 , or up by a factor of @xmath523 for both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . 
 the best estimates of these values are hence @xmath120 , corresponding to @xmath121 for @xmath122 for both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . 
 these are well within a factor of 2 of the values found by the @xcite for our galaxy . 
 the best estimates for the x - factors for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  are around 1@xmath55 . 
 table  [ tab3 ] displays the best estimated values for the gas masses and the x - factors . 
 that table shows that roughly half of the total mass of the gas is unaccounted for using spectral lines . 
 this is discussed further in section  [ xfsv ] . 
 possible spatial variations in @xmath33 should also be considered . 
 both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  show _ 
 de_creases in @xmath33 by about 15 - 20% in going from galactocentric radii of 1 or 2@xmath0kpc to about 6 or 7@xmath0kpc . correcting for the co - dark gas changes this result . 
 the problem is that the numbers of points used in the comparisons becomes very small ( i.e. @xmath123 ) when the upper limit to the dark ratio is reduced . 
 such small numbers do not give reliable estimates of @xmath33 . 
 so the radial spatial variation of @xmath33 is uncertain , although there is no clear evidence that it has a strong radial variation . in going from interarm positions to spiral arm positions , the @xmath33 in m@xmath051  decreases by 18% . in m@xmath083 
 , this decrease is 8% . 
 again , correcting for the co - dark gas changes these results to 25% for m@xmath051  and an 11% _ in_crease for m@xmath083 , although the number of points available for the estimation is not really sufficient . 
 the x - factor , @xmath14 , can be straightforwardly computed from @xmath124 given that @xmath94 , @xmath11 , and @xmath125 are all maps , @xmath14 is also a map , but not a very extended map because of the mounting uncertainties that result from the numerous computations with pre - existing data required to reach @xmath14 . 
 both the m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  @xmath14 maps do not extend beyond about 7@xmath0kpc from the centre of each map , mostly because the co maps do not extend further than that . 
 figures  [ fig13 ] , [ fig13a ] , [ fig14 ] , and [ fig14a ] show the x - factor maps and radial profiles for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . 
 the mean values of the x - factor listed in table  [ tab5 ] , which we call @xmath126 , are the @xmath127-weighted means of each @xmath14 map and only really applies to the central 7@xmath0kpc radius in each galaxy . 
 given that the co  @xmath9 emission falls to the noise level at a radius of about 7 to 8@xmath0kpc , we are unable to compute @xmath14 beyond that in the outer disks . 
 nevertheless , we can use the radial curves of figures  [ fig5a ] and [ fig6a ] to infer rough lower limits on @xmath14 in the outer disks . 
 the radial variation of @xmath14 with respect to the mean value in the inner disk , @xmath126 , is a simple variation on expression  ( [ eq5 ] ) : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the molecular gas column density estimated from a spatially constant x - factor : @xmath130 . 
 this measure of the column density is very noisy in these observations of the outer disks and a useful proxy is necessary for inferring some crude lower limit on @xmath131 for radii beyond 8@xmath0kpc . 
 the proxy adopted for @xmath132 was a pessimistic estimate of the 3-sigma uncertainties of the gas column density , i.e. , @xmath133 $ ] . 
 this gives the most conservative ( i.e. least extreme ) estimates for @xmath131 beyond a radius of 8@xmath0kpc . 
 for m@xmath051 , even in the high-@xmath31 ( low-@xmath31 ) case , the above proxy yields lower limits to @xmath14 of roughly @xmath134 to @xmath135 ( @xmath136 to @xmath137 ) depending on the radius in the outer disk . for m@xmath083 , even in the high-@xmath31 ( low-@xmath31 ) case , these rough lower limits to @xmath14 are @xmath138 to @xmath139 ( @xmath140 to @xmath141 ) . 
 the logarithm of the sfr surface density is plotted against that of the gas surface density for different tracers of that gas surface density . 
 the plots of the surface densities of sfr versus gas are displayed in figure  [ fig18 ] . 
 the uncertainty of each fitted slope is the formal error of the fit and was scaled by the square - root of the reduced chi - square in order to give a more conservative and more realistic estimate of this formal error . 
 one important consideration in these fits is that the spatial resolution of the m@xmath051  data is limited to 38@xmath42 , because of the _ spitzer _ 160@xmath35 resolution . for m@xmath083 
 this resolution is 55@xmath42 resolution due to the co observations . given that each point in these plots represents a single pixel , the effective number of independent points in each plot is the number of pixels divided by 20 for m@xmath051  and by 55 for m@xmath083 . 
 nevertheless , the linear resolution on each galaxy is about the same , with 1.5@xmath0kpc for m@xmath051  and 1.2@xmath0kpc for m@xmath083 . 
 the sfr surface density maps were created from images in the h@xmath60 line and in the 24@xmath35 continuum . according to @xcite , 
 the sfr , @xmath142 , within a source is given by @xmath143\qquad .\hfill \label{eqb1}\ ] ] @xmath144 is the integrated luminosity of the h@xmath60 line in @xmath145 ; @xmath92 is the frequency corresponding to the wavelength of 24@xmath35 ; @xmath146 is the luminosity of the 24@xmath35 continuum per unit frequency bandwidth in @xmath147 ; @xmath148 ; @xmath149 ; @xmath142 is in units of @xmath150 . 
 if @xmath19 is the sfr surface density , then @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the source solid angle and d is the source distance . using @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the source flux , and also using @xmath155 , with @xmath46 as the source surface brightness , results in @xmath156\qquad .\hfill \label{eqb2}\ ] ] for @xmath19 in units of @xmath157 , @xmath158 in units of @xmath159 , and @xmath160 in units of @xmath161 , we have @xmath162 and @xmath163 . 
 the numerical value of @xmath164 remains unchanged .    specifically for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 , 
 the sfr surface density maps were created by applying expression  ( [ eqb2 ] ) to the h@xmath60 ( i.e. , the line - integrated images of * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) and the spitzer 24@xmath35 images @xcite of both galaxies . 
 the images were convolved to the appropriate resolution and rebinned to 9@xmath42 pixels . 
 the @xmath158 image was converted to units of @xmath165 . 
 the final spatial resolution of the sfr surface density map for m@xmath051  is 38@xmath42 , which is that of the _ spitzer _ 160@xmath35 image . for m@xmath083 
 this is 55@xmath42 , which is that of the co  @xmath9 map . 
 the negative tails of the histograms of pixel values provided estimates of the noise levels . 
 the physical models of @xcite explore the possible dependence of the x - factor on the the star formation rate . in their section  5.1 
 , their results can be parameterized in the form @xmath166 where they find @xmath65 . with the results of the fits illustrated in figure  [ fig18 ] 
 , we can test this result as well as specify the parameter @xmath167 . 
 we repeat the derivation in section 5.1 of @xcite in more detail and adopt their nomenclature where applicable . 
 if co ( 1 - 0 ) is used to estimate the h@xmath41 surface density , @xmath168 , then we let @xmath169 represent this surface density as estimated by co. then @xmath170^{n_{obs } } =   k_{sco } \left[{x_{fm}}i(co)\right]^{n_{obs}}\ , \hfill \label{eqxs2}\ ] ] where @xmath171 is the power - law index that is observed when using co - derived molecular gas surface densities and @xmath126 is the mean x - factor value chosen for the galaxy observed . 
 is unimportant because it is the @xmath172 combination that matters . ] 
 using a tracer that supposedly gives the `` true '' @xmath168 , would have a similar relation : @xmath173^{n_{act } } =   k_{sco } \left[{x_f}i(co)\right]^{n_{act}}\qquad , \hfill \label{eqxs3}\ ] ] where @xmath174 is the actual correct power - law index and @xmath14 is the correct point - by - point value of the x - factor . combining expressions  ( [ eqxs2 ] ) and ( [ eqxs3 ] ) 
 so as to eliminate @xmath125 and comparing with ( [ eqxs1 ] ) yields @xmath175 and also , @xmath176    in the context of the current work , we assume that the dust tracers of the molecular gas give @xmath177 ( i.e. , ) . so the fits in the second panels of figure  [ fig18 ] yield the parameters @xmath178 and @xmath174 for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . 
 the fits in the fourth panels provide @xmath179 and @xmath171 . 
 the uncertainties of these quantities are likely dominated by systematics . 
 this means that @xmath167 has a roughly 50% uncertainty . 
 the effects of systematics on @xmath68 are difficult to estimate . 
 the formal uncertainties of @xmath68 using the current data are 3 - 4% .    with the above in mind , 
 expressions  ( [ eqxs4 ] ) and ( [ eqxs5 ] ) applied to the current data yield @xmath180 and @xmath66 for m@xmath051  and 0.79 and @xmath67 for m@xmath083 . 
 note that these values for @xmath167 give @xmath14 in @xmath55 units .","we observed the spiral galaxies m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  at 20@xmath1 spatial resolution with the bolometer array _

the outer disks of all galaxies also are there systematic differences of the x factor between arm and inter arm regions can previous methods of observationally inferring the dust mass absorption coefficient at millimetre wavelengths be refined how do the answers to those questions influence the specific form of the observed s k law in a given galaxy to address these questions and to better understand the gas and dust in spiral galaxies and their relationship to star formation we observed the grand design face on spiral galaxies m xmath051 and m xmath083with the bolometer array camera _ aztec _ aztronomical thermal emission camera mounted on the 15 m jcmt in hawaii at a wavelength of 1 1 xmath0 mm. not only are there different slopes in different galaxies but there are also different offsets particularly in post starburst galaxies see if no one such relation holds for all galaxies then the s k relation does not represent a universal physical law of star formation see perhaps the s k relation for a disk galaxy is a measure of how the inverse depletion time of the molecular gas varies radially in that disk galaxy e g inside out or outside in star formation which in turn is affected by the many properties of and processes in the disk of that particular galaxy see for example the spiral galaxies m xmath051 and m xmath083 were observed with the bolometer array _ aztec _ on the _ jcmt _ in the 1 1 xmath0 mm continuum at 20 xmath42 spatial resolution. both galaxies have been studied extensively at numerous wavelengths e g recent _ herschel _ observations of m xmath051 and

65,"general relativity and ordinary differential geometry should be replaced by non - commutative geometry at some point between the currently accessible energies of about 1 - 10 tev ( after starting the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern ) and the planck scale , which is @xmath2 times higher , where space - time and gravity should be quantized . 
 this could occur either at the planck scale or below . 
 quantum field theory on a non - commutative space - time ( ncqf ) could very well be an intermediate theory relevant for physics at energies between the lhc and the planck scale . 
 it certainly looks intermediate in structure between ordinary quantum field theory on commutative @xmath3 and string theory , the current leading candidate for a more fundamental theory including quantized gravity . 
 ncqft in fact appears as an effective model for certain limits of string theory @xcite .    in joint work with r. gurau , j. magnen and f. vignes - tourneret @xcite , using direct space methods , we provided recently a new proof that the grosse - wulkenhaar scalar @xmath4 theory on the moyal space @xmath5 is renormalisable to all orders in perturbation theory . 
 the grosse - wulkenhaar breakthrough @xcite was to realize that the right propagator in non - commutative field theory is not the ordinary commutative propagator , but has to be modified to obey langmann - szabo duality @xcite . 
 grosse and wulkenhaar were able to compute the corresponding propagator in the so called `` matrix base '' which transforms the moyal product into a matrix product . 
 this is a real _ tour de force _ ! 
 they use this representation to prove perturbative renormalisability of the theory up to some estimates which were finally proven in @xcite . 
 our direct space method builds upon the previous works of filk and chepelev - roiban @xcite . 
 these works however remained inconclusive @xcite , since these authors used the right interaction but not the right propagator , hence the problem of ultraviolet / infrared mixing prevented them from obtaining a finite renormalised perturbation series . 
 we also extend the grosse - wulkenhaar results to more general models with covariant derivatives in a fixed magnetic field @xcite . 
 our proof relies on a multiscale analysis analogous to @xcite but in direct space . 
 non - commutative field theories ( for a general review see @xcite ) deserve a thorough and systematic investigation , not only because they may be relevant for physics beyond the standard model , but also ( although this is often less emphasized ) because they can describe effective physics in our ordinary standard world but with non - local interactions .    in this case 
 there is an interesting reversal of the initial grosse - wulkenhaar problematic . in the @xmath4 theory on the moyal space @xmath5 , 
 the vertex is sort of god - given by the moyal structure , and it is ls invariant . 
 the challenge was to overcome uv / ir mixing and to find the right propagator which makes the theory renormalisable . 
 this propagator turned out to have ls duality . 
 the harmonic potential introduced by grosse and wulkenhaar can be interpreted as a piece of covariant derivatives in a constant magnetic field . 
 now to explain the ( fractional ) quantum hall effect , which is a bulk effect whose understanding requires electron interactions , we can almost invert this logic . 
 the propagator is known since it corresponds to non - relativistic electrons in two dimensions in a constant magnetic field . 
 it has ls duality . 
 but the interaction is unclear , and can not be local since at strong magnetic field the spins should align with the magnetic field , hence by pauli principle local interactions among electrons in the first landau level should vanish . 
 we can argue that among all possible non - local interactions , a few renormalisation group steps should select the only ones which form a renormalisable theory with the corresponding propagator . in the commutative case ( i.e. zero magnetic field ) local interactions such as those of the hubbard model are just renormalisable in any dimension because of the extended nature of the fermi - surface singularity . 
 since the non - commutative electron propagator ( i.e. in non zero magnetic field ) looks very similar to the grosse - wulkenhaar propagator ( it is in fact a generalization of the langmann - szabo - zarembo propagator ) we can conjecture that the renormalisable interaction corresponding to this propagator should be given by a moyal product . 
 that s why we hope that non - commutative field theory is the correct framework for a microscopic _ ab initio _ understanding of the fractional quantum hall effect which is currently lacking .    even for regular commutative field theory such as non - abelian gauge theory , 
 the strong coupling or non - perturbative regimes may be studied fruitfully through their non - commutative ( i.e. non local ) counterparts . 
 this point of view is forcefully suggested in @xcite , where a mapping is proposed between ordinary and non - commutative gauge fields which do not preserve the gauge groups but preserve the gauge equivalent classes . 
 we can at least remark that the effective physics of confinement should be governed by a non - local interaction , as is the case in effective strings or bags models . 
 in other words we propose to base physics upon the renormalisability principle , more than any other axiom . 
 renormalisability means genericity ; only renormalisable interactions survive a few rg steps , hence only them should be used to describe generic effective physics of any kind . 
 the search for renormalisabilty could be the powerful principle on which to orient ourselves in the jungle of all possible non - local interactions . 
 renormalisability has also attracted considerable interest in the recent years as a pure mathematical structure . 
 the work of kreimer and connes @xcite recasts the recursive bphz forest formula of perturbative renormalisation in a nice hopf algebra structure . 
 the renormalisation group ambiguity reminds mathematicians of the galois group ambiguity for roots of algebraic equations . 
 finding new renormalisable theories may therefore be important for the future of pure mathematics as well as for physics . 
 that was forcefully argued during the luminy workshop `` renormalisation and galois theory '' . 
 main open conjectures in pure mathematics such as the riemann hypothesis @xcite or the jacobian conjecture @xcite may benefit from the quantum field theory and renormalisation group approach .    considering that most of the connes - kreimer works uses dimensional regularization and the minimal dimensional renormalisation scheme , it is interesting to develop the parametric representation which generalize schwinger s parametric representation of feynman amplitudes to the non commutative context . 
 it involves hyperbolic generalizations of the ordinary topological polynomials , which mathematicians call kirchoff polynomials , and physicist call symanzik polynomials in the quantum field theory context @xcite . 
 we plan also to work out the corresponding regularization and minimal dimensional renormalisation scheme and to recast it in a hopf algebra structure . 
 the corresponding structures seem richer than in ordinary field theory since they involve ribbon graphs and invariants which contain information about the genus of the surface on which these graphs live .    a critical goal to enlarge the class of renormalisable non - commutative field theories and to attack the quantum hall effect problem is to extend the results of grosse - wulkenhaar to fermionic theories . 
 the simplest theory , the two - dimensional gross - neveu model can be shown renormalisable to all orders in their langmann - szabo covariant versions , using either the matrix basis @xcite or the direct space version developed here @xcite . 
 however the @xmath6-space version seems the most promising for a complete non - perturbative construction , using pauli s principle to controll the apparent ( fake ) divergences of perturbation theory .    in the case of @xmath7 , recall that although the commutative version is until now fatally flawed due to the famous landau ghost , there is hope that the non - commutative field theory treated at the perturbative level in this paper may also exist at the constructive level . indeed 
 a non trivial fixed point of the renormalization group develops at high energy , where the grosse - wulkenhaar parameter @xmath8 tends to 1 , so that langmann - szabo duality become exact , and the beta function vanishes . 
 this scenario has been checked explicitly to all orders of perturbation theory @xcite . 
 this was done using the matrix version of the theory ; again an @xmath6-space version of renormalisation might be better for a future rigorous non - perturbative investigation of this fixed point and a full constructive version of the model . 
 finally let us conclude this short introduction by reminding that a very important and difficult goal is to also extend the grosse - wulkenhaar breakthrough to gauge theories . 
 one considers free electrons : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the canonical conjugate of @xmath11 . 
 the moment and position @xmath12 and @xmath13 have commutators @xmath14=0,\ \ [ r_i , r_j]=0,\ \ [ p_i , r_j]=\imath\hbar\delta_{ij } .\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the moments @xmath15 have commutators @xmath16=-\imath\hbar\epsilon_{ij}eb,\ \ [ r_i , r_j]=0,\ \    [ \pi_i , r_j]=\imath\hbar\delta_{ij } .\end{aligned}\ ] ]    one can also introduce coordinates @xmath17 , @xmath18 corresponding to the centers of the classical trajectories @xmath19 which _ do not commute _ : @xmath20=\imath\hbar\epsilon_{ij}\frac{1}{e b}},\ \ [ \pi_i , r_j]=0 . 
 \end{aligned}\ ] ] this means that there exist heisenberg - like relations between quantum positions . 
 one considers the string action in a generalized background @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the string worldsheet , @xmath23 is a tangential derivative along the worldsheet boundary @xmath24 and @xmath25 is an antisymmetric background tensor . 
 the equations of motion determine the boundary conditions : @xmath26    boundary conditions for coordinates can be neumann ( @xmath27 ) or dirichlet ( @xmath28 , corresponding to branes ) . 
 after conformal mapping of the string worldsheet onto the upper half - plane , the string propagator in background field is @xmath29 \ ; .\end{aligned}\ ] ] for some constant symmetric and antisymmetric tensors @xmath30 and @xmath31 . 
 evaluated at boundary points on the worldsheet , this propagator is @xmath32 where the @xmath31 term simply comes from the discontinuity of the logarithm across its cut . interpreting @xmath33 as time , one finds @xmath34= i \theta^{\mu \nu } , \end{aligned}\ ] ] which means that string coordinates lie in a non - commutative moyal space with parameter @xmath31 . 
 there is an equivalent argument inspired by @xmath35 theory : a rotation sandwiched between two @xmath36 dualities generates the same constant commutator for string coordinates . 
 the recent progresses concerning the renormalisation of non - commutative field theory have been obtained on a very simple non - commutative space namely the moyal space . from the point of view of quantum field theory , it is certainly the most studied space . 
 let us start with its precise definition . 
 let us define @xmath37 and @xmath38 the free algebra generated by @xmath39 . 
 let @xmath40 a @xmath41 non - degenerate skew - symmetric matrix ( wich requires @xmath42 even ) and @xmath43 the ideal of @xmath38 generated by the elements @xmath44 . 
 the moyal algebra @xmath45 is the quotient @xmath46 . 
 each element in @xmath45 is a formal power series in the @xmath47 s for which the relation @xmath48 holds . 
 usually , one puts the matrix @xmath40 into its canonical form : @xmath49 sometimes one even set @xmath50 . the preceeding algebraic definition whereas short and precise may be too abstract to perform real computations . 
 one then needs a more analytical definition . 
 a representation of the algebra @xmath45 is given by some set of functions on @xmath51 equipped with a non - commutative product : the _ groenwald - moyal _ product . 
 what follows is based on @xcite . 
 [ [ sec : lalgebre - ca_theta ] ] the algebra @xmath45 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the moyal algebra @xmath45 is the linear space of smooth and rapidly decreasing functions @xmath52 equipped with the non - commutative product defined by : @xmath53 , @xmath54 this algebra may be considered as the `` functions on the moyal space @xmath55 '' . in the following we will write @xmath56 instead of @xmath57 and use : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 for 
 the fourier transform and @xmath61 for the twisted convolution . as on @xmath62 , 
 the fourier transform exchange product and convolution : @xmath63 one also shows that the moyal product and the twisted convolution are * associative * : @xmath64 using , we show the associativity of the @xmath65-produit . 
 the complex conjugation is * involutive * in @xmath45 @xmath66 one also have @xmath67    [ prop : trace ] for all @xmath68 , @xmath69    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the ordinary convolution .    in the following sections , we will need lemma [ lem : moyal - prods ] to compute the interaction terms for the @xmath72 and gross - neveu models . 
 we write @xmath73 . 
 [ lem : moyal - prods ] for all @xmath74 , let @xmath75 . then @xmath76    [ cor : int - moyal ] for all @xmath74 , let @xmath75 . 
 then @xmath77    the cyclicity of the product , inherited from proposition [ prop : trace ] implies : @xmath78 , @xmath79 and allows to extend the moyal algebra by duality into an algebra of tempered distributions . 
 [ [ sec : extens - par - dual ] ] extension by duality + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    let us first consider the product of a tempered distribution with a schwartz - class function . 
 let @xmath80 and @xmath81 . 
 we define @xmath82 and @xmath83 . 
 [ defn : tf ] let @xmath84 , @xmath85 , we define @xmath86 and @xmath87 by @xmath88    for example , the identity @xmath89 as an element of @xmath90 is the unity for the @xmath65-produit : @xmath91 , @xmath92 we are now ready to define the linear space @xmath93 as the intersection of two sub - spaces @xmath94 and @xmath95 of @xmath90 . 
 [ defn : m ] @xmath96    one can show that @xmath93 is an associative @xmath71-algebra . 
 it contains , among others , the identity , the polynomials , the @xmath97 distribution and its derivatives . 
 then the relation @xmath98 often given as a definition of the moyal space , holds in @xmath93 ( but not in @xmath45 ) .      the simplest non - commutative model one may consider is the @xmath99-theory on the four - dimensional moyal space . 
 its lagrangian is the usual ( commutative ) one where the pointwise product is replaced by the moyal one : @xmath100 = & \int d^4x \big ( -\frac{1}{2 } \partial_\mu \phi \star \partial^\mu \phi   + \frac{1}{2 } m^2 \,\phi \star \phi + \frac{\lambda}{4 } \phi \star \phi \star \phi \star \phi\big)(x).\label{eq : phi4naif}\end{aligned}\ ] ] thanks to the formula , this action can be explicitly computed . 
 the interaction part is given by the corollary [ cor : int - moyal ] : @xmath101 the main characteristic of the moyal product is its non - locality . 
 but its non - commutativity implies that the vertex of the model is only invariant under cyclic permutation of the fields . 
 this restricted invariance incites to represent the associated feynman graphs with ribbon graphs . 
 one can then make a clear distinction between planar and non - planar graphs . 
 this will be detailed in section [ sec : multi - scale - analysismatrix ] . 
 thanks to the delta function in , the oscillation may be written in different ways :    @xmath102    the interaction is real and positive . ] : @xmath103 it is also translation invariant as shows equation . 
 the property [ prop : trace ] implies that the propagator is the usual one : @xmath104 . 
 the non - locality of the @xmath65-product allows to understand the discovery of minwalla , van raamsdonk and seiberg @xcite . 
 they showed that not only the model is nt finite in the uv but also it exhibits a new type of divergences making it non - renormalisable . 
 in the article @xcite , filk computed the feynman rules corresponding to . 
 he showed that the planar amplitudes equal the commutative ones whereas the non - planar ones give rise to oscillations coupling the internal and external legs . 
 a typical example is the the non - planar tadpole : @xmath105 
 if @xmath106 , this amplitude is finite but , for small @xmath107 , it diverges like @xmath108 . in other words , if we put an ultraviolet cut - off @xmath109 to the @xmath110-integral , the two limits @xmath111 and @xmath112 do not commute . 
 this is the uv / ir mixing phenomena . 
 a chain of non - planar tadpoles , inserted in bigger graphs , makes divergent any function ( with six points or more for example ) . but 
 this divergence is not local and ca nt be absorbed in a mass redefinition . 
 this is what makes the model non - renormalisable . 
 we will see in sections [ sec : prop - et - renorm ] and [ sec : direct - space ] that the uv / ir mixing results in a coupling of the different scales of the theory 
 . we will also note that we should distinguish different types of mixing . 
 the uv / ir mixing was studied by several groups . 
 first , chepelev and roiban @xcite gave a power counting for different scalr models . 
 they were able to identify the divergent graphs and to classify the divergences of the theories thanks to the topological data of the graphs . 
 then v.  gayral @xcite showed that uv / ir mixing is present on all isospectral deformations ( they consist in curved generalisations of the moyal space and of the non - commutative torus ) . for this , he considered a scalar model and discovered contributions to the effective action which diverge when the external momenta vanish . 
 the uv / ir mixing is then a general characteristic of the non - commutative theories , at least on the deformations . 
 the situation remained so until h.  grosse and r.  wulkenhaar discovered a way to define a renormalisable non - commutative model . 
 we will detail their result in section [ sec : multi - scale - analysismatrix ] but the main message is the following . by adding an harmonic term to the lagrangian , @xmath113 = & \int d^4x \big ( -\frac{1}{2 } \partial_\mu \phi \star \partial^\mu \phi + \frac{\omega^2}{2 } ( \tilde{x}_\mu \phi ) \star ( \tilde{x}^\mu \phi ) + \frac{1}{2 } m^2 \,\phi \star \phi + \frac{\lambda}{4 } \phi \star \phi \star \phi \star \phi\big)(x)\label{eq : phi4omega}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath114 and the metric is euclidean , the model , in four dimensions , is renormalisable at all orders of perturbation @xcite . 
 we will see in section [ sec : direct - space ] that this additional term give rise to an infrared cut - off and allows to decouple the different scales of the theory . the new model ( [ eq : phi4omega ] ) , we call it @xmath72 , do not exhibit any mixing 
 . this result is very important because it opens the way towards other non - commutative field theories . in the following , 
 we will call _ _ vulcanisation__. ] the procedure consisting in adding a new term to a lagrangian of a non - commutative theory in order to make it renormalisable . + 
 the propagator @xmath115 of this @xmath116 theory is the kernel of the inverse operator @xmath117 . 
 it is known as the mehler kernel @xcite @xmath118 langmann and szabo remarked that the quartic interaction with moyal product is invariant under a duality transformation . 
 it is a symmetry between momentum and direct space . 
 the interaction part of the model is ( see equation ) @xmath119=&\int d^{4}x\,\frac{\lambda}{4}(\phi\star\phi\star\phi\star\phi)(x)\\    = & \int\prod_{a=1}^{4}d^{4}x_{a}\,\phi(x_{a})\,v(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4})\label{eq : vx}\\    = & \int\prod_{a=1}^{4}\frac{d^{4}p_{a}}{(2\pi)^{4}}\,\hat{\phi}(p_{a})\,\hat{v}(p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4})\label { eq : vp }    \intertext{with }    v(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4})=&\frac{\lambda}{4}\frac{1}{\pi^{4}\det\theta}\delta(x_{1}-x_{2}+x_{3}-x_{4 } ) \cos(2(\theta^{-1})_{\mu\nu}(x_{1}^{\mu}x_{2}^{\nu}+x_{3}^{\mu}x_{4}^{\nu}))\notag\\    \hat{v}(p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4})=&\frac{\lambda}{4}(2\pi)^{4}\delta(p_{1}-p_{2}+p_{3}-p_{4})\cos(\frac 12 \theta^{\mu\nu}(p_{1,\mu}p_{2,\nu}+p_{3,\mu}p_{4,\nu}))\notag\end{aligned}\ ] ] where we used a _ cyclic _ 
 fourier transform : @xmath120 . 
 the transformation @xmath121 exchanges and . 
 in addition , the free part of the model is nt covariant under this duality . 
 the vulcanisation adds a term to the lagrangian which restores the symmetry . 
 the theory is then covariant under the langmann - szabo duality : @xmath122\mapsto&\omega^{2}\,s[\phi;\frac{m}{\omega},\frac{\lambda}{\omega^{2 } } , \frac{1}{\omega } ] . 
 \end{aligned}\ ] ] by symmetry , the parameter @xmath8 is confined in @xmath123 . 
 let us note that for @xmath124 , the model is invariant .    [ 
 [ parag : interpharm ] ]    the interpretation of that harmonic term is not yet clear . 
 but the vulcanisation procedure already allowed to prove the renormalisability of several other models on moyal spaces such that @xmath125 @xcite , @xmath126 @xcite and the lsz models @xcite . 
 these last are of the type @xmath113 = & \int d^nx \big ( \frac{1}{2 } \bar{\phi}\star(-\partial_\mu+\xt_{\mu}+m)^{2}\phi + \frac{\lambda}{4 } \bar{\phi } \star \phi \star \bar{\phi } \star\phi\big)(x).\label{eq : lszintro}\end{aligned}\ ] ] by comparison with , one notes that here the additional term is formally equivalent to a fixed magnetic background . 
 deep is the temptation to interpret it as such . 
 this model is invariant under the above duality and is exactly soluble . 
 let us remark that the complex interaction in makes the langmann - szabo duality more natural . 
 it does nt need a cyclic fourier transform . 
 the @xmath127 have been studied at @xmath124 where they also exhibit a soluble structure .      apart from the @xmath72 , the modified bosonic lsz model @xcite and supersymmetric theories , we now know several renormalizable non - commutative field theories 
 . nevertheless they either are super - renormalizable ( @xmath128 @xcite ) or ( and ) studied at a special point in the parameter space where they are solvable ( @xmath129 @xcite , the lsz models @xcite ) . 
 although only logarithmically divergent for parity reasons , the non - commutative gross - neveu model is a just renormalizable quantum field theory as @xmath72 . 
 one of its main interesting features is that it can be interpreted as a non - local fermionic field theory in a constant magnetic background . 
 then apart from strengthening the `` vulcanization '' procedure to get renormalizable non - commutative field theories , the gross - neveu model may also be useful for the study of the quantum hall effect . 
 it is also a good first candidate for a constructive study @xcite of a non - commutative field theory as fermionic models are usually easier to construct . 
 moreover its commutative counterpart being asymptotically free and exhibiting dynamical mass generation @xcite , a study of the physics of this model would be interesting . 
 + the non - commutative gross - neveu model ( @xmath130 ) is a fermionic quartically interacting quantum field theory on the moyal plane @xmath131 . 
 the skew - symmetric matrix @xmath40 is @xmath132 the action is @xmath133=&\int    dx\lbt\psib\lbt-\imath\slashed{\partial}+\omega\xts+m+\mu\,\gamma_{5}\rbt\psi+v_{\text{o}}(\psib,\psi )    + v_{\text{no}}(\psib,\psi)\rbt(x)\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 is the interaction part given hereafter . 
 the @xmath137-term appears at two - loop order . 
 we use a euclidean metric and the feynman convention @xmath138 . 
 the @xmath139 and @xmath140 matrices form a two - dimensional representation of the clifford algebra @xmath141 . 
 let us remark that the @xmath142 s are then skew- hermitian : @xmath143 . 
 [ [ propagator ] ] propagator + + + + + + + + + +    the propagator corresponding to the action is given by the following lemma :    [ xpropa1gn ] the propagator of the gross - neveu model is @xmath144 with @xmath145 et @xmath146 . 
 + we also have @xmath147 . 
 if we want to study a @xmath148-_color _ model , we can consider a propagator diagonal in these color indices . 
 [ [ interactions ] ] interactions + + + + + + + + + + + +    concerning the interaction part @xmath149 , recall that ( see corollary [ cor : int - moyal ] ) for any @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 in @xmath45 , @xmath154 this product is non - local and only invraiant under cyclic permutations of the fields . 
 then , contrary to the commutative gross - neveu model , for which there exits only one spinorial interaction , the @xmath130 model has , at least , six different interacitons : the _ orientable _ ones    [ eq : int - orient ] @xmath155    where @xmath156 s and @xmath157 s alternate and the _ non - orientable _ ones    [ eq : int - nonorient ] @xmath158    all these interactions have the same @xmath6 kernel thanks to the equation . 
 the reason for which we call these interactions orientable or not will be clear in section [ sec : direct - space ] . 
 the matrix basis is a basis for schwartz - class functions . in this basis , 
 the moyal product becomes a simple matrix product . each field 
 is then represented by an infinite matrix @xcite .        in the matrix basis 
 , the action   takes the form : @xmath100=&(2\pi)^{d/2}\sqrt{\det\theta}\big(\frac 12\phi\delta\phi+\frac{\lambda}{4}\operatorname*{tr}\phi^{4}\big)\label { eq : sphi4matrix}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath159 and @xmath160 the ( four - dimensional ) matrix @xmath161 represents the quadratic part of the lagragian . 
 the first difficulty to study the matrix model is the computation of its propagator @xmath30 defined as the inverse of @xmath161 : @xmath162    fortunately , the action is invariant under @xmath163 thanks to the form of the @xmath40 matrix . 
 it implies a conservation law @xmath164 the result is @xcite @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath115 is a function in @xmath8 : @xmath167 . 
 the main advantage of the matrix basis is that it simplifies the interaction part : @xmath168 becomes @xmath169 . 
 but the propagator becomes very compllicated . 
 + let us remark that the matrix model is _ dynamical _ : its quadratic part is not trivial 
 . usually , matrix models are _ 
 local_.    a matrix model is called * local * if @xmath170 and * non - local * otherwise .    in the matrix theories , the feynman graphs are ribbon graphs . 
 the propagator @xmath171 is then represented by the figure [ fig : propamatrix ] .        in a local matrix model , the propagator preserves the index values along the trajectories ( simple lines ) . 
 the power counting of a matrix model depends on the topological data of its graphs . 
 the figure [ fig : ribbon - examples ] gives two examples of ribbon graphs . 
 each ribbon graph may be drawn on a two - dimensional manifold . 
 actually each graph defines the surface on which it is drawn . 
 let a graph @xmath30 with @xmath149 vertices , @xmath43 internal propagators ( double lines ) and @xmath172 faces ( made of simple lines ) . 
 the euler characteristic @xmath173 gives the genus @xmath174 of the manifold . 
 one can make this clear by passing to the * dual graph*. the dual of a given graph @xmath30 is obtained by exchanging faces and vertices . 
 the dual graphs of the @xmath175 theory are tesselations of the surfaces on which they are drawn . 
 moreover each direct face broken by exernal legs becomes , in the dual graph , a * puncture*. if among the @xmath172 faces of a graph , @xmath176 are broken , this graph may be drawn on a surface of genus @xmath177 with @xmath176 punctures . 
 the figure [ fig : topo - ruban ] gives the topological data of the graphs of the figure [ fig : ribbon - examples ] . 
 @xmath178        @xmath179v=3@xmath180i=3@xmath180f=2@xmath180b=2@xmath181 +        @xmath182        @xmath183v=2@xmath184i=3@xmath184f=1@xmath184b=1@xmath185      in @xcite , v.  r. , r.  wulkenhaar and f.  v .- t . used the multi - scale analysis to reprove the power counting of the non - commutative @xmath116 theory . 
 let @xmath30 a ribbon graph of the @xmath186 theory with @xmath148 external legs , @xmath149 vertices , @xmath43 internal lines and @xmath172 faces . 
 its genus is then @xmath187 . 
 four indices @xmath188 are associated to each internal line of the graph and two indices to each external line , that is to say @xmath189 indices . 
 but , at each vertex , the left index of a ribbon equals the right one of the neighbour ribbon . 
 this gives rise to @xmath190 independant identifications which allows to write each index in terms of a set @xmath191 made of @xmath190 indices , four per vertex , for example the left index of each half - ribbon . + 
 the graph amplitude is then @xmath192 where the four indices of the propagator @xmath30 of the line @xmath97 are function of @xmath193 and written + @xmath194 . 
 we decompose each propagator , given by : @xmath195 we have an associated decomposition for each amplitude @xmath196 where @xmath197 runs over the all possible assignements of a positive integer @xmath198 to each line @xmath97 . 
 we proved the following four propositions :    [ thm - th1 ] for @xmath35 large enough , there exists a constant @xmath199 such that , for @xmath200 $ ] , we have the uniform bound @xmath201    [ thm - th2 ] for @xmath35 large enough , there exists two constants @xmath199 and @xmath202 such that , for @xmath203 $ ] , we have the uniform bound @xmath204    this bound allows to prove that the only diverging graphs have either a constant index along the trajectories or a total jump of @xmath205 . 
 [ prop : bound3 ] for @xmath35 large enough , there exists a constant @xmath199 such that , for @xmath206 $ ] , we have the uniform bound @xmath207    this bound shows that the propagator is almost local in the following sense : with @xmath208 fixed , the sum over @xmath209 does nt cost anything ( see figure [ fig : propamatrix ] ) . nevertheless the sums we ll have to perform are entangled ( a given index may enter different propagators ) so that we need the following proposition . 
 [ prop : bound4 ] for @xmath35 large enough , there exists a constant @xmath199 such that , for @xmath206 $ ] , we have the uniform bound @xmath210    we refer to @xcite for the proofs of these four propositions . 
 about half of the @xmath190 indices initially associated to a graph is determined by the external indices and the delta functions in ( [ ig ] ) . 
 the other indices are summation indices . 
 the power counting consists in finding which sums cost @xmath211 and which cost @xmath212 thanks to ( [ thsum ] ) . 
 the @xmath211 factor comes from ( [ th1 ] ) after a summation over an index . ] 
 @xmath213 , @xmath214    we first use the delta functions as much as possible to reduce the set @xmath193 to a true minimal set @xmath215 of independant indices . for this , it is convenient to use the dual graphs where the resolution of the delta functions is equivalent to a usual momentum routing . 
 the dual graph is made of the same propagators than the direct graph except the position of their indices . 
 whereas in the original graph we have @xmath216 { oberfig-16.eps}}$ ] , the position of the indices in a dual propagator is @xmath217{oberfig-17.eps}}\;. \label{dual - assign}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the conservation @xmath218 in ( [ ig ] ) implies that the difference @xmath219 is conserved along the propagator . these differences 
 behave like an _ angular momentum _ and the conservation of the differences @xmath220 and @xmath221 is nothing else than the conservation of the angular momentum thanks to the symmetry @xmath222 of the action : @xmath223{oberfig-8.eps}}&\qquad l = m+\ell\;,~~ n = k+(-\ell ) . 
 \label{angmom}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the cyclicity of the vertices implies the vanishing of the sum of the angular momenta entering a vertex . 
 thus the angular momentum in the dual graph behaves exactly like the usual momentum in ordinary feynman graphs . 
 + we know that the number of independent momenta is exactly the number @xmath224 ( @xmath225 for a connected graph ) of loops in the dual graph . 
 each index at a ( dual ) vertex is then given by a unique _ reference index _ and a sum of momenta . 
 if the dual vertex under consideration is an external one , we choose an external index for the reference index . 
 the reference indices in the dual graph correspond to the loop indices in the direct graph . 
 the number of summation indices is then @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the number of broken faces of the direct graph or the number of external vertices in the dual graph . + by using a well - chosen order on the lines , an optimized tree and a @xmath228 bound 
 , one can prove that the summation over the angular momenta does not cost anything thanks to ( [ thsum ] ) . 
 recall that a connected component is a subgraph for which all internal lines have indices greater than all its external ones . 
 the power counting is then : @xmath229 and @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 are respectively the numbers of external legs , of vertices , of ( internal ) propagators , of faces and broken faces of the connected component @xmath235 ; @xmath236 is its genus . 
 we have    [ pc - slice ] the sum over the scales attributions @xmath137 converges if @xmath237 . 
 we recover the power counting obtained in @xcite .    from this point on , renormalisability of @xmath7 
 can proceed ( however remark that it remains limited to @xmath200 $ ] by the technical estimates such as ( [ th1 ] ) ; this limitation is overcome in the direct space method below ) . 
 the multiscale analysis allows to define the so - called effective expansion , in between the bare and the renormalized expansion , which is optimal , both for physical and for constructive purposes @xcite . in this effective expansion only the subcontributions with all _ internal _ scales higher than all _ external _ scales have to be renormalised by counterterms of the form of the initial lagrangian . 
 in fact only planar such subcontributions with a single external face must be renormalised by such counterterms . 
 this follows simply from the the grosse - wulkenhaar moves defined in @xcite . 
 these moves translate the external legs along the outer border of the planar graph , up to irrelevant corrections , until they all merge together into a term of the proper moyal form , which is then absorbed in the effective constants definition . 
 this requires only the estimates ( [ th1])-([thsummax ] ) , which were checked numerically in @xcite .    in this way 
 the relevant and marginal counterterms can be shown to be of the moyal type , namely renormalise the parameters @xmath238 , @xmath208 and @xmath8 term can be absorbed in a rescaling of the field , called `` field strength renromalization . '' ] . 
 notice that in the multiscale analysis there is no need for the relatively complicated use of polchinski s equation @xcite made in @xcite . 
 polchinski s method , although undoubtedly very elegant for proving perturbative renormalisability does not seem directly suited to constructive purposes , even in the case of simple fermionic models such as the commutative gross neveu model , see e.g. @xcite .    the bphz theorem itself for the renormalised expansion follows from finiteness of the effective expansion by developing the counterterms still hidden in the effective couplings . 
 its own finiteness can be checked e.g. through the standard classification of forests @xcite . 
 let us however recall once again that in our opinion the effective expansion , not the renormalised one is the more fundamental object , both to describe the physics and to attack deeper mathematical problems , such as those of constructive theory @xcite . 
 the matrix base simplfies very much at @xmath239 , where the matrix propagator becomes diagonal , i.e. conserves exactly indices . 
 this property has been used for the general proof that the beta function of the theory vanishes in the ultraviolet regime @xcite , leading to the exciting perspective of a full non - perturbative construction of the model . 
 we give here the results we get in @xcite . in this article , we computed the @xmath6-space and matrix basis kernels of operators which generalize the mehler kernel 
 . then we proceeded to a study of the scaling behaviours of these kernels in the matrix basis . 
 this work is useful to study the non - commutative gross - neveu model in the matrix basis . 
 the following lemma generalizes the mehler kernel @xcite :    [ hinxspace]let @xmath240 the operator : @xmath241 the @xmath6-space kernel of @xmath242 is : @xmath243 @xmath244    the mehler kernel corresponds to @xmath245 . 
 the limit @xmath246 gives the usual heat kernel . 
 let @xmath240 be given by with @xmath247 . 
 its inverse in the matrix basis is : @xmath248 where @xmath166 and @xmath115 is a function of @xmath8 : @xmath167 .      on the moyal space 
 , we modified the commutative gross - neveu model by adding a @xmath249 term ( see lemma [ xpropa1gn ] ) . 
 we have @xmath250 it will be useful to express @xmath30 in terms of commutators : @xmath251 where @xmath252 with @xmath145 and @xmath253 . 
 + we now give the expression of the fermionic kernel in the matrix basis . 
 the inverse of the quadratic form @xmath254 is given by in the preceeding section : @xmath255 the fermionic propagator @xmath30 ( [ xfullprop ] ) in the matrix basis may be deduced from the kernel . 
 we just set @xmath256 , add the missing term with @xmath257 and compute the action of @xmath258 on @xmath259 . 
 we must then evaluate @xmath260 in the matrix basis : @xmath261 this allows to prove :    let @xmath262 the kernel , in the matrix basis , of the operator + @xmath263 . 
 we have : @xmath264 where @xmath265 is given by ( [ eq : propinit - b ] ) and the commutators bu the formulas ( [ x0gamma ] ) and ( [ x1gamma ] ) .    the first two terms in the equation ( [ eq : matrixfullprop ] ) contain commutators and will be gathered under the name @xmath266 . 
 the last term will be called @xmath267 : @xmath268      we use the multi - scale analysis to study the behaviour of the propagator and revisit more finely the bounds to . in a slice @xmath269 , 
 the propagator is @xmath270 @xmath271 let @xmath272 and @xmath273 . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath274 and @xmath275 . 
 then the smallest index among @xmath276 is @xmath208 and the biggest is @xmath277 . 
 we have :    [ maintheorem ] under the assumptions @xmath278 and @xmath279 , there exists @xmath280 ( @xmath281 depends on @xmath8 ) such that the propagator of the non - commutative gross - neveu model in a slice @xmath269 obeys the bound @xmath282 the mass term is slightly different : @xmath283    we can redo the same analysis for the @xmath116 propagator and get @xmath284 which allows to recover the bounds to .      let us consider the propagator of the non - commutative gross - neveu model . 
 we saw in section [ sec : bornes ] that there exists two regions in the space of indices where the propagator behaves very differently . in one of them 
 it behaves as the @xmath116 propagator and leads then to the same power counting . in the critical region 
 , we have @xmath285 
 the point is that such a propagator does not allow to sum two reference indices with a unique line . 
 this fact was useful in the proof of the power counting of the @xmath116 model . 
 this leads to a _ 
 uv / ir mixing . 
 let us consider the graph in figure [ fig : sunsetj ] where the two external lines bear an index @xmath286 and the internal one an index @xmath287 . 
 the propagator obeys the bound in prop .   which means that it is almost local . 
 we only have to sum over one index per internal face .    on the graph of the figure [ fig : sunseti ] , if the two lines inside are true external ones , the graph has two broken faces and there is no index to sum over . 
 then by using prop . 
 we get @xmath288 . 
 the sum over @xmath269 converges and we have the same behaviour as the @xmath116 theory , that is to say the graphs with @xmath289 broken faces are finite . 
 but if these two lines belongs to a line of scale @xmath287 ( see figure [ fig : sunsetj ] ) , the result is different . 
 indeed , at scale @xmath269 , we recover the graph of figure [ fig : sunseti ] . to maintain the previous result ( @xmath290 ) , 
 we should sum the two indices corresponding to the internal faces with the propagator of scale @xmath291 . 
 this is not possible . 
 instead we have : @xmath292 the sum over @xmath269 diverges logarithmically . 
 the graph of figure [ fig : sunseti ] converges if it is linked to true exernal legs et diverges if it is a subgraph of a graph at a lower scale . 
 the power counting depends on the scales lower than the lowest scale of the graph . 
 it ca nt then be factorized into the connected components : this is uv / ir mixing . 
 + let s remark that the graph of figure [ fig : sunseti ] is not renormalisable by a counter - term in the lagrangian . 
 its logarithmic divergence ca nt be absorbed in a redefinition of a coupling constant . 
 fortunately the renormalisation of the two - point graph of figure [ fig : sunsetj ] makes the four - point subdivergence finite @xcite . 
 this makes the non - commutative gross - neveu model renormalisable . 
 we want now to explain how the power counting analysis can be performed in direct space , and the `` moyality '' of the necessary counterterms can be checked by a taylor expansion which is a generalization of the one used in direct commutative space . 
 in the commutative case there is translation invariance , hence each propagator depends on a single difference variable which is short in the ultraviolet regime ; in the non - commutative case the propagator depends both of the difference of end positions , which is again short in the uv regime , but also of the sum which is long in the uv regime , considering the explicit form ( [ eq : mehler ] ) of the mehler kernel . 
 let @xmath30 be an arbitrary connected graph . 
 the amplitude associated with this graph is in direct space ( with hopefully self - explaining notations ) : @xmath293 \prod_l c_l \ ; ,   \nonumber   \\ c_l= &    \frac{\omega^2}{[2\pi\sinh(\omega t_l)]^2}e^{-\frac{\omega}{2}\coth(\omega   t_l)(x_{v , i(l)}^{2}+x_{v',i'(l)}^{2 } ) + \frac{\omega}{\sinh(\omega t_l)}x_{v , i(l ) } . 
 x_{v',i'(l ) }    - \mu_0 ^ 2 t_l}\ ; .\nonumber \label{amplitude1}\end{aligned}\ ] ]      with these notations , defining @xmath298 , the propagators in our graph can be written as : @xmath299 ^ 2 } e^{-\frac{\omega}{4}\coth(\frac{\alpha_l}{2 } ) { u_l^2}- \frac{\omega}{4}\tanh(\frac{\alpha_l}{2 } ) { v_l^2 }   - \frac{\mu_0 ^ 2}{\omega } \alpha_l}\ ; .\label{tanhyp}\ ] ]      @xmath301\nonumber\\   c^i ( u , v ) = & \int_{m^{-2i}}^{m^{-2(i-1 ) } }   \frac{\omega d\alpha}{[2\pi\sinh(\alpha)]^2 } e^{-\frac{\omega}{4}\coth(\frac{\alpha}{2 } ) { u^2}- \frac{\omega}{4}\tanh(\frac{\alpha}{2 } ) { v^2 }   - \frac{\mu_0 ^ 2}{\omega } \alpha}\ ; , \end{aligned}\ ] ]              we pick a tree @xmath36 of lines of the graph , hence connecting all vertices , pick with a root vertex and build an _ orientation _ of all the lines of the graph in an inductive way . 
 starting from an arbitrary orientation of a field at the root of the tree , we climb in the tree and at each vertex of the tree we impose cyclic order to alternate entering and exiting tree lines and loop half - lines , as in figure [ otree ] 
 .    then we look at the loop lines . 
 if every loop lines consist in the contraction of an entering and an exiting line , the graph is called orientable 
 . otherwise we call it non - orientable as in figure [ nono ] 
 .      there are @xmath306 @xmath97 functions in an amplitude with @xmath306 vertices , hence @xmath306 linear equations for the @xmath307 positions , one for each vertex . 
 the _ position routing _ associated to the tree @xmath36 solves this system by passing to another equivalent system of @xmath306 linear equations , one for each branch of the tree . 
 this is a triangular change of variables , of jacobian 1 . 
 this equivalent system is obtained by summing the arguments of the @xmath97 functions of the vertices in each branch . 
 this change of variables is exactly the @xmath6-space analog of the resolution of momentum conservation called _ momentum routing _ in the standard physics literature of commutative field theory , except that one should now take care of the additional @xmath308 cyclic signs . 
 we have , calling @xmath310 the remaining integrand in ( [ amplitude2 ] ) : @xmath311 \ , \big]\ ; i_g(\{x_{v , i }   \ }   )    \\ = & \int \prod_{b } \delta \left (    \sum_{l\in t_b \cup l_b } u_{l } + \sum_{l\in l_{b,+}}v_{l}-\sum_{l\in l_{b,-}}v_{l } + \sum_{f\in x_b}\epsilon(f ) x_f \right ) i_g(\{x_{v , i }   \ } ) , \nonumber \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath312 is @xmath313 depending on whether the field @xmath314 enters or exits the branch . 
 we can now use the system of delta functions to eliminate variables . 
 it is of course better to eliminate long variables as their integration costs a factor @xmath315 whereas the integration of a short variable brings @xmath316 . 
 rough power counting , neglecting all oscillations of the vertices leads therefore , in the case of an orientable graph with @xmath148 external fields , @xmath306 internal vertices and @xmath317 internal lines at scale @xmath269 to :    * a factor @xmath318 coming from the @xmath211 factors for each line of scale @xmath269 in ( [ eq : propbound - phi4 ] ) , * a factor @xmath319 for the @xmath320 short variables integrations , * a factor @xmath321 for the long variables after eliminating @xmath309 of them using the delta functions .      in the non - orientable case 
 , we can eliminate one additional long variable since the rank of the system of delta functions is larger by one unit ! 
 therefore we get a power counting bound @xmath324 , which proves that only _ 
 orientable _ graphs may diverge . 
 in fact we of course know that not all _ orientable _ two and four point subgraphs diverge but only the planar ones with a single external face . 
 ( it is easy to check that all such planar graphs are indeed orientable ) . 
 since only these planar subgraphs with a single external face can be renormalised by moyal counterterms , we need to prove that orientable , non - planar graphs or orientable planar graphs with several external faces have in fact a better power counting than this crude estimate . 
 this can be done only by exploiting their vertices oscillations . 
 we explain now how to do this with minimal effort . 
 following filk @xcite , we can contract all lines of a spanning tree @xmath36 and reduce @xmath30 to a single vertex with `` tadpole loops '' called a `` rosette graph '' . 
 this rosette is a cycle ( which is the border of the former tree ) bearing loops lines on it ( see figure [ fig : rosette ] ) :        remark that the rosette can also be considered as a big vertex , with @xmath325 fields , on which @xmath148 are external fields with external variables @xmath6 and @xmath326 are loop fields for the corresponding @xmath327 loops . when the graph is orientable , the rosette is also orientable , which means that turning around the rosette the lines alternatively enter and exit . 
 these lines correspond to the contraction of the fields on the border of the tree @xmath36 before the filk contraction , also called the `` first filk move '' . 
 the rosette contribution after a complete first filk reduction is exactly : @xmath330 where the @xmath331 variables are the long or external variables of the rosette , counted with their signs , and the quadratic oscillations for these variables is @xmath332    we have now to analyze in detail this quadratic oscillation of the remaining long loop variables since it is essential to improve power counting . we can neglect the secondary oscillations @xmath333 and @xmath334 which imply short variables . 
 the second filk reduction @xcite further simplifies the rosette factor by erasing the loops of the rosette which do not cross any other loops or arch over external fields . 
 it can be shown that the loops which disappear in this operation correspond to those long variables who do not appear in the quadratic form @xmath335 . 
 the basic mechanism to improve the power counting of a single non - planar subgraph is the following : @xmath336 in these equations we used for simplicity @xmath290 instead of the correct but more complicated factor @xmath337 ( of course this does not change the argument ) and we performed a unitary linear change of variables @xmath338 , @xmath339 to compute the oscillating @xmath340 integral . the gain in ( [ gainoscill ] ) is @xmath341 , which is the difference between @xmath342 and the normal factor @xmath343 that the @xmath344 integral would have cost if we had done it with the regular @xmath345 factor for long variables . to maximize this gain 
 we can assume @xmath346 . 
 finally it remains to consider the case of subgraphs which are planar orientable but with more than one external face . 
 in that case there are no crossing loops in the rosette but there must be at least one loop line arching over a non trivial subset of external legs ( see e.g. line @xmath347 in figure [ fig : rosette ] ) . 
 we have then a non trivial integration over at least one external variable , called @xmath6 , of at least one long loop variable called @xmath348 . 
 this `` external '' @xmath6 variable without the oscillation improvement would be integrated with a test function of scale 1 ( if it is a true external line of scale @xmath349 ) or better ( if it is a higher long loop variable ) can not be the full combination of external variables in the `` root '' @xmath97 function . ] . 
 but we get now @xmath350 so that a factor @xmath315 in the former bound becomes @xmath351 hence is improved by @xmath316 .    in this way we can reduce the convergence of the multiscale analysis to the problem of renormalisation of planar two- and four - point subgraphs with a single external face , which we treat in the next section . 
 remark that the power counting obtained in this way is still not optimal . 
 to get the same level of precision than with the matrix base requires e.g. to display @xmath174 independent improvements of the type ( [ gainoscill ] ) for a graph of genus @xmath174 . 
 this is doable but basically requires a reduction of the quadratic form @xmath335 for single - faced rosette ( also called `` hyperrosette '' ) into @xmath174 standard symplectic blocks through the so - called `` third filk move '' introduced in @xcite . 
 we return to this question in section [ hyperbo ] . 
 the idea is that one should compare its amplitude to a similar amplitude with a `` moyal factor '' @xmath352 factorized in front , where @xmath353 . 
 but precisely because the graph is planar with a single external face we understand that the external positions @xmath6 only couple to _ short variables _ @xmath354 of the internal amplitudes through the global delta function and the oscillations . 
 hence we can break this coupling by a systematic taylor expansion to first order . 
 this separates a piece proportional to `` moyal factor '' , then absorbed into the effective coupling constant , and a remainder which has at least one additional small factor which gives him improved power counting . 
 this is done by expressing the amplitude for a graph with @xmath355 , @xmath356 and @xmath357 as : @xmath358 \ 
 e^{\imath uru+\imath usv } \\ & \hspace{-2 cm } \bigg\ { { \delta(\delta ) } + \int_{0}^{1}dt\bigg [ \mathfrak{u}\cdot \nabla \delta(\delta+t\mathfrak{u } ) + \delta(\delta+t\mathfrak{u } ) [ \imath xqu   + { \mathfrak r } ' ( t ) ]   \bigg ]   e^{\imath txqu + { \mathfrak r}(t ) }   \bigg\ } \ 
 .\nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath359 is the propagator taken at @xmath360 , @xmath361 and @xmath362 is a correcting term involving @xmath363 $ ] . 
 following the same strategy we have to taylor - expand the coupling between external variables and @xmath354 factors in two point planar graphs with a single external face to _ third order _ and some non - trivial symmetrization of the terms acording to the two external arguments to cancel some odd contributions . 
 the corresponding factorized relevant and marginal contributions can be then shown to give rise only to        again the bphz theorem itself for the renormalised expansion follows by developing the counterterms still hidden in the effective couplings and its finiteness follows from the standard classification of forests . 
 see however the remarks at the end of section [ sec : vari - indep ] . 
 since the bound ( [ eq : propbound - phi4 ] ) works for any @xmath366 , an additional bonus of the @xmath6-space method is that it proves renormalisability of the model for any @xmath8 in @xmath3670,1]$ ] in @xmath368 is irrelevant since it can be rewritten by ls duality as an equivalent model with @xmath8 in @xmath3670,1]$ ] . 
 ] , whether the matrix method proved it only for @xmath8 in @xmath3670.5,1]$ ] . 
 the interaction @xmath371 ensures that perturbation theory contains only orientable graphs . for @xmath372 
 the @xmath6-space propagator still decays as in the ordinary @xmath7 case and the model has been shown renormalisable by an easy extension of the methods of the previous section @xcite . 
 consider the @xmath6-kernel of the operator @xmath374 the gross - neveu model or the critical langmann - szabo - zarembo models correspond to the case @xmath375 . in these models 
 there is no longer any confining decay for the `` long variables '' but only an oscillation : @xmath376    this kind of models are called critical . 
 their construction is more difficult , since sufficiently many oscillations must be proven independent before power counting can be established . 
 the prototype paper which solved this problem is @xcite , which we briefly summarize now . 
 the main technical difficulty of the critical models is the absence of decreasing functions for the long @xmath331 variables in the propagator replaced by an oscillation , see ( [ eq : criticalpropa ] ) . 
 note that these decreasing functions are in principle created by integration over the @xmath377 variables . 
 ] : @xmath378 but to perform all these gaussian integrations for a general graph is a difficult task ( see @xcite ) and is in fact not necessary for a bphz theorem . 
 we can instead exploit the vertices and propagators oscillations to get rationnal decreasing functions in some linear combinations of the long @xmath331 variables . 
 the difficulty is then to prove that all these linear combinations are independant and hence allow to integrate over all the @xmath331 variables . to solve this problem 
 we need the exact expression of the total oscillation in terms of the short and long variables . 
 this consists in a generalization of the filk s work @xcite . 
 this has been done in @xcite . 
 once the oscillations are proven independant , one can just use the same arguments than in the @xmath116 case ( see section [ sec : routing - filk - moves ] ) to compute an upper bound for the power counting :    [ lem : compt - puissgn ] let @xmath30 a connected orientable graph . for all @xmath379 , 
 there exists @xmath380 such that its amputated amplitude @xmath381 integrated over test functions is bounded by @xmath382    as in the non - commutative @xmath116 case , only the planar graphs are divergent . 
 but the behaviour of the graphs with more than one broken face is different . 
 note that we already discussed such a feature in the matrix basis ( see section [ sec : prop - et - renorm ] ) . in the multiscale framework , 
 the feynamn diagrams are endowed with a scale attribution which gives each line a scale index . 
 the only subgraphs we meet in this setting have all their internal scales higher than their external ones . 
 then a subgraph @xmath383 of scale @xmath269 is called _ critical _ if it has @xmath384 and that the two `` external '' points in the second broken face are only linked by a single line of scale @xmath287 . 
 the typical example is the graph of figure [ fig : sunseti ] . in this case , the subgrah is logarithmically divergent whereas it is convergent in the @xmath116 model . 
 let us now show roughly how it happens in the case of figure [ fig : sunseti ] but now in @xmath6-space . 
 the same arguments than in the @xmath116 model prove that the integrations over the internal points of the graph [ fig : sunseti ] lead to a logarithmical divergence which means that @xmath385 in the multiscale framework . but remind that there is a remaining oscillation between a long variable of this graph and the external points in the second broken face of the form @xmath386 . but @xmath331 is of order @xmath387 which leads to a decreasing function implementing @xmath388 of order @xmath389 . 
 if these points are true external ones , they are integrated over test functions of norm @xmath349 . then thanks to the additional decreasing function for @xmath388 we gain a factor @xmath290 which makes the graph convergent . 
 but if @xmath6 and @xmath390 are linked by a single line of scale @xmath287 ( as in figure [ fig : sunsetj ] ) , instead of test functions we have a propagator between @xmath6 and @xmath390 . this one behaves like ( see ): @xmath391 the integration over @xmath388 instead of giving @xmath392 gives @xmath290 thanks to the oscillation @xmath393 . 
 then we have gained a good factor @xmath394 . 
 but the oscillation in the propagator @xmath395 now gives @xmath396 instead of @xmath397 and the integration over @xmath398 cancels the preceeding gain . 
 the critical component of figure [ fig : sunseti ] is logarithmically divergent . 
 this kind of argument can be repeated and refined for more general graphs to prove that this problem appears only when the extrernal points of the auxiliary broken faces are linked only by a _ single _ 
 lower line @xcite . 
 this phenomenon can be seen as a mixing between scales . 
 indeed the power counting of a given subgraph now depends on the graphs at lower scales . 
 this was not the case in the commutative realm . 
 fortunately this mixing does nt prevent renormalisation . 
 note that whereas the critical subgraphs are not renormalisable by a vertex - like counterterm , they are regularised by the renormalisation of the two - point function at scale @xmath291 . 
 the proof of this point relies heavily on the fact that there is only one line of lower scale . 
 let us conclude this section by mentionning the flows of the critical models . 
 one very interesting feature of the non - commutative @xmath116 model is the boundedness of its flows and even the vanishing of its beta function for a special value of its bare parameters @xcite . 
 note that its commutative counterpart ( the usual @xmath399 model on @xmath400 ) is asymptotically free in the infrared and has then an unbounded flow . 
 it turns out that the flow of the critical models are not regularized by the non - commutativity . 
 the one - loop computation of the beta functions of the non - commutative gross - neveu model @xcite shows that it is asymptotically free in the ultraviolet region as in the commutative case .        in ordinary commutative field theory , symanzik 
 s polynomials are obtained after integration over internal position variables . 
 the amplitude of an amputated graph @xmath30 with external momenta @xmath107 is , up to a normalization , in space - time dimension @xmath42 : @xmath401 the first and second symanzik polynomials @xmath402 and @xmath403 are      where the first sum is over spanning trees @xmath36 of @xmath30 and the second sum is over two trees @xmath405 , i.e. forests separating the graph in exactly two connected components @xmath406 and @xmath407 ; the corresponding euclidean invariant @xmath408 is , by momentum conservation , also equal to @xmath409 . 
 since the mehler kernel is still quadratic in position space it is possible to also integrate explicitly all positions to reduce feynman amplitudes of e.g. non - commutative @xmath7 purely to parametric formulas , but of course the analogs of symanzik polynomials are now hyperbolic polynomials which encode the richer information about ribbon graphs . 
 the reference for these polynomials is @xcite , which treats the ordinary @xmath7 case . in @xcite , 
 these polynomials are also computed in the more complicated case of critical models .    defining the antisymmetric matrix @xmath410 
 as @xmath411 the @xmath412functions appearing in the vertex contribution can be rewritten as an integral over some new variables @xmath413 . 
 we refer to these variables as to _ hypermomenta_. note that one associates such a hypermomenta @xmath413 to any vertex @xmath149 _ via _ the relation @xmath414    consider a particular ribbon graph @xmath30 . 
 specializing to dimension 4 and choosing a particular root vertex @xmath415 of the graph , one can write the feynman amplitude for @xmath30 in the condensed way @xmath416^{2 } d\alpha_{\ell } \int d x d p e^{-\frac { \omega}{2 } x g x^t}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath417 , @xmath418 summarizes all positions and hyermomenta and @xmath30 is a certain quadratic form . if we call @xmath419 and @xmath420 the external variables we can decompose @xmath30 according to an internal quadratic form @xmath335 , an external one @xmath35 and a coupling part @xmath421 so that @xmath422 performing the gaussian integration over all internal variables one obtains : @xmath423^{2 } d\alpha\frac{1}{\sqrt{\det q } } e^{-\frac{\ot}{2 } \begin{pmatrix } x_e & \bar{p } \\ \end{pmatrix } [ m - p q^{-1}p^{t } ] \begin{pmatrix } x_e \\ \bar{p } \\ \end{pmatrix}}\ .\end{aligned}\ ] ] this form allows to define the polynomials @xmath424 and @xmath425 , analogs of the symanzik polynomials @xmath354 and @xmath149 of the commutative case ( see ) . 
 they are defined by @xmath426 hu_{g , \bar{v } } ( t ) ^{-2 }     e^{-   \frac { hv_{g , \bar{v } } ( t , x_e , p_{\bar v})}{hu_{g , \bar{v } } ( t ) } } .\end{aligned}\ ] ] they are polynomials in the set of variables @xmath427 ( @xmath428 ) , the hyperbolic tangent of the half - angle of the parameters @xmath429 .        * 
 the polynomials @xmath424 and @xmath425 have a strong positivity property . roughly speaking they are sums of monomials with positive integer coefficients . 
 this positive integer property comes from the fact that each such coefficient is the square of a pfaffian with integer entries , * leading terms can be identified in a given `` hepp sector '' , at least for _ 
 orientable graphs_. a hepp sector is a complete ordering of the @xmath432 parameters . 
 these leading terms which can be shown strictly positive in @xmath424 correspond to super - trees which are the disjoint union of a tree in the direct graph and a tree in the dual graph . 
 hypertrees in a graph with @xmath306 vertices and @xmath172 faces have therefore @xmath433 lines . 
 ( any connected graph has hypertrees , and under reduction of the hypertree , the graph becomes a hyperrosette ) . 
 similarly one can identify `` super - two - trees '' @xmath425 which govern the leading behavior of @xmath425 in any hepp sector . 
 for the bubble graph of figure [ figex1 ] : @xmath435}^2+t_1t_2\big{[}2p_2 ^ 2+(1 + 16s^4)(x_1-x_4)^2                  \big{]}\,,\nonumber\\                  & + t_1

 [ figeye ] ) , we start by defining : @xmath440 the @xmath438 polynomial with fixed hypermomentum corresponding to the vertex with two external legs is : @xmath441 whereas with another fixed hypermomentum we get : @xmath442    note that the leading terms are identical and the choice of the root perturbs only the non - leading ones 
 . moreover note the presence of the @xmath443 term . 
 its presence can be understood by the fact that in the sector @xmath444 the subgraph formed by the lines @xmath445 has two broken faces . 
 this is the sign of a power counting improvement due to the additional broken face in that sector . to exploit it 
 , we have just to integrate over the variables of line @xmath446 in that sector , using the second polynomial @xmath447 for the triangle subgraph @xmath448 made of lines @xmath445 . 
 non - commutative qft seemed initially to have non - renormalisable divergencies , due to uv / ir mixing . 
 but following the grosse - wulkenhaar breakthrough , there has been recent rapid progress in our understanding of renormalisable qft on moyal spaces . 
 we can already propose a preliminary classification of these models into different categories , according to the behavior of their propagators :    * ordinary models at @xmath449 such as @xmath7 ( which has non - orientable graphs ) or @xmath450 models ( which has none ) . 
 their propagator , roughly @xmath451 is ls covariant and has good decay both in matrix space ( [ th1]-[thsummax ] ) and direct space ( [ tanhyp ] ) . 
 they have non - logarithmic mass divergencies and definitely require `` vulcanization '' i.e. the @xmath8 term . * 
 `` supermodels '' , namely ordinary models but at @xmath452 in which the propagator is ls invariant . 
 their propagator is even better . in the matrix base 
 it is diagonal , e.g. of the form @xmath453 , where @xmath454 is a constant . 
 the supermodels seem generically ultraviolet fixed points of the ordinary models , at which non - trivial ward identities force the vanishing of the beta function . 
 the flow of @xmath8 to the @xmath452 fixed point is very fast ( exponentially fast in rg steps ) . 
 * `` critical models '' such as orientable versions of lsz or gross - neveu ( and presumably orientable gauge theories of various kind : yang - mills , chern - simons ... ) . 
 they may have only logarithmic divergencies and apparently no perturbative uv / ir mixing . 
 however the vulcanized version still appears the most generic framework for their treatment . 
 the propagator is then roughly @xmath455 . in matrix space 
 this propagator shows definitely a weaker decay ( [ mainbound1 ] ) than for the ordinary models , because of the presence of a non - trivial saddle point . in direct space 
 the propagator no longer decays with respect to the long variables , but only oscillates . 
 nevertheless the main lesson is that in matrix space the weaker decay can still be used ; and in @xmath6 space the oscillations can never be completely killed by the vertices oscillations . 
 hence these models retain therefore essentially the power counting of the ordinary models , up to some nasty details concerning the four - point subgraphs with two external faces . 
 ultimately , thanks to a little conspiration in which the four - point subgraphs with two external faces are renormalised by the mass renormalisation , the critical models remain renormalisable . 
 this is the main message of @xcite . 
 * `` hypercritical models '' which are of the previous type but at @xmath452 . 
 their propagator in the matrix base is diagonal and depends only on one index @xmath208 ( e.g. always the left side of the ribbon ) . 
 it is of the form @xmath456 . in @xmath6 space 
 the propagator oscillates in a way that often exactly compensates the vertices oscillations . 
 these models have definitely worse power counting than in the ordinary case , with e.g. quadratically divergent four point - graphs ( if sharp cut - offs are used ) . 
 nevertheless ward identities can presumably still be used to show that they can still be renormalised . 
 this probably requires a much larger conspiration to generalize the ward identities of the supermodels . 
 parametric representation can be derived in the non - commutative case . 
 it implies hyper - analogs of symanzik polynomials which condense the information about the rich topological structure of a ribbon graph . 
 using this representation , dimensional regularization and dimensional renormalisation should extend to the non - commutative framework . 
 remark that trees , which are the building blocks of the symanzik polynomials , are also at the heart of ( commutative ) constructive theory , whose philosophy could be roughly summarized as `` you shall use trees , but you shall _ not _ develop their loops or else you shall diverge '' . 
 it is quite natural to conjecture that hypertrees , which are the natural non - commutative objects intrinsic to a ribbon graph , should play a key combinatoric role in the yet to develop non - commutative constructive field theory .    in conclusion 
 we have barely started to scratch the world of renormalisable qft on non - commutative spaces . 
 the little we see through the narrow window now open is extremely tantalizing . 
 there exists renormalizable ncqfts eg @xmath457 on @xmath458 , gross - neveu on @xmath459 and they seem to enjoy better propoerties than their commutative counterparts , for instance they no longer have landau ghosts ! 
 non - commutative non relativistic field theories with a chemical potential seem the right formalism for a study ab initio of condensed matter in presence of a magnetic field , and in particular of the quantum hall effect . 
 the correct scaling and rg theory of this effect presumably requires to build a very singular theory ( of the hypercritical type ) because of the huge degeneracy of the landau levels . to understand this theory and 
 the gauge theories on non - commutative spaces seem the most obvious challenges ahead of us .

66,"the interior of cells is both highly structured and dynamical . 
 active transport therefore plays a crucial role to target molecules to the various compartments of the cell as well as to maintain and reorganize the cell s structure . 
 these tasks are accomplished by the cytoskeleton , a network of protein fibers , and the cytoskeletal motors , proteins which use the filaments of the cytoskeleton as highways or rails for directed transport . 
 cytoskeletal motors are enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis of adenosinetriphosphate ( atp ) and , at the same time , use the free energy released from this reaction to perform mechanical work and convert it into directed movements . 
 these motor molecules have been studied extensively during the last decade , both experimentally and theoretically . 
 the main emphasis has been on the properties of single motor molecules , their motor mechanisms , and their directed walks along filaments @xcite .    the nanometer size and piconewton forces of the molecular motors 
 imply that the typical binding energies are of the order of the thermal energy @xmath0 and that the motor  filament binding can be overcome by thermal fluctuations . on large time and 
 length scales ( @xmath1s and @xmath2 m ) , motors perform peculiar random walks , where periods of directed active movements along filaments alternate with periods of non - directed brownian motion in the surrounding fluid after unbinding from a filament @xcite . 
 ( a related problem is the effective diffusion of an adsorbed particle along a surface via bulk excursions @xcite . ) 
 in order to study these random walks , we have recently introduced a class of lattice models , which are , on the one hand generic in the sense that they are independent of the specific motor mechanisms , but which we can , on the other hand , also apply to describe specific motor molecules by adapting the model parameters to the observed transport properties @xcite . in addition , we can easily incorporate motor  motor interactions such as the mutual exclusion from binding sites of the filaments , which leads to traffic jam-like density pattern and various kinds of phase transitions @xcite    in the following , we will review our results for the motor s random walks obtained from these lattice models and present some new results from the corresponding continuum equations . 
 the article is organized as follows : we introduce the lattice models in section [ sec : model ] . in section [ sec:2d3d ] , 
 we summarize our analytical results for the random walks on a lattice without confining walls . compartments with confining walls which are experimentally accessible are studied in section [ sec : finitegeoms ] , where we summarize our numerical results and present new analytical results from a continuum description of the random walks . 
 we have studied the random walks arising from many encounters with filaments by mapping them to random walks on a lattice @xcite . 
 a line of lattice sites represents a filament . 
 motors at these sites perform a biased random walk and move predominantly in one direction . per unit time , they make a forward step , a backward step and no step with probability @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , respectively , where @xmath6 is the spatial dimension . with a small probability @xmath7 
 , they move to each of the adjacent non - filament sites and thus unbind from the filament . at the non - filament sites the motors perform simple symmetric random walks and 
 move to each neighbor site with probability @xmath8 ( @xmath9 denotes the spatial dimension ) and rebind to the filament with probability @xmath10 when they reach again a filament site . 
 confining walls are implemented as repulsive boundaries , at which all movements into the walls are rejected . 
 consider a discrete time random walk on a two dimensional square lattice with lattice sites labeled by integer coordinates @xmath11 with the above transition probabilities . 
 the master equation for this dynamics reads  @xcite @xmath12 as initial condition we take an ensemble of particles at @xmath13 . 
 note that , for simplicity , we have chosen the sticking probability @xmath14 . 
 the fourier 
 laplace transforms of the probability distribution along the filament @xmath15 and of the full distribution @xmath16 are defined as @xmath17 the master equations is reduced to an algebraic equation @xmath18p_{{\rm b}}(r , s ) }     { s+1-\half\cos q-\half\cos r}. \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the average speed on the line . by integrating this result over @xmath20 we also obtain @xmath21 on the left hand side . 
 it thus satisfies a linear equation , that is easily solved . 
 we end up with the distribution @xmath22^{-1 }    \label{sold=2 } \end{aligned}\ ] ] for the motors bound to the filament , where @xmath23 . 
 the distribution for the unbound motors follows from eq . 
 ( [ p2= ] ) .      _ survival fraction . 
 _ we extract the transport properties of the motor s random walk from ( [ sold=2 ] ) . 
 the value at @xmath24 gives the laplace transform @xmath25 of the probability @xmath26 that the motor is bound to the filament : @xmath27^{-1}\ ] ] for small times this implies @xmath28 which is a power series in @xmath29 . for @xmath30 , this is somewhat surprising : although the motors detach at times @xmath31 , the recurrent behavior of the random walk brings them mostly back to the filament , with half - integer powers in @xmath32 due to diffusion . for times 
 @xmath33 we find @xmath34/ { \sqrt{\pi\,\epsilon^2\,t}}$ ] . 
 the @xmath35 decay expresses that finally all motors unbind , and agrees with scaling arguments  @xcite . 
 _ average position and speed on the filament line . _ 
 the expression ( [ sold=2 ] ) for @xmath21 contains much more information . at linear order in @xmath36 
 we may derive the average position of motor particles along the filament line , @xmath37 . 
 we obtain for short times @xmath38 $ ] . 
 the average position of the motors bound to the filament is given by @xmath39 and their average speed is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the average speed if the particles did not leave the line . for large times 
 one gets @xmath42/{\epsilon } $ ] and @xmath43 , confirming the scaling @xmath44 @xcite . 
 the effective motor velocity is reduced by a factor @xmath45 , i.e. , by the probability that a motor is in the bound state . 
 the relation @xmath46 also applies to a simple two - state random walk , where motion is directed in one of the states only . 
 in contrast to the simple two - state random walk , however , the probability @xmath47 is time - dependent . 
 _ dispersion and diffusion coefficient on the filament line . 
 _ from the second moment @xmath48 we may define the normalized second moment @xmath49 , the dispersion @xmath50 and the diffusion coefficient , @xmath51 . 
 the results for the latter read at short @xmath32 @xmath52 and for large @xmath32 @xmath53 the limiting value of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath54 is large compared to the diffusion coefficient of the one - dimensional random walk along the filament , @xmath55 . 
 this broadening of the distribution occurs since the unbound motors lag behind the bound ones , which implies that also the rebinding motors lag behind those that have been bound for some time .    _ 
 the density profile on the filament _ can be evaluated analytically for large @xmath56 and @xmath32 , @xmath57 the exponential decay for @xmath58 expresses the large probability of unbinding for @xmath59 . 
 comparison with the results of monte carlo simulations shows very good agreement for times larger than about 8000 time steps @xcite .      eventually every motor will unbind and diffuse in the surrounding fluid 
 we now discuss the effects of the filament on the behavior of the unbound motors . 
 _ position and longitudinal diffusion . 
 _ one finds for the average velocity of unbound motors at small times @xmath60 and at large times @xmath61 $ ] . 
 whereas each individual motor has zero average velocity in the fluid , the statistical velocity @xmath62 is non - zero , since it is driven by unbinding from the cloud of motors moving on the filament . 
 the longitudinal diffusion coefficient behaves at large times as @xmath63+{1}/{4}$ ] . 
 the order of magnitude @xmath64 tells us that , like on the line , longitudinal diffusion is strongly enhanced by the unbinding from and binding back to the line . 
 the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is modified much less , @xmath65 at short times , while at large times @xmath66 . 
 so the transverse diffusion starts out very small , and finally reaches its free space value .    _ 
 the spatio - temporal density profile of the unbound motors _ can also be derived , @xmath67    the presence of multiple tracks on microtubules can be modeled by internal states , which keeps the problem solvable  @xcite . 
 the same setup can be studied in @xmath68  @xcite . 
 the fourier - laplace transformed density on the filament now reads @xmath69       \,i(r , s)}.\ ] ] with @xmath70 and @xmath71 and involving the complete elliptic integral @xmath72^{-1}$ ] . 
 the main difference is now that the density of motors on the filament decays faster , as @xmath73 , because of a reduced return probability . 
 lack of space prevents us to discuss this any further , but we will present some results from continuum equations for the three - dimensional case below . 
 we have also studied these random walks in compartments with simple geometries which are accessible to _ in vitro _ 
 experiments @xcite . in these geometries , 
 a filament is immobilized to a surface , and the diffusion of unbound motors is restricted by confining walls . in the simplest case , the unbound motors can diffuse freely in the half space above the surface to which the filament is immobilized . by placing the filament in a quasi two - dimensional slab or in a rectangular or cylindrical tube 
 , diffusion can be restricted along one or two dimensions perpendicular to the filament . 
 we denote the linear extensions of the compartments by @xmath74 . scaling arguments and simulations 
 show that , at large times with @xmath75 , when the motors experience the presence of the confining walls , these systems exhibit the same scaling behavior as systems with the same dimensionality , but without confining walls . for compartments with unconfined diffusion in @xmath76 dimensions perpendicular to the filament , 
 the effective velocity is given by @xmath77 with @xmath78 . 
 the continuum equations for the random walks of the motors can be solved in a similar way to the master equations of the lattice models . since 
 boundary conditions are easily implemented in the continuum model , we use them to derive analytical solutions for the half space , slab and tube geometry , see also ref . 
 we denote the coordinate parallel to the filament by @xmath79 and the coordinates perpendicular to it by @xmath80 . 
 the continuum equations are given by @xmath81   \label{diff_gl1_3d}\\    \frac{\partial p}{\partial t } & = & -v_{{\rm b}}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x } + d_{{\rm b}}\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}-\tilde\epsilon p + { \tilde\pi_{\rm ad}}p_0,\label{diff_gl2_3d}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with the bound - state velocity and diffusion coefficient @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the unbound diffusion coefficient @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . 
 _ full three - dimensional space . 
 _ let us start with the full three - dimensional space . 
 we use the fourier  laplace transformed form of eqs . 
 ( [ diff_gl1_3d ] ) and ( [ diff_gl2_3d ] ) , @xmath88 with the momentum @xmath89 and with the same initial conditions as before . 
 this leads to @xmath90 to obtain a convergent integral , we introduce a cutoff @xmath91 as the upper integration limit . 
 this cutoff corresponds to a certain range of attraction or thickness of the filament or a size of the motor and assures that the motor indeed returns to the filament . 
 defining @xmath92 we obtain @xmath93 and @xmath94 where the second expression is valid for small @xmath95 and @xmath36 . 
 as before , the binding probability is obtained for @xmath24 . for sufficiently small @xmath95 , 
 the cutoff term can be neglected , and inverting the laplace transform leads to @xmath96 in agreement with the result from the lattice model .    _ half space . _ 
 the case of the half space can be treated by the method of reflection and superposition , see e.g.  ref . 
 the part of the three - dimensional solution for @xmath97 can be reflected at the surface , so that the superposition @xmath98 is obtained , which fulfills the boundary condition @xmath99 at @xmath100 . 
 the density profile is symmetric under reflection at the plane @xmath100 , so we obtain just twice the solution for the full three - dimensional space and thus , also the double for the velocity and the displacement .    _ slab . 
 _ let us now consider a slab of height @xmath101 , where the filament is located at @xmath102 in the middle of the slab . 
 the case where the filament is immobilized at the lower surface of the slab follows then by reflection and superposition . 
 the boundary conditions are @xmath103 at @xmath104 or , equivalently , periodic boundary conditions at @xmath104 . 
 we can therefore expand the unbound density into a fourier series , @xmath105 with @xmath106 . here and in the following we use the symbol @xmath107 for discrete and @xmath20 for continuous momentum variables . 
 for the other variables , we take the fourier and laplace transforms in the same way as above . 
 ( [ p0_as_integral_d=3 ] ) becomes now @xmath108 we integrate out @xmath109 as before . 
 in addition , we approximate the summation over @xmath110 by the term for @xmath111 and twice the integral @xmath112 where we introduced again a cutoff @xmath113 . we obtain @xmath114^{-1}\ ] ] for small @xmath36 . for motors which have not yet reached the boundaries of the slab , i.e.  for @xmath115 
 , we recover the result for the full three - dimensional space . for larger times or @xmath116 , 
 the square root term is dominating in eq . 
 ( [ slab_lsg ] ) and we obtain the two - dimensional result @xcite with an effective reattachment rate @xmath117 . in summary , at large times the probability to be bound to the filament and , thus , the effective velocity @xmath77 behave as @xmath118 with the crossover time @xmath119 .    _

67,"this paper is based on a talk given at a conference in naples @xcite . 
 it is well known that if backward time travel could be implemented , or if the present could shape the past by some other means , then closed causal chains , or causal loops , could be formed . 
 the possibility of causal loops must arise because changing , or rewriting , the past is not particularly meaningful . 
 if these loops are not self consistent , paradoxes arise @xcite . 
 the best known of these is the grandfather paradox : a man travels into the past to kill his grandfather before his grandfather meets his grandmother . 
 if he succeeds then we have the paradox that the man is never born , thus the grandfather is not killed , thus the man is born and so on . 
 a simpler and more direct example is autoinfanticide , whereby a man travels into the past and shoots himself as a baby . 
 a different example is where a man travels back and introduces his parents to each other @xcite . 
 here we have a paradox if he fails in his task . 
 a more direct version of this latter type of paradox involves a robot , let us say , which enters a time machine in the present . 
 when it emerges from the machine in the past it is sent through a rejuvenator which removes its memory and programs it to walk around until it enters the time machine in the present . 
 a paradox occurs if something prevents the robot from entering the time machine in the present . 
 sometimes the possibility of such paradoxes is taken as an argument against the possibility of backward time travel . 
 it can , however , be argued that , because of continuity in nature , self - consistent loops or cycles in these situations always exist and it is only these cycles that nature allows @xcite . 
 somehow the physics sorts things out so that the probability of inconsistent cycles is zero 
 . we shall refer to this argument as the principle of self consistency @xcite . 
 an example of a self - consistent solution to the autoinfanticide cycle is the scenario in which the man raises his rifle to shoot himself as a baby but , because of his bad shoulder , misses the baby s heart and hits it in the shoulder @xcite . 
 if we accept that self - consistent loops are reasonable , the question arises as to the mechanism by which physics disallows inconsistent loops and ensures self consistency . in this paper 
 we show that quantum mechanics may provide an answer to this question . 
 quantum mechanics is essentially concerned with the preparation of a system and its subsequent measurement . 
 the measurement device can be described mathematically by a probability operator measure ( pom ) @xcite . 
 each element @xmath0 of the pom corresponds to a possible outcome event _ j _ of the measurement . 
 all the pom elements are non - negative definite , that is , their expectation values for any state of the system are greater than or equal to zero . 
 the pom elements sum to the unit operator , ensuring that the probability that there is some outcome of the measurement is unity . 
 the pom elements themselves indicate the states the system can be `` found in '' . the preparation device can be described mathematically by a collection of preparation device operators ( pdo ) @xmath1 associated with possible preparation outcomes @xcite . 
 these non - negative definite operators indicate the possible states the system can be `` prepared in '' . 
 the _ a priori _ 
 probability @xmath2 for a preparation event _ i _ is given by the trace tr@xmath1 . 
 the trace of the sum of all the @xmath1 is unity , ensuring that the probability that there is some outcome of the preparation is unity . 
 an essential feature of quantum mechanics , as opposed to classical mechanics , is that , even if there is no evolution of the system between the preparation and measurement events , the state the system is found in is not necessarily the state the system is prepared in . 
 the usual formalism of quantum mechanics is predictive . between preparation and measurement 
 we assign to the system a state on the basis of our knowledge of the preparation event . if we have no knowledge of the outcome of the preparation , the best we can do is to assign a density operator immediately after preparation equal to the sum of the pdo s . 
 if , however , we know the outcome was the preparation event _ i _ , we assign the normalized density operator @xmath3 @xmath4tr@xmath1 immediately after preparation . 
 this state evolves unitarily forward in time to become @xmath5 at the time of measurement . 
 @xmath6 is the usual forward time unitary evolution operator . upon measurement 
 there is a discontinuous change , or collapse , of the state to that corresponding to the pom element associated with the particular measurement outcome _ j_. the probability for the measurement outcome _ j , 
 _ given the preparation outcome _ 
 i , _ is given by @xmath7 . 
 \label{e1}\ ] ]    as the name indicates , the predictive formalism is particularly useful for predicting outcomes of measurement events based on knowledge of preparation events . 
 we can use the formalism , in conjunction with bayes theorem , to retrodict outcomes of preparation events given measurement events@xcite . from bayes theorem we have @xmath8    when the known outcome _ 
 i _ of the preparation device corresponds to a pure state @xmath9 , both @xmath1 and @xmath4tr@xmath1 are just @xmath10 . 
 also when the known outcome _ j _ of the measurement device corresponds to a pure state @xmath11 both @xmath0 and @xmath12tr@xmath0 are just @xmath13 . 
 it is simpler in such cases to work with the associated pure states instead of the pdo s and pom elements . 
 expression ( [ e1 ] ) then becomes simply @xmath14 . 
 an interesting situation arises when we have prepared two systems _ a _ and _ b _ in an entangled pure state , which evolves to , say , @xmath15 at the time of the measurement of system _ b _ , which is measured before system _ a_. if the measurement outcome is the pom element corresponding to state @xmath16 , then , in the predictive formalism , the measurement projects this state onto the entangled state , giving the state @xmath17 after normalization . 
 this collapsed state continues to evolve forwards in time until system _ a _ is measured .      a less usual , but equally valid , quantum mechanical formalism is the retrodictive formalism @xcite . here 
 the state of a system between preparation and measurement is assigned on the basis of our knowledge of the _ measurement _ event . 
 if we know the outcome was the measurement event _ j _ , we assign the normalized density operator @xmath18tr@xmath0 to the system immediately before measurement @xcite . 
 this state evolves unitarily _ backwards _ in time to become @xmath19 at the time of preparation . upon preparation 
 there is a discontinuous change , or collapse , of the state to that corresponding to the pdo associated with the particular preparation outcome _ 
 i_. the probability for the preparation outcome _ 
 i _ given the measurement outcome _ 
 j _ is given by @xmath20}.   \label{e4}\ ] ] the denominator ensures the probabilities for all possible preparation events sum to unity . 
 it is not difficult to show , using the cyclic property of the trace , that this is the same as the formula for @xmath21 in ( [ e2 ] ) obtained from the predictive formalism plus bayes theorem . 
 use of the retrodictive formalism for this purpose is more direct , however , which is why it is becoming useful for solving the basic quantum communication problem @xcite , in which bob measures the state of a quantum system sent by alice and has to retrodict the state she selected to send . 
 our interest now , however , is the application of the retrodictive formalism to entangled systems . 
 suppose the result of a measurement on two systems _ a _ and _ b _ corresponds to the pom element associated with the pure _ retrodictive _ entangled state which evolves backwards in time to    @xmath15 at the time of the preparation of system _ b _ , which is prepared after system _ a _ is prepared . 
 if the preparation outcome is the pdo corresponding to state @xmath22 , then we project this state onto the entangled state , renormalize , and obtain the state @xmath23 this collapsed retrodictive state continues to evolve backwards in time until the time of the preparation of system _ 
 an even more interesting case arises when a retrodictive state from a measurement of system _ c _ at time @xmath24 evolves backwards to a state @xmath25 at the time @xmath26 of a preparation outcome that corresponds to the entangled state    @xmath27 the projection of @xmath28 onto this state collapses it to @xmath29 , which can be associated with a predictive state evolving forwards in time from @xmath26 . 
 a method of making predictive entangled states is to prepare the light in the input modes _ b _ and _ c _ of a beam splitter in the vacuum and one - photon states with preparation devices p0 and p1 respectively . 
 we can then write the predictive input state as @xmath30 . to be specific , 
 let the beam splitter , as shown in fig . 
 1(a ) , be symmetric and reflect as much light as it transmits . 
 the action of the beam splitter can be represented by a unitary operator @xmath31 . 
 it is possible to show that for this 50/50 beam splitter , the action of the beam splitter on the input state is to transform it to the entangled state @xcite @xmath32 in the output of the beam splitter . 
 this shows that there is an equal chance for the photon to remain in mode _ c _ , that is to be transmitted , and for it to be reflected into mode _ 
 b_. it is sometimes convenient to regard p0 , p1 and the beam splitter as a combined preparation device that generates the predictive state @xmath33 if the outcomes of p0 and p1 correspond to zero and one photons . 
 this entangled state then propagates forward in time . 
 if , at a later time @xmath24 , a measurement on the field in mode _ c _ shows that the photon is in mode _ c _ then , according to the usual description of the measurement process in the predictive formalism , the field instantaneously collapses at @xmath24 to @xmath34 after normalization . 
 that is , the field in mode _ b _ changes suddenly to the vacuum simultaneously with the measurement of the field in mode _ 
 c , _ even though this measurement event can take place an appreciable distance away . 
 this , of course , is just an illustration of the well - known einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox involving instantaneous collapse over a large distance . 
 the vacuum state @xmath35 , being a predictive state , continues to propagate forwards in time .     and @xmath36 . 
 in ( b ) photodetectors d1 and d0 detect one and zero photons in output modes @xmath37 and @xmath38.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    an entangled _ retrodictive _ state can be made as follows . 
 photon detectors d1 and d0 are in the output ports _ b _ and _ a _ of a 50/50 beam splitter as shown in fig . 
 if d1 detects one photon and d0 detects zero photons , the output field of the beam splitter is in the retrodictive state @xmath39 . 
 this state propagates backwards in time through the beam splitter . 
 the unitary operator for this evolution is @xmath40 . 
 we can show that @xmath41 which can be interpreted that the photon has an equal chance of being reflected in its journey back in time into mode _ a _ or of staying in mode _ 
 b_. it is sometimes convenient to regard d1 , d0 and the beam splitter as a combined measurement device that generates the retrodictive state @xmath42 corresponding to the combined event of d1 detecting one photon and d0 detecting zero photons . 
 if there is a preparation device with a known output state acting on input mode _ a _ , then we can project this state onto the retrodictive entangled state , resulting in a retrodictive state in input mode _ 
 b_. this retrodictive state continues to evolve backwards in time . 
 let us examine , in terms of the retrodictive formalism , the case where a combined preparation device generates the predictive state @xmath43 at time @xmath44 for example as described above , and where a later measurement on the field in mode _ c _ at time @xmath24 _  _ shows the presence of one photon in this mode . 
 we attach a retrodictive state @xmath45 to the field at the time of measurement . 
 this state evolves backwards in time and becomes @xmath46 at the output of the combined preparation device , that is at the output port of the beam splitter , at time @xmath26 . here 
 @xmath47 is the hermitian conjugate of the free - space forward time evolution operator from @xmath26 to @xmath48 the effect of @xmath49on @xmath50 is to leave this state unchanged , so at the preparation time @xmath51we project @xmath50 onto the state @xmath52 , leaving us after normalization with the predictive state @xmath35 which evolves forward in time . 
 this is the same state that we obtained in the predictive description of the same situation but there is an important difference . in the retrodictive formalism 
 the collapse to this state takes place at @xmath53 the time of preparation , that is _ as the field is leaving the beam splitter _ , whereas in the predictive formalism it occurs at @xmath54 the time of measurement , giving rise to the einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox . 
 we can combine the above beam splitter with preparation devices p0 and p1 in its input modes , which we shall refer to as bsl , and the above beam splitter with photon detectors d0 and d1 in its output modes , which we shall refer to as bsu , to form a double beam splitter arrangement that shares the common mode _ 
 b _ , as shown in fig 
 . 2 @xcite . 
 bsl and bsu are the lower and upper beam splitters in this figure . 
 the output mode _ b _ of beam splitter bsl becomes the input mode _ 
 b _ of bsu . in the other input mode of bsu , 
 that is input mode _ a _ , we put a preparation device whose single possible outcome event corresponds to the known predictive state @xmath55 at the immediate entry to bsu . 
 we assume also that we can adjust the preparation device to control the ratio of the coefficients @xmath56 . 
 we also know that p0 and p1 prepare vacuum and one - photon states respectively . 
 we can interpret the superposition state ( [ e7 ] ) as showing that one or zero photons might be in input mode _ 
 including the photon input from p1 , detectors d0 and d1 might detect a total of either one or two photons . 
 there is a sizeable probability that d0 and d1 will detect zero and one photons respectively . 
 we can calculate this probability , which depends on @xmath57 but we do not need the precise result here . 
 other possible measurement outcomes are d0 and d1 detecting one and zero photons respectively , one and one photon respectively , zero and two photons respectively and two and zero photons respectively . 
 is the same as the state @xmath58 .,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    let us study the case in which detectors d0 and d1 detect zero and one photons respectively . as seen in ( [ e6 ] ) , this detection event generates an entangled retrodictive state @xmath59 at the input to bsu . 
 as we know there is a preparation event corresponding to a predictive state @xmath60 here , we project this state onto the entangled state and obtain the retrodictive state that , after normalization , is @xmath61 this is the state of the field at the time @xmath24 . 
 this state propagates backwards in time in mode _ b _ to become @xmath62 at the output mode _ b _ port of the other beam splitter bsl at the earlier time @xmath26 . 
 the action of the free space backward time evolution operator @xmath49 is just to change the phase of the state @xmath63 . to avoid unnecessary complications without losing the essential physics , 
 we now specify that the optical distance between the two beam splitters is an integer number of wavelengths of the light . 
 this means that the retrodictive state at the earlier time @xmath26 at the output of bsl becomes again @xmath63 . at this time 
 this state is projected onto the known output @xmath43 of the combined p0 , p1 and bsl preparation device to give @xmath64 after normalization and removal of the undetectable phase factor _ 
 i _ , we see that this predictive state in mode _ c _ , which we label @xmath65 , is identical to the predictive state @xmath66 in ( [ e7 ] ) which we inject into bsu _ at a later time . 
 _    we see therefore that , by means of the double beam splitter device , we can send a state of light @xmath67 , for which we can choose the ratio @xmath56 , backwards in time from when we prepare it at time @xmath24 to an earlier time @xmath68 . in principle 
 the beam splitters can be separated by , say , one light day so the state @xmath58 which we choose today can be sent back to appear yesterday . 
 can we use this device to send a message to our earlier selves ? 
 unfortunately , we can not . 
 the state @xmath58 appears yesterday only if the detectors d0 and d1 detect zero and one photons respectively and we have no control over what they will detect . 
 if they detect one and zero photons respectively , which is just as likely , then the state @xmath69 that appears yesterday is @xmath70 . 
 if they both detect zero photons then @xmath71 
 . if they detect a total of two photons then @xmath72 . 
 thus in the absence of preknowledge of what will be detected the best we can do is to send a mixed state back . 
 this mixed state is the sum of the density matrices representing the four possible states @xmath69 weighted by the probabilities of them occurring . 
 a formal calculation of this mixed state and of the quantum information it can carry shows that zero information can be transmitted to the past . 
 this may seem a little surprising because , if we could measure the state @xmath73 sometimes we might find @xmath74 or @xmath75 , which we could ignore , but on a sizeable number of occasions we would find @xmath76 or @xmath70 from which we could calculate the ratio @xmath57 which could be the number of the winner of a horse race . 
 unfortunately , to determine the state @xmath69 with any reasonable precision , we need a large of identical copies of it . 
 this can not be done by cloning and , as we have noted above , our lack of control over the outcomes of d0 and d1 prevents us from sending identical copies back . 
 what use is an uncontrollable time machine if the lack of control is such as to prevent us sending any information back in time ? even though we can not control it we do , however , send something back . 
 further , we do _ know _ what we have sent back . thus it might be possible to use such a device to examine a causal loop associated with a time travel paradox . 
 specifically , let us consider the robot cycle described in the introduction . 
 the robot enters a time machine today in a particular state @xmath77 and is sent back in time to yesterday . upon emerging from the time machine yesterday 
 it enters a rejuvenator which adjusts its state and programs it to walk around for a day and then to enter the time machine in precisely the state @xmath77 . 
 although the robot exists only during the cycle , the cycle is not isolated from the rest of the world . as well as there being a need to build and adjust the time machine and rejuvenator , the robot itself will leave footprints as it enters the time machine . 
 these footprints will provide evidence of the existence of the robot as well as providing information about its properties , for example its size . 
 the action of the rejuvenator on the robot may depend on properties of the robot itself . if the rejuvenator fails to program the robot to be in the state @xmath77 today , either because of bad adjustment or because of some property of the robot 
 , then we have an inconsistency . 
 according to the principle of self consistency only self - consistent loops are possible , so in this case there would be no footprints associated with this particular type of robot entering the time machine . the adjustment of the rejuvenator might , however , be suitable to provide a self - consistent cycle for a different robot , say a small robot . in this case , the need for consistency would not eliminate this cycle and any footprints left would be small .     from the lower beam splitter is directed through a phase shifter ps and via a fully reflecting mirror to become the input light in state @xmath78 at the input of the upper beam splitter.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    our aim is to use the double beam splitter device to examine closed cycles . 
 classically if the rejuvenator programs the robot to be in a state today even slightly different from @xmath77 , an inconsistency arises because we regard different classical states as effectively orthogonal . 
 this is justifiable to the extent that , in quantum mechanical terms , even if one particle of the robot is in an orthogonal state to what it should be then the complete state of the robot is orthogonal to what it should be . for simpler quantum mechanical systems , however , the distinction is not as clear cut . 
 here we have the possibility of complete self - consistency if the two states under consideration are identical and of complete inconsistency if these states are orthogonal . in between 
 we have states that are not identical but not orthogonal . 
 we shall see the effect of this later . to create a consistent cycle we wish to allow the field in state @xmath69 at @xmath26 to evolve forward in time until , at @xmath24 , it is in the state @xmath79 entering the input port of bsu in mode @xmath38 . 
 to do this we create a feedback loop with fully reflecting mirrors while keeping the two path lengths between bsl and bsu equal , as shown in fig . 
 3 . again , for simplicity , we assume both these path lengths are an integer number of wavelengths . in order to experiment with consistent and inconsistent cycles we also insert a phase shifter into the feedback part of the cycle . 
 this acts as our adjustable rejuvenator . introducing the other part of the loop in fig . 
 3 removes the controllable preparation device which prepares @xmath79 in fig . 
 2 so we no longer have the control we had to choose the ratio @xmath56 . 
 the only preparation devices are now p0 and p1 . from conservation of energy , this means that a total of only one photon can be detected by d0 and d1 . 
 also , from symmetry , the photon should have an equal probability of being found in mode _ b _ and in the mode containing the phase shifter if we were to try to detect photons in these modes . 
 that is , there should be a probability of 1/2 of finding the photon in either mode . 
 we can ensure this by letting @xmath80 . 
 the effect of applying a phase shift @xmath81 to the field in state @xmath82 is to change it from @xmath83 to @xmath84 so @xmath69 will evolve to the state @xmath85 at time @xmath48 thus by adjusting the value of @xmath81 to zero or an integer multiple of @xmath86 , we can make the rejuvenator work perfectly and obtain the consistency requirement @xmath87 @xmath88 . for a general value of @xmath81 
 , we obtain the projection @xmath89/2 . 
 \label{e11}\ ] ] by setting @xmath90 we see that ( [ e11 ] ) vanishes , so @xmath91 is _ orthogonal _ to @xmath58 . in this case 
 we can say that the rejuvenated state is definitely not the state required for a self - consistent cycle . 
 the principle of self consistency would then imply that this closed cycle is impossible . 
 the outcome or `` footprints '' associated with this particular cycle , that is , d0 and d1 measuring zero and one photons respectively , should thus never be observed . 
 let us now keep @xmath90 and examine the cycle we would obtain associated with the other outcome that d0 and d1 measure one and zero photons respectively . 
 this is the only other possible outcome for the closed cycle because , as noted above , a total of only one photon can be registered by d0 and d1 . 
 we then find , in place of ( [ e6 ] ) that    @xmath92    we find that projecting @xmath58 onto ( [ e12 ] ) gives us the retrodictive state @xmath93 at @xmath48 this state evolves backwards in time to @xmath94 at @xmath26 because the mode _ b _ path is an integer number of wavelengths . 
 projecting this onto the prepared entangled state @xmath43 gives , after normalization and removal of the undetectable factor , the state @xmath95 this leads to @xmath96 we see that for this case we do have a self - consistent cycle , with associated `` footprints '' being d0 and d1 measuring one and zero photons respectively . 
 thus there is no reason on the basis of the principle of self consistency to eliminate this cycle . on the other hand 
 if we set @xmath97 we find for this case that @xmath98 so we have an inconsistent cycle so there should be no chance of d0 and d1 measuring one and zero photons respectively for this setting of @xmath81 . 
 we have seen that if we use the only output measure we have , that is what d0 and d1 detect , as a `` probability meter '' for a cycle occurring , then the principle of self consistency implies that we can adjust the setting of @xmath99 to make one or other of the two possible measurement outcomes impossible . while this is really all we can talk about classically , in quantum mechanics we also have intermediate cases . 
 for example , what happens if we choose @xmath100 ? 
 in this case there would be some incomplete overlap of @xmath58 and @xmath101 we might expect that we could extend the principle of self consistency such that the probability for the cycle occurring is@xmath102 . 
 thus on repeating the experiment a large number of times , in some of cases the footprints for one cycle would be found , for example d0 and d1 measuring one and zero photons respectively , and for the remaining cases the alternative footprints would be found . 
 the next question is whether or not we should build the uncontrollable time machine with the feedback loop to investigate experimentally the principle of self consistency , that is , to check if we do indeed find it impossible for d0 and d1 to detect zero and one photons respectively if @xmath90 . 
 fortunately there is no need actually to do the experiment because what we have shown in fig . 
 3 is essentially a mach - zehnder interferometer for which we know the results . 
 as shown below , these confirm that d0 and d1 do not detect zero and one photons respectively if @xmath90 and do not detect one and zero photons respectively if @xmath97 . 
 even more fortunately , we can explain how the mach - zehnder interferometer works in terms of interference of quantum mechanical amplitudes in the usual predictive formalism of quantum mechanics . 
 essentially there are two paths by which a photon from p1 in fig . 
 3 can be detected by d1 , that is , via the mode _ b _ path and via the phase shifter path . 
 these two paths are the two components of the cycle . 
 we might think of the photon being reflected by bsl and then transmitted by bsu or as being transmitted by bsl and reflected by bsu . 
 the amplitude for reflection @xmath103 by bsl into mode _ b _ is the coefficient of @xmath104 in ( [ e5 ] ) , that is @xmath105 likewise the transmission amplitude for bsu is the coefficient of @xmath106 on ( [ e5 ] ) , that is , @xmath107 thus the compound amplitude for reaching d1 via mode _ b _ is @xmath108 . 
 the transmission amplitude for bsl is also @xmath109 and phase shifter introduces another factor @xmath110 so the amplitude of being transmitted and reaching bsu is @xmath111 . 
 the reflection amplitude for bsu is also @xmath112 the compound amplitude for reaching d1 via the mode containing the phase shifter is @xmath113 . 
 the _ total _ 
 amplitude for detection of the photon by d1 is then @xmath114/2 . 
 \label{e15}\ ] ]    if @xmath90 the amplitude for one path is the negative of the amplitude for the other path and the total amplitude , and therefore the probability for d1 to detect a photon , is zero . if @xmath115 however , the amplitudes for these two paths add constructively , giving a unit probability for detection . 
 we note that the probability obtained by squaring the modulus of ( [ e15 ] ) is equal to@xmath116 these results confirm the principle of self consistency for this particular case _ and _ its extension that the probability for footprints associated with the cycle occurring is@xmath117 . 
 these results indicate that we should look to quantum mechanical _ amplitudes _ , rather than probabilities , in seeking the physical mechanism underlying the impossibility of inconsistent cycles , that is , in understanding how physics sorts things out and arrives at a consistent cycle . for a causal closed cycle 
 , we can choose the earliest event and the latest event , which is associated with the footprints for example , and then regard the two parts of the cycle as two different ways of reaching the latest event , or footprints , from the earliest event . 
 indeed , we could also regard the cycle as two different ways of reaching the earliest event from the latest event . 
 if the amplitudes associated with the two parts completely interfere then the total amplitude associated with the cycle is zero and the probability for the cycle occurring is zero , that is , it is impossible . 
 constructive interference , however , renders the cycle possible . for simple quantum systems , there are intermediate cases between completely destructive and completely constructive interference , so the probability for some cycles will be somewhere between zero and unity . 
 there only needs to be a slight difference in two states of a macroscopic object , for example if the two states are identical except for the states of just one particle of the object which are orthogonal , to make the macroscopic states orthogonal themselves . 
 consequently we usually consider classical cycles as being either consistent or inconsistent . 
 the possibility of inconsistent closed causal cycles has been used as an argument against the possibility of backward time travel@xmath118 against this , the principle of self consistency has been proposed which states that physics sorts things out so that inconsistent cycles are impossible anyway , so any closed cycles must be consistent . 
 if this principle is correct then the possibility of closed cycles is not a valid argument against backward time travel . 
 this principle , however , opens up another question - how does physics sort out things so that only consistent cycles occur ? in this paper we have examined this question in the light of a device which can be interpreted , in terms of the retrodictive formalism of quantum mechanics , as an uncontrollable time machine . 
 a known state of light @xmath79 at the input of a beam splitter at time @xmath24 is sent into the past and then allowed to evolve into the future so that at time @xmath24 it is in state @xmath78 at the input of the beam splitter . because the device is interpretable in usual predictive quantum theory as an interferometer , we can calculate the probability of the cycle occurring and leaving its particular footprints to be @xmath119 . 
 this means that the probability of the cycle occurring , as observed by its footprints , is unity if @xmath91 is the same state as @xmath58 and is zero if @xmath78 is orthogonal to @xmath79 . 
 the former case is a self consistent cycle and the latter is an inconsistent cycle . 
 these results _ confirm _ the principle of self consistency for this particular case . 
 furthermore , the results allow a possible extension of the principle , which is essentially classical , to quantum mechanics to say that the probability of a cycle occurring can be found by calculating the quantum evolution of the state around the cycle , which involves evolution both backwards and forwards in time , to find the evolved state at the starting point . 
 the probability of the cycle is then given by the square of the modulus of the projection of the evolved state onto the original state . 
 if what we have found for the cycle we have studied can be applied to all cycles , then we have an underlying quantum mechanical explanation of the principle of self consistency . essentially , 
 if we work in terms of quantum mechanical amplitudes rather than probabilities , we can select the latest and earliest events on the cycle and then say that the amplitude for reaching the latest event from the earliest event has two terms , corresponding to the two different pathways to the later event . for inconsistent cycles these two amplitudes cancel each other when added . 
 for consistent cycles , they interfere constructively . 
 the probability of the cycle is the square of the modulus of the total amplitude and thus fully inconsistent cycles have a probability of zero of occurring , that is , they are impossible . 
 even slightly different classical states , that is quantum states of macroscopic objects , can be orthogonal so these slight differences induced by evolution around the cycle can render the cycle impossible . 
 classical cycles are thus usually regarded as consistent or inconsistent . 
 it is not totally surprising that a principle applying to classical physics has a quantum mechanical basis . 
 the classical principle of least action can be explained in terms of the addition of amplitudes associated with all possible paths . 
 the amplitudes for all paths except for those in the region of the path of least action cancel , so the probability for finding that the system has taken a path not near the path of least action is zero @xcite . 
 this explains how the system `` knows '' to take the path of least action . in this paper 
 we suggest that closed causal cycles are sorted out by a similar mechanism . 
 only those cycles with a net non - zero amplitude have a non - zero probability of occurring and these are the consistent cycles . in conclusion , rather than just being invoked to save the possibility of the present shaping the past , it now seems that the principle of self consistency could well have a solid physical basis in quantum mechanics .

68,"in mesoscopic systems , the measurement of current and noise makes it possible to probe the effective charges which flow in conductors , and opens the possibility for studying the role of the statistics in stationary quantum transport experiments . 
 this has been illustrated experimentally and theoretically in both cases where the interaction between electrons is less important@xcite or when it is more relevant@xcite . 
 the present work deals with the study of photo - assisted shot noise in a specific one dimensional correlated system : a hall bar in the fractional hall regime , for which charge transport occurs via two counter - propagating chiral edges states .    over the years , the attention has been focusing also on the transport properties of systems on which an external harmonic perturbation is acting . 
 a fundamental step is first to study the current response . 
 for instance , it is possible to generate a dc current by applying voltage gates on which an ac perturbation is acting @xcite . here 
 we consider the superposition of a dc bias with a time dependent perturbation . for normal and superconducting systems , 
 it has been shown@xcite that the photo - assisted shot noise allows to retrieve information on the finite frequency noise , which was computed for ballistic systems@xcite , and measured in diffusive metallic wires @xcite . 
 such finite frequency measurements turn out to be challenging in practice . on the other hand , 
 if an experiment is devoted to zero frequency noise , information on the finite frequency noise spectrum can be retrieved provided that the system has an added , external , finite frequency perturbation . in particular , the presence of a small , additional harmonic perturbation modifies the phase of the charge carriers ( reflection / transmission probabilities are affected to a lesser extent ) , and in some sense it acts as a probe to study the finite frequency noise spectrum of the conductor . 
 note that the external modulation can either be imposed on a gate voltage , located in the vicinity of the conductor , which controls the transparency of the barrier . 
 this corresponds to the gedanken experiment for the traversal time in tunneling@xcite and to the early proposals for photo - assisted shot noise@xcite . at the same time 
 , the transport properties of an irradiated point contact@xcite have also been studied with this point of view . 
 alternatively , the modulation can be imposed from the leads to which the system is connected , which may be simpler to achieve in experiments , because no additional gating is required . for non - interacting electrons , it has been shown@xcite that the derivative of the current noise with respect to the bias exhibits evenly spaced steps whose height is specified by bessel functions . 
 this result  which was derived using scattering theory  has been generalized to diffusive metallic wires using known random matrix theory results and has been tested experimentally for normal diffusive metals@xcite and recently for ballistic samples in a point contact geometry@xcite . 
 one then enquires whether electronic correlations will play an important role on the photo - assisted shot noise characteristics . in multichannel conductors described by a scattering theory , transport properties ( current and noise ) 
 have been analyzed while taking into account screening in a self - consistent treatment@xcite . for a normal metal 
 superconducting junction biased in the andreev regime , the correlations in the superconductor are responsible for a doubling of the electron charge in the shot noise @xcite . 
 the noise derivative with respect to bias voltage then exhibits steps whose spacing contains the charge of a cooper pair , as confirmed by recent experiments@xcite . 
 nevertheless , one can argue that ns systems are not so far from free electron systems , as these can be modeled by a scattering theory in which electrons are converted in hole and vice versa@xcite . 
 another possible ground for studying the effect of interactions is to consider a one  dimensional correlated electron system  a luttinger liquid . 
 reduced dimensionality is known to affect drastically the current - voltage characteristics @xcite . 
 the finite frequency current response of a one dimensional wire has been discussed in ref . , while the effect of a localized time dependent perturbation on the conductance of a non - chiral luttinger liquid was addressed recently in ref . . 
 the noise spectrum of a hall bar in the fractional hall regime was presented in ref . . 
 here we choose the same model as the latter , mainly a simple fractional quantum hall fluid consisting of two edge states with a point contact . 
 the potential difference between the two edges has both a dc and an ac component . 
 the time average current flowing in this system has been discussed using a semi - classical approach in ref . . here 
 , we concentrate on the shot noise in both the weak and strong backscattering regimes . 
 it is expected that the step like behavior of non interacting electrons will be strongly modified when the electron filling factor @xmath2 deviates from @xmath3 . 
 it is also expected that in the weak backscattering regime , the fractional charge @xmath4 probed by dc shot noise experiments@xcite should appear explicitly : the spacing between singularities in the shot noise should be given by the josephson frequency @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the dc bias voltage . 
 yet this remains to be shown in a first principles calculation . 
 the paper is organized as follows . 
 the model hamiltonian is presented in the next section , and the weak backscattering limit is considered in sec . 
 3 . results for the strong backscattering limit are collected in sec . 
 5 deals with the results using the refermionization procedure at filling factor @xmath1 . 
 consider first a fractional quantum hall bar . 
 the right and left moving chiral excitations are described by the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath7 with @xmath8 for right and left movers . 
 we adopt the simple , intuitive picture where depending on the strength of the impurity , either quasiparticles tunnel through the ( single ) quantum hall fluid , or the impurity is so strong that the fluid is split into two , and only electrons can tunnel from one fluid to the other@xcite . 
 this picture has been sucessful in explaining the main features of transport in both regimes for the quantum hall bar@xcite . in the case of a weak impurity 
 , the backscattering of quasiparticles is described by the tunneling hamitonian : @xmath9^{(\varepsilon)}~ , \label{tunneling_hamiltonian}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the notation @xmath10 specifies the operator ( @xmath11 ) or its hermitian ( complex ) conjugate ( @xmath12 ) as in ref .  . 
 let @xmath13 be the bare tunneling amplitude , and @xmath14 be the total ( dc and ac ) potential drop at the junction . here , one has the choice of either including this voltage in the properties of the fractional edges , or to take this voltage into account using a gauge transformation . 
 indeed , one can choose a gauge where the electric field at the junction is fully specified by a _ 
 potential only . 
 this procedure is called the peierls substitution . 
 the quasiparticle field operator then acquires a phase which is tied to the gauge transformation function @xmath15 . 
 the corresponding hopping amplitude thus becomes : @xmath16 note that the charge which appears in the phase factor is the fractional charge @xmath4 corresponding to edge state quasiparticles . 
 this choice is justified in the weak backscattering regime , where quasiparticles tunnel through the quantum hall fluid . 
 in addition , from the dc and ac voltage amplitudes , it is convenient to introduce new frequencies which include this anomalous charge : @xmath17 with this choice , the phase factor of the tunneling amplitude reads @xmath18 . in eq . 
 ( [ tunneling_hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath19 is the quasiparticle field associated to the left ( @xmath20 ) or right ( @xmath21 ) movers . it can be expressed in term of the bosonic chiral field @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the klein factor , which does not play any role in this lowest order calculation ( because @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 is the short distance cutoff .    7 cm 
 the backscattering current can be calculated using @xmath27 . 
 the calculation method of the current follows closely that of refs . . 
 for the voltage modulation , this means that the current operator reads : @xmath28^{(\varepsilon)}~,\end{aligned}\ ] ] for simplicity we set @xmath29 . using the keldysh formulation of non equilibrium transport , 
 the average current is expressed as a time ordered contour : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the keldysh index and the notation @xmath32 refers to the keldysh contour . 
 expanding to lowest order in @xmath13 and taking into account quasiparticle conservation , the bosonized expressions for the quasiparticle fields are employed , together with the definition of the chiral green s function @xcite : @xmath33 and the backscattering current associated with an ( arbitrary ) time dependent perturbation becomes : @xmath34 assume now that the bias voltage is modulated by a harmonic perturbation . using the generating function of the bessel function as in ref . 
 , @xmath35=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}j_n(\omega_1/\omega)e^{in\omega t}$ ] , which is a signature of most photo - assisted processes , the tunnel amplitude is cast into an infinite sum : @xmath36 which gives : @xmath37 the change of variables @xmath38 with @xmath39 has been operated . 
 note that only @xmath40 terms in eq . 
 ( [ etaeta1 ] ) contribute to the first integral because of the symmetry properties of the green s function . on the contrary , 
 only @xmath41 terms contribute to the second integral because such an integral does not depend on @xmath31 . 
 using the expression for the green s function eq.([green ] ) , the current can thus be split into two contributions , with integrants containing either a sine or a cosine of @xmath42 . 
 the time integral can be performed analytically and is expressed in terms of the gamma function @xmath43 ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) . 
 grouping the two contributions , we obtain : @xmath44    the fourier transform of the current , @xmath45 , yields : @xmath46    to zero order in the amplitude @xmath47 of the modulation , we recover the i - v characteristics of the pure stationary regime ( @xmath48 ) : @xmath49    expanding the current to first order with @xmath47 corresponds to @xmath50 and @xmath51 or to @xmath52 and @xmath53 : @xmath54~.\end{aligned}\ ] ]    in the limit @xmath55 , eqs . 
 ( [ ordre1 ] ) and ( [ ordre2 ] ) lead , at zero and first orders with @xmath47 , to the backscattering current : @xmath56    finally , one can analyze which dc contribution is provided by the ac modulation : the rectification property . 
 this information is contained in the zero - frequency fourier transform : @xmath57 which is obtained to all orders in the modulation . also note that it can be re - expressed in terms of the dc current : 
 @xmath58 a general relation which was noticed in ref . . 
 first , note that the result of eq . 
 ( [ real_time_current ] ) seems to blow up at @xmath1 . in this situation , 
 the absolute value in the last term of this equation becomes independent of @xmath59 and the term proportional to @xmath60 vanishes at @xmath1 . 
 consider now the case of arbitrary @xmath2 . 
 for the present result to be valid , one should be consistent with the assumption of weak backscattering , and the differential conductance should thus be much smaller than the conductance quantum @xmath61 associated with the unperturbed fractional edge : @xmath62 first , consider the limit of a weak ac perturbation @xmath63 . in this case , the zero order current given by eq . 
 ( [ ordre1 ] ) dominates and , @xmath64 in particular , for @xmath55 , the condition of validity of perturbation theory yields : @xmath65 which is independent of @xmath66 , and which simply states that electron transport along the edge dominates over backscattering contributions .    for laughlin fractions which have @xmath67 
 , the backscattering current diverges at low bias ( the known `` paradox '' of luttinger liquids ) , and the validity condition for a weak ac modulation reads : @xmath68    one can also derive a validity condition if the limit where @xmath69 is arbitrary . 
 the starting point is to rewrite eq . 
 ( [ real_time_current ] ) by resumming over the integer variable @xmath70 : @xmath71 every time @xmath66 
 approaches @xmath72 , the backscattering current @xmath73 diverges because of the quasiparticle density of states exponent @xmath74 . 
 if one treats all these divergences ( for different @xmath59 ) independently , one can derive a _ sufficient _ condition for the validity of eq . 
 ( [ real_time_current ] ) : @xmath75 note that this condition looks quite similar to the one derived for the weak ac modulation , except for the shift @xmath72 on the voltage bias .    in the following section , a series of plots ( figs . 
 [ fig2]-[fig5 ] ) displays the zero frequency component of the current , the noise and the noise derivative with respect to bias all as a function of the ratio @xmath76 , for various filling factors . 
 the divergences on these plots should be understood to be unphysical outside the limits specified by eq . 
 ( [ limitation ] ) . outside these limits , 
 one expects a crossover to the strong backscattering regime , in analogy with the renormalization group analysis of ref . 
 for the stationary situation . 
 the symmetrized backscattering current noise correlator is expressed with the help of the keldysh contour : @xmath77 here one is interested in the poissonian limit only , so in the weak backscattering case , one collects the second order contribution in the tunnel barrier amplitude @xmath78 , and the product of the average backscattering current can be dropped . 
 the meaning of the poissonian limit is that quasiparticles which tunnel from one edge to another do so in an independent manner . 
 yet by doing so they can absorb or emit @xmath59 `` photon '' quanta of @xmath79 ( @xmath59 integer ) . 
 ( [ noise_definition ] ) is our definition of the real time correlator , but this choice is not necessarily obvious . 
 indeed , it has been pointed out in ref .   that the choice of correlator  symmetrized or non symmetrized  depends on how the noise measurement is performed . 
 more recently , ref . has argued that the non 
 symmetrized correlator corresponds to what is actually probed at finite frequencies , provided that the detector which is used to measure the noise is set at sufficiently low temperatures . in the dc regime 
 however , it is well understood that such differences do not matter , as long as one considers zero frequency noise . in the present work , 
 the origin for off - equilibrium phenomena comes from both a dc bias and an ac drive . 
 the latter effect breaks time translational invariance , so that the finite frequency noise involves in general two frequencies@xcite : @xmath80 here , one of the main purpose of this work is to analyze the noise when both frequencies @xmath81 and @xmath82 are set to zero , because the presence of the ac perturbation mimics at finite frequency noise measurement . for zero frequencies , 
 it is therefore justified to use the symmetrized correlator of eq . 
 ( [ noise_definition ] ) . 
 the quasiparticle correlators have already been calculated for the backscattering current , therefore in terms of chiral green s functions the real time correlator becomes : @xmath83 the double fourier transform of the real time noise correlator then reads : @xmath84 changing to relative time coordinates @xmath85 and @xmath86 , one obtains two contributions whose time integrals can be factored out , and the time integrals can be performed ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) : @xmath87 in particular , the case where both frequencies are set to zero can serve as a point of comparison with experiments : @xmath88 note that this quantity is obtained in perturbation theory but it contains _ all _ orders in the harmonic perturbation .    the results are now illustrated and discussed . the quantities which are plotted on figs . 
 [ fig2 ] to [ fig6 ] are normalized according to the prefactors which appear on eqs . 
 ( [ zerofrequencycurrent ] ) and ( [ zerofrequencynoise ] ) . at @xmath55 , 
 one recovers ( fig . 
 [ fig2 ] ) the results of ref . . 
 the noise derivative with respect to @xmath66 has a step - like behavior , with steps located at @xmath89 , ( @xmath70 integer ) , and the step heights are related to the weight @xmath90 . 
 the zero frequency fourier transform of the current does not display any structure at the step locations for the noise : it is simply linear . 
 7 cm    for lower values of the filling factor , electronic correlations modify this behavior drastically . generally speaking , the power law behavior @xmath91 should have a `` stronger '' singularity for lower filling factors . for the fractional quantum hall effect , 
 only odd fractions are allowed for @xmath2 . 
 the results are illustrated with filling factor @xmath92 , which represents the correlated state which is `` easiest '' to access experimentally@xcite . 
 7 cm    first , one observes that contrary to the free electron case , the zero frequency fourier transform of the current displays singularities every time @xmath76 reaches an integer value ( fig . 
 [ fig3 ] ) . 
 such singularities reflect the tunneling density of states of the quasiparticles , in a similar manner which is observed in the backscattering current 
 voltage characteristics@xcite . 
 nevertheless , one should remember that the present calculation is only valid in the weak backscattering regime : the current @xmath93 whose fourier transform is displayed in fig . 
 [ fig3 ] , should be much lower than the maximal current along the fractional edge as it is discussed in section [ validity ] . 
 next , the noise ( for both frequencies set to zero ) is plotted as a function of bias . while at @xmath55 , the noise was found to be a continuous function of @xmath66 ( with discontinuous derivatives ) , for @xmath92 it displays evenly spaced singularities as for the current ( fig . 
 [ fig4 ] ) .    7 cm    note that the spacing between singular points can serve as a diagnosis for the effective charges at play , as in the dc shot noise experiments : recall that the effective charge @xmath4 is implicit in the definition of @xmath66 . 
 measured at a given , fixed amplitude for the noise , the peaks widths get reduced as @xmath94 is increased : on the figure it becomes difficult to resolve this width beyond @xmath95 . 
 the present results bear strong similarities with the finite frequency noise of ref . 
 ( 17 ) ) , which was computed in the absence of an ac bias . 
 in fact eq . 
 ( [ two_frequencies ] ) contains these previous results . in the absence of the ac bias ( @xmath96 ) 
 , only @xmath48 remains in eq . 
 ( [ two_frequencies ] ) , giving a dependence @xmath97 . using the definition of the double fourier transform , 
 one identifies @xmath81 as the frequency where the noise is computed in ref . . 
 indeed , in the absence of an ac bias , time translational invariance is restored and this frequency is the only relevant one , and one gets the same density of states divergences as for the dc , finite frequency noise . 
 the interesting feature in the present work is that when one considers the ac driven noise , with both frequencies set to zero , one recovers information on a dc , finite frequency measurement . 
 another point of comparison is the ( unphysical ) value @xmath1 : although this filling factor does not correspond to a laughlin fraction , it allows to make a connection with an exact solution using the refermionization procedure @xcite ( sec . 
 the backscattering current noise shows no structure : this noise is perfectly flat with respect to the bias voltage because of the tunneling density of states exponents . on the other hand , the zero - frequency current displays steps as a function of @xmath76 ( fig . 
 [ fig5 ] ) . here 
 , one can make a direct comparison between the zero frequency noise derivative at @xmath55 and the zero fourier transform of the current at @xmath1 : the frequency exponents for both quantities turn out to be the same , and the bessel coefficients which appear in front of these terms are also identical , in eqs . 
 ( [ zero_frequency_fourier_current ] ) and ( [ zero_frequency_noise ] ) .    7 cm 
 the results of the preceding section can be straightforwardly extended to treat the limit of strong backscattering , by appealing to the duality relation between the weak and strong backscattering limits . 
 indeed , the action of a gate voltage separates the fractional quantum hall fluid into two components , between which only electrons can tunnel . the main changes to operate on the preceding results are in the tunneling operator , as the fields now represent normal electrons . 
 this corresponds to the substitution : @xmath98 this yields for the electron tunneling current and noise : @xmath99    @xmath100    in particular , for zero frequencies , @xmath101    7 cm    the results are displayed in fig . 
 [ fig6 ] . on the one hand 
 , one can expect that the photo - assisted shot noise should bear similarities with the free electron case because the charge carriers which tunnel from one quantum hall fluid to the other are electrons . on the other hand 
 , the transport occurs between two correlated electron systems with a vanishing tunneling density of states . here 
 , we see that the photo - assisted shot noise is a smooth function of @xmath76 . 
 this suggests that the strong backscattering regime does not offer any straightforward diagnosis for effective charges as in the weak backscattering case . 
 finally , for the sake of completeness , we mention that for fractional quantum hall systems in the strong backscattering regime , super - poissonian noise has been observed in dc shot noise measurements . 
 indeed , it has been shown that @xcite at sufficiently low temperatures , the effective charge which tunnels from one quantum hall fluid to the other , as analyzed by the ratio @xmath102 , can be equal to @xmath103 or can be even larger . 
 these experiments suggest that the relevant tunneling process involves pairs  or groups  of electrons . from the point of view of our model , this means that one should take into account the tunneling of such pairs , while an inspection of the renormalization group equations tells us that such processes should be less relevant than the bare electron tunneling term . while this topic is still under debate , and has no simple theoretical explanation for the dc shot noise , here can only give a schematic picture of what will happen for the photo - assisted shot noise . in the above 
 , one recalls that the vanishing of the density of states for single electron tunneling in a luttinger liquid is the reason why photo - assisted shot noise does not display any sharp features for the strong backscattering regime . 
 the density of states for two electron tunneling is expected to vanish with an exponent @xmath104 , i.e. much faster than the single electron case . 
 we thus expect no sharp features to show up in the photo  assisted shot noise at integer values of @xmath76 . 
 in order to gain further insights for the backscattering current away from the tunneling regime , we study the limit @xmath1 where it is possible to refermionize . 
 the various chiral current correlators which appear in the calculation of the dc backscattering noise and in the dc shot noise have been computed in this manner in ref . . 
 the refermionized model involves the combinations of edge state densities : @xmath105 @xmath106 describes a free boson theory , whereas boundary and scattering effects are included in the solution for the fermion field operator @xmath107 which specifies @xmath108 . 
 the hamiltonian which specifies the dynamics of this latter field is : @xmath109 \psi(x ) + \sqrt{2\pi}\delta(x)[\gamma_0   \psi^\dagger(x)f+\gamma_0^ *   f\psi(x)]\right\}~,\ ] ] were @xmath110 is a majorana fermion which satisfies @xmath111 and commutes with @xmath107 . note that the total bias voltage appears explicitly in the hamiltonian because a gauge transformation has been used on @xmath107 . in the presence of an ac voltage modulation , 
 the heisenberg equations of motion become : @xmath112    the general solutions allow for a mismatch of the field operators at the impurity location : @xmath113    the matching condition for the @xmath114 and @xmath115 are obtained by integrating the equations of motion over the singularity : @xmath116 + 2i\pi\gamma_0 ^ 2 [ \psi(0_+,t)+\psi(0_-,t)-\psi^\dag(0_+,t)-\psi^\dag(0_-,t)]=0   ~. \label{matching_condition}\end{aligned}\ ] ] this condition does not contain the dc voltage , nor the time dependent drive . 
 one then substitutes the general solution for @xmath117 in the latter equation , and subsequently , one uses the generating function of the bessel function to obtain a the general relationship between the fourier components @xmath118 s and @xmath119 s . 
 the details of this calculation are explicited in appendix [ appendixb ] . 
 note that unlike ref . 
 , the presence of the harmonic perturbation couples the fourier components at different frequencies . because here , we are interested in obtaining the modulation of the backscattering current as a first step , it is sufficient to solve such equation to @xmath120 . @xmath121 and @xmath122 
 are given by eqs . 
 ( [ bbbb ] ) and ( [ bbbbdag ] ) . 
 this completes the refermionization procedure in the presence of the harmonic time perturbation . 
 note that a previous work on the photo - assisted current in the same geometry@xcite claims to have a general result for this situation , arguing that the ac modulation can be gauged - out by the transformation : @xmath123 . here , we note that the matching conditions used for this new field is : @xmath124 + 2i\pi\gamma_0 ^ 2 [ \tilde{\psi}(0_+,t)+\tilde{\psi}(0_-,t)-\tilde{\psi}^\dag(0_+,t)-\tilde{\psi}^\dag(0_-,t)]=0   ~ , \end{aligned}\ ] ] so the matching condition itself becomes time dependent with this choice of gauge , because of the harmonic perturbation . 
 this time contribution was discarded in ref . . 
 the average backscattering current can be expressed in terms of the fermion density as follows : @xmath125 the details of the calculation are explained in appendix [ appendixb ] . the general result for 
 the backscattering current reads : @xmath126 which is the final result for the backscattering current computed using the refermionization procedure , to first order in the harmonic perturbation . 
 the perturbative result of eq . 
 ( [ ordre2 ] ) can be recovered by choosing the limit @xmath127 , @xmath128 : @xmath129 we thus recover the perturbative result of eqs .

 photo  assisted shot noise makes it possible to probe the transport properties of mesoscopic conductors in the time domain , as it is provides information which is directly related to the spectral density of noise . 
 so far , such information has mainly focused on mesoscopic conductors where electron - electron interactions do not intervene , except via screening effects in the rpa approximation@xcite . 
 the present study deals with the possible diagnosis of the `` simplest '' one dimensional correlated electron systems  a fractional quantum hall bar with two counter - propagating edge excitations  and showed in particular that the singularities in the noise and current provide information on the effective charges corresponding to laughlin fractions for the quantum hall fluid . 
 although the present work bears close ties with previous work on finite frequency noise@xcite in the fractional quantum hall effect , a first principle derivation of photo - assisted shot noise in these systems was still lacking .    the bulk of the present results were derived in the context of perturbation theory , using two opposite limits ( weak and strong backscattering ) and shows that a direct diagnosis of quasiparticle tunneling can be reached for weak backscattering situations , while in the limit of strong backscattering , one does not expect much of a structure in the photo - assisted shot noise . for a correlated electron state such as @xmath92 , 
 the noise and backscattering current for a weak impurity contain singularities at integer values of the fraction @xmath76 . at finite temperatures however , these singularities will be smeared out and the peak heights should scale as @xmath130 as in ref . , while they will also acquire thermal broadening . 
 the condition for resolving the peaks in then @xmath131 , similarly to the temperature crossover of the dc regime . if one is to compare this diagnosis with the measurement of the fano factor in a dc shot noise measurement with the present procedure , one can argue that the extra degree of freedom provided by the probe frequency @xmath79 facilitates the monitoring of such singularities . 
 a similar structure does not show up in the strong backscattering regime because , in this case , electron tunneling density of states are involved , rather than quasiparticle tunneling density of states . 
 this suggest that photo  assisted transport could be used to probe , in future experiments , the crossover from the strong to the weak backscattering regimes in the fractional quantum hall effect .    in order to go beyond perturbation theory , a systematic , perturbative approach in the drive amplitude , 
 was proposed , based on the refermionization procedure for @xmath1 . 
 the photo - assisted current was derived to first order in this amplitude in the present work , but generalizations of this method , concerning the study of the rectification property of the current ( its zero frequency fourier transform ) or the photo  assisted shot noise are possible in principle , but they remain a challenge because of the need to pursue the calculation to higher orders in the drive amplitude .    note that the present work treats both edges as independent entities , which are only coupled via the tunneling hamiltonian of eq . 
 ( [ tunneling_hamiltonian ] ) . 
 a more precise model would include density - density interactions between both edges in the vicinity of the impurity , for instance described by a screened coulomb interaction . 
 such interactions were considered for electron wave guides containing two coupled non - chiral luttinger liquids in section 7 of ref . , and 
 the transport properties of this system through an impurity were analyzed in ref . , assuming that the interaction is effective over the whole length of the wire . 
 here however , one focuses on a situation where the edge excitations have a chiral character . for the integer quantum hall effect 
 , the screened interaction between two electron edge states were discussed previously@xcite . 
 this interaction alone  over a finite length which characterizes the regions where the two edges are in close proximity  is understood to lead to backscattering of the collective excitations . 
 indeed , the interaction between edges will give rise to a local inhomogeneity of the luttinger liquid interaction parameter , as seen in ref .  . 
 although a full generalization to the fractional quantum hall situation is not fully available , it plausible that the same applies to the present situation . in the presence of such screened interaction , in the vicinity of the impurity , the `` proper '' excitations would mix right and left moving excitations , so that the tunneling hamiltonian and current operator would have to be rewritten in terms of new excitations which diagonalize the hamiltonian . 
 one then expects for backscattering to be enhanced by the screened coulomb interaction . 
 nevertheless , such inter - edge interaction will have a lesser role if the tunneling between the two edge states is weak , which is a working assumption of the present work . 
 in fact , such considerations should first be addressed for a dc shot noise measurement in the fqhe alone , rather than in the present work , whose goal is to focus mainly on photo - assisted transport . 
 several perspectives can be foreseen in the future . here , only simple laughlin fractions have been considered . yet 
 the present approach 
 probing transport in a correlated electron system with an external parameter ( the drive frequency )  in more complicated fractions of the quantum hall effect is highly relevant , because the charges at play depend on the geometry and the gating applied to the hall bar @xcite . 
 another possible extension of the present results concerns non - chiral luttinger liquids , which find experimental applications in semiconductor quantum wires as well as for transport through carbon nanotubes . 
 overall , photo  assisted transport constitutes a first step for studying the behavior of mesoscopic systems in non - stationary situations , which is relevant here for the understanding of the control of charge injection in the fractional quantum hall effect .

69,"since davis & peebles ( 1983 ) first analyzed the anisotropy in the galaxy distribution from center for astrophysics ( cfa ) redshift catalog , it has been recognized that the peculiar velocity field of galaxies induces a significant systematic effect in statistics of observed galaxy distributions in redshift space . in particular , virialized random motion of galaxies produces an elongated pattern of galaxy distribution along the line of sight , called _ finger - of - god_. this effect significantly suppresses the amplitude of the two - point correlation function of galaxies in redshift space , especially on scales below @xmath0mpc . 
 the proper account of this redshift - space distortion requires a detailed model for the pairwise velocity distribution function ( hereafter , pvdf ) of galaxies . 
 davis & peebles ( 1983 ) discovered that the pvdf of the cfa galaxy sample is approximately described by an exponential distribution , instead of a gaussian : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the separation length and @xmath3 denote the pairwise peculiar velocity between a pair of galaxy along the line - of - sight direction . 
 the quantity @xmath4 is the peculiar velocity dispersion ( pvd ) . 
 the exponential form of pvdf was confirmed also later by analyses of @xmath5-body simulations of dark matter particles and of other samples of galaxies ( e.g. , efstathiou et al . 
 1988 , fisher et al . 
 1994 , marzke et al . 
 1995 ) . 
 theoretical models for the origin of the exponential pvdf of dark matter were put forward by sheth ( 1996 ) and diaferio & geller ( 1996 ) , and more recently by sheth & diaferio ( 2001 ) . 
 they phenomenologically introduced a nonlinear model of pvdf using the press 
 schechter formalism . to be more specific 
 , they assume that any dark matter particle belongs to one of virialized clumps ( dark halos ) with the 1-point velocity distribution function being a maxwellian form . 
 if one considers sufficiently small scales , the particle pairs of those separations are likely to be in the same halo , and then their pvdf is approximately given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass function of dark halos , @xmath8 is the pvdf of dark matter particles within a halo of mass @xmath9 . 
 the quantity @xmath10 represents the statistical weight proportional to the number of particle pairs with separation @xmath2 in the halo : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the density profile of the halo of mass @xmath9 , and @xmath13 is the dirac delta function . adopting the singular isothermal distribution as a particular choice of the dark halo profile , sheth ( 1996 ) showed that the scale - free model of @xmath14 with @xmath15 exactly reproduces the exponential pvdf ( [ eq : exp ] ) .    while a perturbation theory ( seto & yokoyama 1998 ; juszkiewicz et al . 
 1998 ) also qualitatively explained why the gaussian initial models approach the exponential pvdf , the above model is much more successful quantitatively . 
 further , a significant influence of the finger - of - got effect appears at small scale , where the perturbative approach can not be applied . 
 therefore in the present paper , we attempt to improve the sheth ( 1996 ) model ( [ eq : shethp ] ) for the pvdf in several aspects ; first , we consider more popular cdm models instead of the scale - free power - spectra . 
 second , we adopt a series of more realistic density profiles for dark halos ( hernquist 1990 ; navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; fukushige & makino 1997 , 2001a ; moore et al . 
 1998 ; jing & suto 2000 ) . 
 third , we derive the one - point pvdf of dark matter particles in a halo directly from the abel integral of the above density profiles , instead of assuming the maxwellian form _ 
 a priori_. this approach is important since we can incorporate the scale- and mass - dependence of the pvd in a consistent fashion unlike the previous modeling . 
 finally we also apply the selection function following jing , brner & suto ( 2002 ) so as to phenomenologically attempt to predict the pvd of _ galaxies _ out of that of dark matter particles . 
 this paper is organized as follows ; section 2 describes our improved modeling for the pvdf on the basis of the dark matter halo approach . in  3 , we present the resultant pvd in various cosmological models and discuss how the underlying halo profiles are sensitive to those results . 
 we also provide a simple fitting formula of the pvd in the currently popular spatially - flat cdm model , which is useful in modeling the redshift - distortion effect . 
 then we attempt to consider the effect of the spatial biasing of galaxies relative to the dark matter particles on the pvd by applying a phenomenological biasing scheme . 
 finally section 4 is devoted to summary and conclusions . 
 our present method to compute the pvdf is schematically shown in figure [ fig : pvdf_procedure ] . 
 we will describe the details of the procedure below . throughout the paper , we consider the three representative cdm models parameterized by the density parameter @xmath16 , the dimensionless cosmological parameter @xmath17 , the amplitude of the mass fluctuation smoothed over the top - hat radius of @xmath18mpc , @xmath19 , and the hubble constant in units of 100 km / s / mpc @xmath20 ; standard cdm ( @xmath21 ; scdm ) , lambda cdm ( @xmath22 ; lcdm ) , and open cdm ( @xmath23 ; ocdm ) . 
 those models are normalized to satisfy the x - ray cluster abundances ( kitayama & suto 1997 ) . 
 ( 160mm,100mm)pvdf_procedure.eps      the density profile of dark matter halos plays a key role in our method . 
 following the recent suggestions from high - resolution numerical simulations , we adopt the following specific form : @xmath24 in the above , @xmath9 is the mass of the halo , @xmath25 is the mean density of the universe at @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the present critical density , @xmath28 is the characteristic density excess , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 indicate the virial radius and the scale radius of the halo , respectively .    the virial radius is defined 
 according to the spherical collapse model as @xmath31 we use the following expressions ( kitayama & suto 1996 ) for the critical over - density @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively given as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , in terms of the density parameter at the collapse time , @xmath38 .    in practice , we focus on three specific profiles . 
 ( i ) the original nfw profile with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( navarro et al . 
 1997 ) , ( ii ) the modified nfw profile with @xmath41 indicated by higher - resolution simulations ( fukushige & makino 1997 , 2001a , b ; moore et al . 1998 ; jing & suto 2000 ) , ( iii ) the hernquist profile with @xmath39 and @xmath42 ( hernquist 1990 ) for which the analytic expression of the phase - space distribution function is known . 
 the two parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 are not independent , and are related in terms of the concentration parameter : @xmath45 the condition that the total mass inside @xmath44 is equal to @xmath9 relates @xmath46 to @xmath47 . 
 therefore the halo mass - dependence of the above profiles is entirely specified by @xmath48 . in the case of the original nfw profile , 
 we use the approximate fitting function from the simulation data of bullock et al . 
 ( 2001 ) : @xmath49 for the other profiles , we first compute the amplitude of the two - point correlation functions of dark matter following the procedure of seljak ( 2000 ) and ma & fry ( 2000 ) , and then find the amplitude of the concentration parameter which reproduces the peacock  dodds ( 1996 ) fitting formula . 
 this calibration yield @xmath50 for the modified nfw profile ( oguri et al . 
 2001 ) , and @xmath51 for the hernquist profile , which we adopt throughout the analysis below . 
 our next task is to compute the phase - space distribution function in a single halo from the given density profile ( [ eq : univ ] ) . while sheth ( 1996 ) and sheth et al . 
 ( 2001 ) simply adopt the gaussian velocity distribution function , we eliminate this assumption and derive the velocity distribution function in a fully consistent manner .    for this purpose , we make use of the jeans theorem which states that for a spherically symmetric and stationary system , the solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation can be expressed as a function of the specific binding energy , @xmath52 , alone . here we define @xmath53 as the minus of the gravitational potential satisfying the boundary condition of @xmath54 
 .    one may wonder whether halos in hierarchical universes that should experience repeated merger and destruction continually are well approximated as stationary . 
 nevertheless natarajan , hjorth & van kampen ( 1997 ) and hanyu & habe ( 2001 ) found that the phase - space distribution function directly estimated from their particle simulations agrees well with that derived from the jeans theorem . 
 thus the above assumption is justified , at least empirically . 
 then the phase - space distribution function @xmath55 in a single halo is directly computed from its given density profile @xmath12 as follows ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) : @xmath56 figure [ fig : fe ] plots the dimensionless phase - space distribution function @xmath57 evaluated numerically from equation ( [ eq : abel ] ) , where @xmath58 is the characteristic mass of the halo and @xmath59 is the dimensionless specific energy . 
 the hernquist model has an analytical solution for @xmath55 which is reproduced by our numerical result almost within an accuracy of 2% except for the tiny region @xmath60 , where the error reaches at 7% but the effect is safely negligible for later analysis . since the three halo profiles that we adopt have a central cusp , @xmath61 diverges at a corresponding value of @xmath62 . 
 the modified nfw profile has @xmath61 which extends more broadly up to @xmath63 reflecting the stronger central concentration than that of the original nfw case . 
 ( 80mm,80mm)fe.eps      once the phase - space distribution function is given , one can also compute one - dimensional single - particle velocity distribution function along a particular direction by integrating over the other two components . assuming the isotropic velocity distribution 
 , one has @xmath64 where we project along the direction of @xmath65 and the quantity @xmath66 is the corresponding binding energy . 
 figure [ fig : f1v ] shows the dimensionless velocity distribution function @xmath67 at @xmath68 ( _ thin lines _ ) and @xmath69 ( _ thick lines _ ) , where @xmath70 is the scaling velocity . 
 the figure indicates that the one - dimensional velocity distribution function in a halo can be reasonably approximated by the gaussian : @xmath71 although it has a sharp cutoff around the escape velocity of the halo , @xmath72 .    in figure 
 [ fig : f1v ] , the dashed lines indicate the gaussian - fit which has the same velocity dispersion evaluated from equation ( [ eq : f1 ] ) . 
 it seems that the empirical gaussian approximation can reasonably reproduce the pvdf , and thus we use the approximation in the numerical integrations below so as to reduce the computational time . 
 figure [ fig : svd ] plots the velocity dispersion @xmath73 computed from the best - fit gaussian , which clearly shows the scale - dependence that was neglected in the previous analysis ( sheth 1996 ; sheth et al . 2001 ) . 
 note also the different scale - dependence from the circular velocity @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the mass inside the radius @xmath76 ( thin lines in fig.[fig : svd ] ) . in the subsequent modeling of the pvdf 
 , we use the gaussian approximation with the fitted @xmath73 rather than repeating the full numerical integration . 
 ( 160mm,100mm)f1v.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)v_c.eps      finally we are in a position to estimate the pvdf combining the above results . 
 since we are interested in small scales , the particle pairs with the corresponding separations are approximated to reside in the common halo . then sheth ( 1996 ) derived the following expression for the pvdf : @xmath77 where @xmath2 is the pair - separation and @xmath78 is the normalization factor given by @xmath79 the relation between the quantities used in the expressions ( [ eq:1pvdf ] ) and ( [ eq : normal ] ) are schematically summarized in figure [ fig : r12 ] . 
 ( 80mm,80mm)r_12.eps    while sheth ( 1996 ) adopted the singular isothermal sphere @xmath80 and therefore the maxwellian for @xmath81 with @xmath76-independent velocity dispersion , we are able to evaluate equation ( [ eq:1pvdf ] ) in more realistic situations as described in the preceding subsections .    applying the gaussian fit ( eq.[[eq : f1v ] ] ) for @xmath81 , equation ( [ eq:1pvdf ] ) is rewritten as @xmath82 \delta_d(r_{12}-|\boldsymbol{r_1}-\boldsymbol{r_2}|)\,\ ,   \delta_d(v_{12}-v_1+v_2).\end{aligned}\ ] ] the integrals over the two velocity components @xmath65 and @xmath83 , and also over the directions of the position vectors can be performed analytically , and equation ( [ eq : pvdf1 ] ) reduces to @xmath84 , \label{eq : pvdf}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the minimum mass of the halo including the pair with separation @xmath2 ( i.e. , @xmath86 ) , and the normalization factor @xmath87 is now given by @xmath88 actually it turns out that this term corresponds to the one - halo contribution of the two - point correlation function , @xmath89 , in the dark halo approach ( seljak 2000 , ma & fry 2000 ) . 
 figure [ fig : f2v ] plots the resulting pvdf ( in the lcdm model ) at @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92mpc against the pairwise velocity @xmath3 normalized by the pvd at each separation . 
 we adopt the press - schechter mass function for definiteness . 
 note that the quantitatively similar behavior is obtained for other cosmological models , but with different pvds . 
 the pvdf for small separation pairs ( @xmath93mpc ) is well described by the exponential distribution . 
 as @xmath2 increases , the central region resembles the gaussian distribution while the exponential tail is still clear at large velocities . neither the inner nor outer slope of the density profile produces any systematic difference in the non - gaussian tails of pvdf , in contrast to the single - particle velocity distribution in figure [ fig : f1v ] . 
 this qualitative behavior is in complete agreement with the result of sheth ( 1996 ) assuming the scale - free model and the singular isothermal sphere . 
 therefore we conclude that the exponential distribution of the pvdf is a rather general consequence in the gravitational instability picture fairly independent of the underlying cosmological model . 
 we have shown that the _ shape _ of the pvdf is well approximated by the exponential in a fairly insensitive manner to either the cosmological model or the dark halo density profile . 
 note , however , that this does not implies the pvd is determined independently of the cosmology , but rather it is the basic source for the cosmological model - dependence , through the mass function of halos . 
 since the pvdf is already obtained , one may evaluate the pvd @xmath4 directly as @xmath94 we note , however , that the above expression is valid only when the one - halo term @xmath95 is sufficiently larger than unity . 
 if one takes account of particle pairs residing in two different halos that we neglect in the present modeling , one should rather replace the normalization factor @xmath96 by @xmath97 since the factor physically corresponds to the relative probability of finding a pair at separation @xmath2 . 
 this consideration implies the normalization of the pvd from the one - halo contribution should be @xmath98 in fact , this agrees with equation ( 21 ) of sheth et al . ( 
 we compute the two - point correlation function , @xmath99 , on the basis of the dark halo approach ( seljak 2000 ) , and we also confirm that the resulting @xmath100 is in good agreement with the fitting formula of peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) by an appropriate choice of the concentration parameter @xmath101 as discussed in subsection [ subsec : rho ] . 
 figure [ fig : lsigma ] shows the pvd calculated according to equation ( [ eq : ndisp ] ) . 
 the comparison among the different model predictions indicates that the amplitude of pvd sensitively depends on the cosmological parameters through the mass function @xmath7 , but is almost insensitive to the density profile of dark halo . 
 note , however , that this is partly because we have chosen the value of @xmath101 so as to reproduce the same @xmath102 irrespectively of the density profile . 
 we also show the result with neglecting the scale - dependence of the velocity distribution in the case of the lcdm model ( _ long - dashed _ lines ) . 
 this indicates that the isothermal approximation ( sheth et al . 
 2001 ) is quite acceptable in predicting the pvd . 
 ( 160mm,100mm)lsigma.eps    ( 160mm,100mm)glsigma.eps    we attempted an empirical fitting to our numerical results at different redshifts ( fig.[fig : glsigma ] ) by adopting a power - law form : @xmath103 in terms of the _ comoving _ pair separation @xmath104 . 
 the values of the amplitude @xmath105 and the power - law index @xmath106 fitted for @xmath107 are listed in table  [ tab : power - law - fit ] in the lcdm model , where @xmath108 is the comoving separation at which the pvd becomes maximum . since the two - halo term @xmath109 becomes dominant contribution to @xmath100 for larger separations , equation ( [ eq : sigmafit ] ) becomes inaccurate for @xmath110 . 
 the fit is accurate within 5 % , which is comparable to the other systematic errors including the numerical integration or the gaussian approximation . 
 this result may be compared with the independent prediction based on the cosmic virial theorem ( peebles 1976 ; suto 1993 ; suto & jing 1997 ) . for reference , 
 if the correlation function of dark matter is given by @xmath111 , the cosmic virial theorem implies that @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the normalized amplitude of the three - point correlation function . 
 the value of @xmath113 for dark matter clustering is somewhat uncertain , but may be close to @xmath114 in lcdm ( suto 1993 ) , and thus this estimate is fairly consistent with our prediction presented here . 
 .power - law fits to the relative peculiar velocity dispersion in the lcdm model . 
 [ tab : power - law - fit ] [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ "" , ]      it is well known that the pvd of the observed galaxies is generally smaller than the value predicted in current popular models ( e.g. , davis & peebles 1983 ; mo , jing & brner 1993 ; suto 1993 ; suto & jing 1997 ) . 
 this may be interpreted as a manifestation of the spatial biasing of galaxies relative to dark matter . 
 jing , mo & brner ( 1998 ) analyzed the las campanas redshift survey galaxies and developed a phenomenological biasing model , cluster underweight bias ( clw , hereafter ) which successfully accounts for the amplitudes of the two - point correlation function and the pvd simultaneously . 
 more recently jing , brner & suto ( 2002 ) performed the similar analysis of galaxies in the pscz catalog ( saunders et al . 
 2000 ) which are selected from the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) point source catalog ( psc ; beichman et al . 
 they found that the iras selected galaxies , which are likely to be dominated by late - types , have significantly smaller pvd than those in other catalogues . 
 in addition , they applied the clw bias scheme to mock samples from @xmath5-body simulations and concluded that the pvd of the pscz galaxies is significantly smaller than those predicted from the clw bias in the popular cdm models . in this subsection 
 , we revisit this issue combing the biasing effect with our analytical model of the pvd in a complementary manner to the direct method using the @xmath5-body data . 
 the clw scheme can be applied to our analytical model easily . according to jing et al . 
 ( 2002 ) , we adopt that the selection function of galaxies in a halo of mass @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath115 . 
 this is simply equivalent to replacing the mass function @xmath7 in equation ( [ eq : pvdf ] ) by @xmath116 . because this biasing model puts lower weight on the massive clusters where the velocity dispersion is large 
 , increasing @xmath117 suppresses the mean pvd . 
 in fact , the las campanas redshift survey data are consistent with @xmath118 , and the pscz data prefer a much larger value @xmath119 . physically speaking 
 , this phenomenological prescription should be understood as the dependence of the efficiency of galaxy formation on the mass of the hosting halo . 
 in addition we consider another biasing to take into account the observed density - morphology relation of galaxies . 
 since spiral galaxies preferentially avoid the central region of massive clusters ( i.e. , halos in the present context ) , the pvd of spirals is generally suppressed especially in the case of the modified nfw profile that has stronger central concentration ( c.f . 
 , fig.[fig : svd ] ) . 
 we attempt to incorporate this effect by introducing the selection probability that depends on a distance from the center of the halo : @xmath120 we set @xmath121 and @xmath122 so as to reproduce the observed ratio of spirals to ellipticals ; 2:8 in the inner part and 8:2 in the outer part . in practice 
 , we calculate the pvd by replacing @xmath12 by @xmath123 in equation ( [ eq : ndisp ] ) . 
 the results are shown in figure [ fig : bias ] for the modified nfw profile in the lcdm model . 
 the dotted and short - dashed lines represent the results taking account of the clw bias effect while the long - dashed lines consider the density  morphology relation ( eq.[[eq : dmr ] ] ) in addition to the clw bias . 
 the degree of suppression of the pvd is in agreement with the simulation results of jing et al . 
 even with the density  morphology relation , the pvd of the iras pscz galaxies is too small to be reconciled in the current model as jing et al . 
 ( 2002 ) claimed . 
 we have presented a detailed prediction for the pairwise peculiar velocity distribution function ( pvdf ) applying the dark matter halo approach . in particular , we have derived the pvdf in a direct and self - consistent manner with the assumed density profile for dark matter halo for the first time . 
 on the other hand , we neglect the halo - halo contribution assuming that any pair of particles resides in a common halo . 
 thus our predictions are quantitatively valid only on small scales @xmath124mpc , but our result turns out to be fairly close to the previous one by sheth ( 1996 ) and sheth et al . 
 ( 2001 ) who assumed the _ 
 isothermal _ velocity distribution in a single halo . in this sense 
 , our independent approach may be regarded as to provide an empirical justification for their simplifying assumptions , and also our predictions are fairly accurate on those small scales . 
 we have shown that the shape of the pvdf is well approximated by the exponential in a fairly insensitive manner to either the cosmological model or the dark halo density profile . 
 the dependence on the pvd on the halo density profiles that we employed is also fairly small , yielding the difference less than about 10 percent . 
 we have also obtained a practical fitting formula for the pvd of dark matter particles ( eq.[[eq : sigmafit ] ] ) at different cosmological models as a function of the pair separation . 
 this may be useful in modeling redshift - space distortion of clustering . 
 the result is in reasonable agreement with the estimate on the basis of the cosmic virial theorem . 
 furthermore we apply an empirical biasing scheme into our model and attempt to predict the pvd of _ galaxies_. we can reproduce the previous simulation results on the basis of our analytical method , and also confirmed that the very small pvd estimated for the pscz galaxies ( jing et al . 
 2002 ) is difficult to be reconciled with a simplistic biasing model and/or the underlying cdm model . 
 the discrepancy between the prediction and the observation shown in section [ sec : bias ] indicates the presence of velocity bias , in addition to the other selection effects . 
 in fact , each luminous galaxy is a clump composed of the baryon as well as dark matter particles , whose bulk motion might not trace the random motion of the individual dark matter particles . in this case , the galaxy - galaxy interaction through tidal field or gas pressure of baryon might be an important source for velocity bias . 
 at least , our present treatment using dark matter halo approach can provide a quantitative prediction for the pvd of the dark matter particles . 
 therefore next step , the effect of velocity bias including these interactions should be incorporated into our scheme to account for the pvd of the galaxies .","we derive the pairwise peculiar velocity distribution function of dark matter particles applying the dark matter halo approach . unlike the previous work

70,"in the early days of general relativity there was a common belief that the universe had to be eternal and unchanging . following this concept , 
 albert einstein introduced the first cosmological model , subsequently named after him . 
 it consisted of a compact spatial hypersurface with positive curvature , the @xmath0-sphere @xmath1 , which did not change under the flow of time . in order to overcome the attraction force of matter and 
 obtain a static configuration , a new term had to be introduced in the field equations  the famous cosmological constant . 
 although numerous observations have since excluded this kind of static models in favor of expanding ones , the einstein universe is still a very important explicit solution of the einstein equations , partly because of the conformal equivalence between ( a region of ) this model and minkowski s spacetime ( the standard background for quantum field theories ) . 
 for example , since maxwell s equations are conformally invariant , one can think of any configuration of electromagnetic fields in the einstein universe as a configuration in flat spacetime . 
 + the einstein universe is a particular case of , and conformal to , the closed friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models , where the assumption of staticity is relaxed by introducing a scale factor that allows the universe to expand or contract . using this relation 
 , one can extend solutions of maxwell s equations in the einstein universe to the closed flrw models . 
 in general , when one allows the spatial volume to change in time , the energy of the electromagnetic configuration will also change according to an appropriate power of the scale factor . 
 + the common denominator of the models described above is the @xmath0-sphere @xmath1 . 
 this manifold is an important example of a non - trivial fibre bundle , given by the hopf fibration , whose base is the usual @xmath2-sphere @xmath3 , and whose fibres are circles @xmath4 ( the clifford parallels ) . 
 it is natural to look for solutions of the maxwell equations whose electric and magnetic fields , as measured by the static observers , are aligned with these fibres . 
 such ansatz will be used in the first section to find a remarkable solution of maxwell s equations in the einstein universe , which will then be interpreted as a knotted , finite energy , radiating electromagnetic field in minkowski s spacetime . 
 the extension of this solution to closed flrw models will be carried out in the second section . 
 finally , the matter distribution that must be added to obtain a self - consistent solution of the einstein - maxwell equations will be determined in the third section . 
 + we follow the conventions of @xcite ; in particular , we use the einstein summation convention and a system of units in which @xmath5 . 
 we are interested in finding solutions of the maxwell equations in the cylinder @xmath6 with the standard lorentzian metric . 
 this manifold represents a static universe with positive cosmological constant @xmath7 , called the einstein universe . by choosing the radius of this universe as our unit length we can assume , without any loss of generality , that @xmath8 is the product of @xmath9 by the unit sphere . 
 + since @xmath10 is a lie group , so is @xmath8 . we can introduce the following left - invariant orthonormal tetrad of one - forms on this manifold : take @xmath11 to be the standard element of the holonomic basis on the cylinder , defining the cross section foliation . on each leaf ,

 @xmath13 thus reproducing the @xmath14 lie algebra structure . in terms of the dual orthonormal vector tetrad , the choice of @xmath15 and relation ( [ eq : mcr ] ) 
 can be written as @xmath16 = 2 \varepsilon_{ijk } x_k.\ ] ] we look for a solution of the maxwell equations in vacuum , @xmath17 with the faraday two - form @xmath18 written in this basis , they are @xmath19 the simplest nontrivial solution can be obtained from the assumption that the components @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the electric and magnetic fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 measured by the stationary observers depend only on time . using that ansatz 
 , we arrive at the relations @xmath24 a solution of system ( [ eq : maxtime ] ) will include trigonometric functions with different initial phases and field strength factors . 
 we choose the simplest one for the conformal analysis , @xmath25 because the results will not change qualitatively under more general assumptions . 
 + recall that minkowski s spacetime is conformal to an open region of the einstein universe @xcite . 
 more precisely , the minkowski metric @xmath26 can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the standard hyperspherical coordinates on the 3-sphere . in these coordinates , 
 minkowski s spacetime corresponds to the region @xmath29 ( fig . 
 [ fig : figure3 ] ) . 
 since maxwell s equations are conformally invariant , we can interpret as an electromagnetic field in flat spacetime . 
 the energy will of course change under the conformal transformation . 
 its value will be given by the integral expression @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the energy - momentum tensor of @xmath32 , @xmath33 is @xmath34 normalized by the minkowski metric @xmath26 , and @xmath35 is the spacelike hypersurface corresponding to the hyperspherical cap @xmath36 of constant @xmath37 ( fig . 
 [ fig : figure3 ] ) . 
 note that @xmath35 is not a cauchy surface for minkowski s spacetime unless @xmath38 , as it approaches @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 .    using @xmath43 and @xmath44 
 , we can reexpress the energy as an integral over the hyperspherical cap @xmath36 , @xmath45 it is straightforward to see that this quantity is finite . 
 moreover , it is a decreasing function of the parameter @xmath42 , which indicates that the solution under consideration describes radiation fields . 
 this can be seen by looking at the time dependence of the energy ( fig . 
 [ fig : figure1 ] . ) , given , for @xmath42 , by the formula @xmath46         + the electromagnetic field is related to the simplest initial conditions given by raada in ( * ? ? ? 
 * section 2 ) ( see also @xcite ) , where only the initial magnetic field is nonzero . 
 in fact , the phase - shifted solution ( with @xmath47 ) @xmath48 is the cauchy development of initial conditions of that type . due to the fact that it is aligned along the clifford parallels , 
 the hopf index @xmath49 is equal to one in our case . 
 this fact can be confirmed using an integral expression for this quantity , namely @xmath50 where @xmath51 . 
 in this section we turn our attention to the expanding models . consider a metric of the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the standard metric of @xmath1 with unit radius ; this corresponds to a closed flrw model , widely used in modern cosmology @xcite . 
 + in analogy with the previous case , we introduce the tetrad @xmath54 , @xmath55 and the dual vector basis @xmath56 . 
 + we are looking for a solution of the maxwell equations similar to , namely with a faraday tensor of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 depend only on time . substituting into the vacuum maxwell equations , , we have @xmath60 yielding @xmath61 the einstein universe case corresponds to @xmath62 . 
 note that the @xmath63 component of the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor is @xmath64 indicating that the energy density of the solution is decaying with the fourth power of the radius of the universe . 
 the solutions of maxwell s equations discussed in the last sections were derived under the assumption of a fixed background metric , satisfying the einstein field equations @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the einstein tensor , @xmath67 is the metric and @xmath68 is the total stress - energy tensor . 
 one can ask what kind of matter has to be present for this configuration to be self - consistent . in order to answer this question , we consider the decomposition of the full stress - energy tensor into the parts coming from the electromagnetic field and matter , @xmath69 we already used the expression for the time - time component of @xmath70 when computing the energy of the solution ( [ eq : maxsol ] ) ; the full expression for this tensor is given by ( [ eq : setef ] ) . 
 it is straightforward to see that it has diagonal form for any solution of the system ( [ eq : maxsoltime ] ) , @xmath71 , where in general @xmath72 . 
 let us start from the assumption that matter can be described by a density @xmath73 and a principal pressure @xmath74 aligned with @xmath75 , @xmath76 a possible interpretation of this anisotropic pressure can be given by superimposing the stress - energy tensors of two pressureless fluids with the same mass density @xmath77 , moving in opposite directions along @xmath75 , with the same velocity with respect to the fundamental observers : @xmath78 another possible interpretation can be given by considering cosmic strings aligned with the clifford parallels , expanding and contracting with space while preserving the structure of the hopf fibration . 
 because the metric in this model is similar to that of the closed flrw universe , we end up with a system analogous to the friedmann equations with the additional terms from electromagnetic stress - energy tensor , @xmath79 as it turns out , we can deal with system ( [ eq : freq ] ) using a similar procedure as in the standard case @xcite . 
 the first equation is equivalent to @xmath80 after taking a time derivative of both sides and using the third equation from ( [ eq : freq ] ) , we find @xmath81 where @xmath82 is another integration constant . 
 we can use now the second equation from ( [ eq : freq ] ) to obtain the pressure @xmath74 as @xmath83 note that the matter satisfies the weak , strong and dominant energy conditions if @xmath84 , as in this case @xmath85 . 
 nevertheless , @xmath86 always approaches @xmath87 as @xmath88 tends to zero , indicating that the matter particles approach the speed of light near the big bang or the big crunch . in the limit case 
 @xmath89 we have @xmath90 , meaning that the particles are actually moving at the speed of light . 
 + the behavior of the scale factor @xmath88 can be derived from an effective potential formulation . using ( [ eq : fried1 ] ) and ( [ eq : friedrho ] ) 
 we have @xmath91 we can think about each term as a kinetic part , an effective potential @xmath92 , and a conserved energy @xmath93 , respectively , @xmath94 the potential is a function of @xmath88 , but also depends on the three parameters @xmath7 , @xmath82 and @xmath95 . 
 clearly we need a positive cosmological constant to have an ( unstable ) equilibrium point , so that we can reproduce the previous results concerning the einstein universe . in this case 
 , @xmath92 will have the shape depicted on fig . 
 [ fig : figure2 ] . depending on the values of the parameters 
 , we can have expanding solutions , recollapsing solutions , de sitter - like bouncing solutions , and of course the unstable static solution and its asymptotes . 
 note that in units for which the radius of the static solution is @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 ( hence we must have @xmath98 ) .        finally , we note that except in the case of the einstein universe and its two asymptotes , the electromagnetic field performs a finite number @xmath49 of oscillations during the history of the universe , proportional to its lifetime as measured in conformal time : @xmath99 therefore , at any given epoch these fields will appear mostly constant and may perhaps serve as models of primordial magnetic fields @xcite .      c.  misner , k.  thorne and j.  wheeler , _ gravitation _ , freeman , 1973 .

71,"shape memory alloys [ sma ] are materials having many applications and attracting a lot of interest due to their unique properties of shape memory and pseudoelasticity , which stem from both temperature - induced and stress - induced martensitic phase transition . 
 the mechanical behaviour of such materials is rather complex and arises from a strong interaction between thermal and mechanical phenomena . 
 in fact , when these materials undergo the martensitic phase transition , the increase in temperature due to localised self - heating / self - cooling has been experimentally found to be anything but negligible @xcite . hence , the effects of heat transfer and of the heat dissipation towards the ambient are of primary relevance in the study of these materials @xcite and play a role in the rate - dependent behaviour of sma @xcite .    in modelling the mechanical behaviour of a sma 
 it is therefore important to account for mechanical and thermal aspects at the same time and to evaluate all the phenomena in their time evolution .    in literature there 
 exist many constitutive models for sma @xcite , which are derived following different approaches . 
 some authors propose models developed within plasticity frameworks , which make use of one or even more internal variables to describe the pseudo - elastic behaviour @xcite . 
 another group of constitutive models has been developed within a thermomechanic context ; in his work , tanaka @xcite proposed a macroscale model comprising an internal variable to quantify the extent of the phase transition , a dissipation potential and an assumed transformation kinetic . 
 similarly , other models based on the same thermodynamic background but featuring different kinetic laws have been formulated @xcite , and a complete heat equation which accounts for the contribution of latent heat and of the dissipation connected with the phase transition was added to the framework @xcite . among others , 
 chang et al . 
 @xcite proposed a model comprising a strain - gradient elastic free energy and a chemical ( transitional ) free energy ; abeyaratne et al . 
 @xcite developed a model including a non - convex helmholtz free energy function of the strain in order to describe the regions of stability of the different phases . in the context of using a non - convex free energy , it is not uncommon that micro - mechanical models are proposed @xcite ; muller and seelecke @xcite developed a microscale model based on statistical physics comprising a bulk free energy function of the lattice shear deformation . 
 another approach to the description of the behaviour of sma consists in applying the ginzburg - landau theory for phase transitions . at a microscopic scale , 
 falk @xcite developed a landau theory based on a shear strain order parameter . 
 levitas and preston @xcite proposed a single - grain model based on the decomposition of the strain in an elastic and a transformational part , the latter being described by a pure order parameter which can assume different values to identify the different phases . in a similar fashion , wang and khachaturyan @xcite proposed a model in which the strain field depends on several order parameters , whose evolution is described by several time - dependent ginzburg - landau [ tdgl ] equations . 
 nevertheless , attempts to handle the problem at a larger scale of observation have been made as well . among others , 
 ahluwalia et al . 
 @xcite and chen and yang @xcite proposed meso - scale models for the description of polycrystalline materials in which the order parameters account for the different orientations of each single grain ; in the same spirit , brocca et al . 
 @xcite proposed a microplane model attempting to bridge the gap between micromechanics - based and macroscale models . 
 berti et al . 
 @xcite proposed a ginzburg - landau model which can be applied at the macroscale and encompasses mechanical as well as thermal effects by introducing the balance of linear momentum equation and the heat equation in a thermodynamically consistent framework ; the order parameter is related to the extent of the phase transition between austenite and the martensite variants and its evolution is regulated by a tdgl equation . 
 owing to the presence of the heat equation , it is possible to describe the thermo - mechanical interactions which strongly influence the constitutive behaviour of a sma and to account for non - isothermal conditions . 
 the model is presented both in a three - dimensional and a monodimensional setting ; the reduction to this latter case is still meaningful because in most engineering applications sma wires are employed .    in this paper 
 , we present a numerical study on the thermomechanical behaviour of a sma , with a particular focus on the rate - dependent response and on the influence of thermal conduction and heat transfer in the mechanical behaviour . 
 starting from the models proposed in berti et al . 
 @xcite and daghia et al . 
 @xcite , we formulate a new free energy functional and give a proper expression for the relaxation parameter regulating the tdgl equation ; this gives the model the properties required to reproduce the symmetrical behaviour between the austenite - to - martensite and the martensite - to - austenite phase transitions observed experimentally . 
 the ability of the model to quantitatively reproduce a variety of experimental evidences of a typical polycrystalline niti alloy is then demonstrated . 
 the paper is organised as follows . in section [ 
 sect : model ] , the theoretical model is described , starting from a suitable ginzburg - landau free energy whose properties are outlined in section [ sect : gl - pot ] . 
 constitutive relations are given in section [ sect : constit ] , while the thermodynamic consistency of the model is shown in section [ sect : consistency ] and the complete differential system with appropriate boundary and initial conditions is provided in section [ sect : equations ] . in section [ 
 sect : galerkin ] the galerkin formulation of the differential problem , suitable for the finite element implementation , is sketched . 
 section [ sect : num - tests ] is the main part of the paper , where the numerical results of a number of simulated tensile tests on a bar specimen under different conditions are reported . after describing , in section [ sect : baseline ] , 
 the effectiveness of the model in recovering the main experimental evidences in terms of stress - strain response , phase morphology and temperature evolution , in section [ sect : temp - test ] tensile tests performed at different values of the initial temperature are illustrated , while in section [ sect : max - def ] the stress - strain response under partial - loading conditions is depicted . 
 the rate - dependent behaviour of the model is investigated in section [ sect : strain - rate ] , with a particular focus on the effects of the strain - rate on the domain nucleation , the hysteresis cycle and the energy dissipation . 
 the influence of heat transfer phenomena on the mechanical response of the specimen is examined in section [ sect : environment ] . 
 the last two aspects are considered jointly in section [ sect : env - rate ] . 
 the paper ends drawing some conclusions in section [ sect : concl ] . 
 the thermomechanical properties of sma stem from the nature of the martensitic phase transition ; here we will account for it by means of a ginzburg - landau approach @xcite . to this end 
 we have to define a phase field , or order parameter , @xmath0 ; differently from the approach followed , among others , by falk @xcite , the order parameter is not identified with the uniaxial strain @xmath1 , but rather the phase field @xmath0 is used here as a macroscopic indicator of the phase ( martensite or austenite ) of the material at every point @xcite . 
 strain is an independent field , though it is coupled with the order parameter . 
 we assume that the martensite phase be present in only two relevant variants , @xmath2 , characterised by opposite uniaxial transformation strains with respect to the austenite phase [ a ] , namely @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a fixed direction . 
 the ginzburg - landau potential , whose properties will be described in detail in section [ sect : gl - pot ] , is expressly formulated to have ( at most ) three stable values of @xmath0 at values @xmath5 , corresponding to phases @xmath6 , respectively . 
 we remark that , as a consequence of the _ first order _ character of the martensitic phase transition , intermediate values of @xmath0 do not represent any physically stable phase , but only transition layers between different stable or metastable physical phases . 
 the model has to encompass evolution equations for the three basic fields : the order parameter ( @xmath0 ) , the strain ( @xmath7 ) and the temperature ( @xmath8 ) . 
 the evolution of the phase field will be described by the tdgl equation @xmath9 the strain will be determined through the combination of the balance of linear momentum equation and a proper constitutive relation between strain , stress and order parameter , while the heat equation regulating the temperature evolution will arise from the balance of energy equation .    for the formulation of the model 
 , we consider a bar sample of sma occupying a bidimensional material domain @xmath10 . 
 we indicate with @xmath11 the material coordinates and with @xmath12 the displacement vector field . 
 relying on the small displacement approximation , we use the linearised strain tensor @xmath13 $ ] . 
 following berti et al . 
 @xcite , we assume a ginzburg - landau free energy in the form @xmath14},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the temperature function @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 being @xmath17 the specific heat , @xmath18 a reference temperature for the specific heat , @xmath19 the compliance modulus , @xmath20 the stress tensor , @xmath21 the interface energy parameter regulating the interface width , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 material parameters related to the phase transition whose physical meaning will be explained in the following . 
 the two potentials @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined by @xmath28 } + \frac{1}{8 } { \left [ { 1 - \cos { \left ( { 2 \pi { \varphi } } \right ) } } \right]},\\    g({\varphi } ) & = & 1 - \cos { \left ( { \pi { \varphi } } \right)}.\end{aligned}\ ] ]    [ cols=""^,^ "" , ]     the stress - strain diagrams referring to the tests performed at different strain rates for the values of the heat transfer coefficient @xmath29 and @xmath30 are reported in figs . 
 [ fig : stress - strain - rate - h5 ] and [ fig : stress - strain - rate - h20 ] , respectively , together with the maximum number of martensite nuclei originated during the loading stage . 
 the behaviour is the same described in section [ sect : strain - rate ] for the case @xmath31 . 
 a ginzburg - landau model that reproduces the most relevant macroscopic features of the behaviour of a shape memory alloy has been considered . 
 the model encompasses a time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation for the evolution of the phase order parameter , the balance of linear momentum and the heat equation , in order to account for the interplay between the transitional , mechanical and thermal aspects which strongly influences the behaviour of sma . starting from the theoretical model described in berti et al . 
 @xcite , a new free energy based on trigonometric functions has been formulated and a suitable form of the relaxation parameter of the tdgl equation has been proposed . 
 the resulting properties of the model ensure the driving force for the phase transition from austenite to martensite to be equal to the driving force for the transition from martensite to austenite and , consequently , provide a symmetrical behaviour of the model upon loading and unloading . 
 numerical simulations have been performed to investigate the mechanical response of the model ; tensile tests on a bar specimen have been simulated under different conditions by changing the initial temperature , the maximum imposed strain , the nominal imposed strain - rate and the environmental conditions . 
 the results obtained illustrate that the model is able to reproduce the main experimental evidences reported in literature @xcite . 
 the simulated tensile tests show the presence of a stress drop during the phase nucleation , which may be absent in the unloading stage if the loading is interrupted before the completion of the phase transition ; temperature profiles consistent with the observed physical phenomena have also been described . 
 the effect of the strain - rate on the mechanical response of the model have been investigated ; its impact on the number of nucleating domains , the nucleation stress , the stress relaxation during nucleation and on the slope of the stress plateau ( strain - hardening ) have been recovered . 
 the role of the environmental conditions in the mechanical response have also been examined , and the concurrent influence of heat transfer conditions and strain - rate on the damping capacity and on the overall behaviour of the model have been described .

72,"we study surfaces in space @xmath0 such that through each point of the surface one can draw two circles fully contained in the surface . hereafter by a _ 
 circle _ we mean either an ordinary circle in @xmath0 or a straight line . in this paper 
 we reduce finding all such surfaces to the algebraic problem of finding all pythagorean @xmath1-tuples of polynomials . in a subsequent publication we are going to solve the latter problem . 
 the problem of finding such surfaces traces back to the works of darboux from xixth century . 
 basic examples  a one - sheeted hyperboloid and a nonrotational ellipsoid  are discussed in hilbert  cohn - vossen s `` anschauliche geometrie '' . there 
 ( and respectively , in a recent paper @xcite by nilov and the first author ) it is also proved that a smooth surface containing two lines ( respectively , a line and a circle ) through each point is a quadric or a plane . 
 a torus contains @xmath2 circles through each point : a meridian , a parallel , and two villarceau circles .    [ 
 cols=""^ "" , ]     all these examples are particular cases of a _ darboux cyclide _ , i.e. , a subset of @xmath0 given by the equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 $ ] of degree @xmath6 do not vanish simultaneously ; see figure  [ movie ] to the left . 
 equivalently , a _ 
 darboux cyclide _ is the stereographic projection of the intersection of the sphere @xmath7 with another @xmath8-dimensional quadric ( * ? ? ? 
 * section  2.2 ) . 
 almost each darboux cyclide contains at least @xmath9 circles through each point ( and there is an effective algorithm to count their actual number @xcite ) . 
 conversely , darboux has shown that @xmath10 circles through each point guarantee that an analytic surface is a darboux cyclide . 
 this result has been improved over the years : in fact already @xmath8 , or @xmath9 orthogonal , or @xmath9 cospheric circles are sufficient for the same conclusion ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem  3 ) , ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem  1 ) , ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem  20 in p.  296 ) , cf . 
 hereafter two circles are called _ cospheric _ , if they are contained in one @xmath9-dimensional sphere or plane . 
 recently there has been a renewed interest to surfaces containing @xmath9 circles through each point due to pottmann who considered their potential applications to architecture @xcite . 
 pottmann noticed that the _ euclidean translational surface _ 
 @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are two fixed generic circles in @xmath0 , contains @xmath9 circles through each point but is not a darboux cyclide ( * ? ? ? 
 * example  3.9 ) . 
 another example with similar properties was given by zub in 2011 : the stereographic projection of a _ 
 clifford translational surface _ 
 @xmath13 , where @xmath12 are now circles in the sphere @xmath14 identified with the set of unit quaternions . 
 the projection itself is called a _ 
 clifford translational surface _ as well ; see figure  [ movie ] to the right . 
 it may have degree up to @xmath15 . 
 each degree @xmath15 surface in @xmath7 containing a _ great _ circle and another circle through each point is clifford translational ( * ? ? ? * corollary  2c ) . 
 more examples can be obtained from these translational surfaces by _ mbius transformations _ 
 , i.e. , compositions of inversions . 
 euclidean and clifford translational surfaces are not mbius transformations of each other ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem 2b ) . for related transformations taking lines to circles 
 see @xcite . 
 we conjecture that the above ones are the only possible surfaces containing @xmath9 circles through each point . 
 let us make this statement precise . 
 we switch to a local problem involving a piece of a surface instead of a closed one and circular arcs instead of circles . by an _ analytic surface _ in @xmath16 we mean the image of an injective real analytic map of a planar domain into @xmath16 with nondegenerate differential at each point . 
 we use the same notation for the map and the surface ; no confusion arises from this . a circle ( or circular arc ) 
 _ analytically depending _ on a point is a real analytic map of an analytic surface into the variety of all circles ( or circular arcs ) in @xmath16 . 
 analyticity is not really a restriction @xcite . 
 [ mainthm ] if through each point of an analytic surface in @xmath0 one can draw two transversal circular arcs fully contained in the surface ( and analytically depending on the point ) then the surface is a mbius transformation of a subset of either a darboux cyclide , or euclidean or clifford translational surface . 
 we hope to deduce main conjecture  [ mainthm ] from the following 4-dimensional counterpart . 
 the @xmath2-dimensional problem seems to be more accessible than the @xmath8-dimensional one because of nice approach using quaternions . in what follows 
 identify @xmath17 with the skew field @xmath18 of quaternions , and @xmath0 with the set @xmath19 of purely imaginary quaternions . 
 mbius transformations in @xmath17 are precisely the nondegenerate maps of the form @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ; see  @xcite for an exposition . 
 circles in @xmath17 are precisely the nondegenerate curves having a parametrization of the form @xmath23 ( outside one point ) , where @xmath22 are fixed and @xmath24 runs . 
 denote by @xmath25 $ ] the set of polynomials with quaternionic coefficients of degree at most @xmath26 in the variable @xmath27 and at most @xmath28 in the variable @xmath29 ( the variables commute with each other and the coefficients ) . 
 denote @xmath30 . 
 define @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 analogously . 
 for each @xmath34 and real numbers @xmath35 ( but not quaternions ) the value @xmath36 is well - defined . 
 thus the polynomial @xmath37 or a rational expression in such polynomials defines a surface in @xmath17 . 
 [ 4dbconj ] assume that through each point of an analytic surface in @xmath17 one can draw two noncospheric circular arcs fully contained in the surface ( and analytically depending on the point ) . 
 assume that for each point in some dense subset of the surface the number of circular arcs passing through the point and fully contained in the surface is finite . 
 then some mbius transformation of the surface has a parametrization @xmath38 for some polynomials @xmath39 such that @xmath40 . 
 conversely , almost each surface   contains two circular arcs @xmath41 and @xmath42 through each point because the curves @xmath23 and @xmath43 are circular arcs for almost each @xmath22 . 
 e.g. , @xmath44 is a clifford translational surface , and @xmath45 is a torus .    the first result of this paper is the following assertions reducing the @xmath8-dimensional problem to the @xmath2-dimensional one . 
 they are proved in section  [ sec : proofs ] . 
 [ prop21][prop:21-split ] if surface   is contained in @xmath0 ( respectively , in @xmath7 ) then it is a subset of either an euclidean ( respectively , clifford ) translational surface or a darboux cyclide ( respectively , an intersection of @xmath7 with another @xmath8-dimensional quadric ) . 
 [ cor-3d ] if a surface in @xmath0 is a mbius transformation of surface   in @xmath17 then the former surface is a mbius transformation of a subset of either a darboux cyclide , or euclidean or clifford translational surface . 
 surfaces containing two circles through each point are particular cases of surfaces containing two conic sections or lines through each point . 
 the latter surfaces have been classified by brauner , schicho , and lubbes @xcite . in the particular case of so - called supercyclides 
 a classification was given by degen @xcite . 
 the schicho classification is up to a week equivalence relation , thus it does not allow automatically to find all surfaces containing two circles through each point . 
 however the following parametrization result by schicho provides the first step toward the solution of our problem . 
 the notions used in the statement are defined analogously to the above ; see section  [ sec : proofs2 ] for details . 
 [ schicho ] assume that through each point of an analytic surface in a domain in @xmath28-dimensional complex projective space one can draw two transversal conic sections intersecting each other only at this point ( and analytically depending on the point ) such that their intersections with the domain are contained in the surface . 
 assume that through each point in some dense subset of the surface one can draw only finitely many conic sections such that their intersections with the domain are contained in the surface . 
 then the surface ( possibly besides a one - dimensional subset ) has a parametrization @xmath46 for some @xmath47 such that the conic sections are the curves @xmath41 and @xmath42 . 
 conversely , one can see immediately that almost each surface   contains two conic sections @xmath41 and @xmath42 through each point . 
 theorem  [ schicho ] in particular implies that each surface containing two conic sections through each point is contained in an projective subspace of dimension at most @xmath15 and has the degree at most @xmath15 ( by standard elimination of variables ) . 
 theorem  [ schicho ] is proved completely analogously to ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem  11 ) , where the case when @xmath48 is considered ; see also ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem  17 ) . for convenience of the reader 
 we give the proof in section  [ sec : proofs2 ] . in comparison 
 to @xcite we have added some details to make it accessible to nonspecialists . 
 the main result of the paper is the following corollary also proved in section  [ sec : proofs2 ] . 
 [ haupt][param ] assume that through each point of an analytic surface in @xmath49 ( respectively , in @xmath16 ) one can draw two noncospheric circular arcs fully contained in the surface ( and analytically depending on the point ) . 
 assume that through each point in some dense subset of the surface one can draw only finitely many circular arcs fully contained in the surface . 
 then the surface ( possibly besides a one - dimensional subset ) has a parametrization @xmath50 where @xmath51 satisfy the equation @xmath52 ( respectively , the equation @xmath53 for some @xmath54 ) . 
 this result reduces the above conjectures to solving the equation @xmath55 for `` pythagorean @xmath28-tuples '' in real polynomials . 
 the resulting problem is hard but seems more accessible because of possible induction over the involved parameters ( @xmath28 , number of variables , degree ) . 
 the problem has been solved for @xmath48 and @xmath2 in ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem  2.2 ) using that @xmath56 $ ] is a unique factorization domain ( ufd ) . in case of one variable a similar argument works for @xmath57 and @xmath1 because @xmath58 $ ] is still a ufd in a sense ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem  1 in chapter  2 ) , cf . 
 @xcite , @xcite and conjecture  [ conj-1-var ] below . 
 the main difficulty of passing to two variables is that @xmath59 $ ] is _ not _ a ufd any more ; see example  [ ex - beauregard ] below taken from  @xcite . 
 the case of two variables and @xmath60 arising in our geometric problem seems to be the simplest case not accessible by the methods available before . 
 so far we give only one result in this direction , which is nice and interesting in itself , useful for the proof of the above conjectures and also for theorem  [ prop21 ] above . 
 the result is proved in section  [ sec : final ] . 
 [ l - splitting - basic ] 
 if @xmath61 for some @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 of degree  @xmath9 then @xmath65 is reducible . 
 [ cor - splitting ] if @xmath66 for some @xmath67 , @xmath68 such that @xmath69 and @xmath70 have degree @xmath9 then for some @xmath71 and @xmath72 we have @xmath73    to summarize , the results of this paper reduce main conjecture  [ mainthm ] to the following completely algebraic conjecture . by a _ mbius transformation _ of @xmath74 
 we mean a linear transformation @xmath75 which preserves the homogeneous equation @xmath76 of @xmath74 
 .    [ conj - alg ] polynomials @xmath77 satisfy equation @xmath66 if and only if up to mbius transformation of @xmath74 not depending on @xmath78 we have @xmath79 for some @xmath39 , @xmath80 such that @xmath81 . 
 the parametrizations of conjectures  [ conj - alg ] and  [ 4dbconj ] are related to each other via the stereographic projection @xmath82 . 
 we plan to prove all the above conjectures in a subsequent publication . 
 this is reasonable because the remaining algebraic part of the conjectures is proved by very different methods . 
 in this section we prove the results on the classification of surfaces parametrized by quaternionic rational functions of small degree up to mbius transformation : theorem  [ prop21 ] and corollary  [ cor-3d ] . 
 let us prove several lemmas required for the proof of theorem  [ prop21 ] . 
 these lemmas are independent in the sense that the proof of each one uses the statements but not the proofs of the other ones .    in what follows @xmath83 are arbitrary polynomials not vanishing identically . 
 linear homogeneous polynomials @xmath84 $ ] are defined by the formulae @xmath85 and @xmath86 . by a _ 
 possibly degenerate surface _ we mean an analytic map of a planar domain into @xmath16 not necessarily with nondegenerate differential , and also the image of the map , if no confusion arises . 
 a _ possibly degenerate hypersurface _ is defined analogously . 
 first we consider the ( possibly degenerate ) surface @xmath87 being a particular case of surface  . 
 we are going to estimate its degree . 
 for that we estimate the degree of the ( possibly degenerate ) hypersurface @xmath88 it has the rational parametrization @xmath89 of degree at most @xmath9 in each variable , and by elimination of variables ( not used in the paper ) it has degree at most @xmath15 . 
 we prove a much sharper estimate . 
 [ l-3folddeg4 ] the ( possibly degenerate ) hypersurface @xmath90 is contained in an algebraic hypersurface of degree at most @xmath2 .    if a point @xmath91 is contained in the hypersurface @xmath90 then @xmath92 for some @xmath93 not vanishing simultaneously . 
 the latter quaternionic equation can be considered as a system of @xmath2 real linear homogeneous equations in the variables @xmath94 with the coefficients linearly depending on the parameters @xmath95 . 
 the system has a nonzero solution if and only if the determinant of the system vanishes , which gives an algebraic equation in @xmath95 of degree at most @xmath2 . 
 the algebraic equation defines the required algebraic hypersurface unless the determinant vanishes identically . 
 assume that the determinant vanishes identically . 
 then the system has a nonzero solution for each point @xmath96 . 
 but the set of values of the fraction @xmath90 is at most three - dimensional . 
 one can have a nonzero solution for each point in @xmath97 only if @xmath98 for some nonzero @xmath99 . 
 assume that @xmath100 without loss of generality . 
 then by the linearity @xmath101 performing a linear change of the parameters @xmath94 we may assume that both @xmath102 and @xmath103 do not depend on @xmath104 . further denote by @xmath105 and @xmath106 the resulting linear polynomials , defining the same hyperfurface @xmath90 as the initial ones . 
 then the above equation takes the form @xmath107 . 
 consider the equation as a system of @xmath2 real linear homogeneous equations in the variables @xmath108 . 
 the system has a nonzero solution if and only if all the @xmath109 minors of the system vanish , which gives four algebraic equations in @xmath95 of degree at most @xmath8 . 
 if at least one of the @xmath109 minors does not vanish identically then it defines the required algebraic surface . if all the @xmath109 minors vanish identically then repeat the argument of the previous paragraph to get linear homogeneous @xmath110 and @xmath111 depending only on @xmath9 variables 
 again , we either get the required algebraic surface or proceed to the case when @xmath112 and @xmath113 depend only on @xmath114 variable . in the latter case 
 any hyperplane passing through the point @xmath115 is the required algebraic hypersurface . 
 we consider the case when the constructed algebraic hypersurface degenerates to @xmath19 separately . 
 [ l-3fold - r3 ] assume that the ( possibly degenerate ) hypersurface @xmath90 is contained in the hyperplane @xmath19 . 
 then the map @xmath90 is a composition of a map of the form either @xmath116 or @xmath117 with a mbius transformation of @xmath19 ( with constant coefficients ) , where @xmath118 $ ] , @xmath119 $ ] , @xmath120 $ ] are linear homogeneous , and @xmath121 . 
 the inverse stereographic projection @xmath122 maps the hypersurface @xmath90 contained in @xmath123 to the hypersurface @xmath124 contained in @xmath7 . 
 thus @xmath125 identically . in particular 
 , for each @xmath126 the condition @xmath127 implies the condition @xmath128 . 
 denote @xmath129 and @xmath130 . 
 define a real linear map from the linear span of @xmath131 into the linear span of @xmath132 by the formula @xmath133 . 
 the map is well - defined because the condition @xmath134 implies @xmath135 . 
 the map is isometric because @xmath125 . 
 extend it to an isometry @xmath136 . 
 each isometry @xmath136 has one of the forms @xmath137 or @xmath138 for some @xmath139 ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem  3.2 ) . 
 therefore either @xmath140 or @xmath141 .    in the former case set @xmath142 and @xmath143 
 we have @xmath144 . 
 up to a mbius transformation this is @xmath145 , which projects stereographically to @xmath146 .    in the latter case set @xmath147 and @xmath148 . 
 we have @xmath149 . 
 up to a mbius transformation this is @xmath150 , which projects stereographically to @xmath151 . 
 [ l - quadrics ] the ( possibly degenerate ) surfaces @xmath152 and @xmath153 , where @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , are contained in certain quadrics in @xmath19 . 
 the surface @xmath158 is a subset of the sphere @xmath159 . 
 the surface @xmath153 is a rational surface in @xmath0 of degree at most @xmath114 in each variable , hence a subset of a quadric . 
 [ l - deg4 ] if the ( possibly degenerate ) surface @xmath160 is contained in @xmath19 then it is contained in an irreducible algebraic surface of degree at most @xmath2 .    by lemma  [ l-3folddeg4 ] 
 the hypersurface @xmath90 , and hence @xmath160 , is contained in an irreducible algebraic hypersurface of degree @xmath161 . 
 one of the components of the intersection of the algebraic hypersurface with the hyperplane @xmath19 is the required surface unless the algebraic hypersurface coincides with the hyperplane . in the latter case 
 the assumptions of lemma  [ l-3fold - r3 ] are satisfied . by lemmas  [ l-3fold - r3 ] and  [ l - quadrics ] the surface 
 @xmath160 is a mbius transformation of a quadric , hence has degree @xmath161 . 
 now the following folklore lemma allows us to prove a particular case of theorem  [ prop21 ] . 
 the lemma is a particular case of ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem  11 ) . 
 we give the proof for convenience of the reader . 
 [ l - cyclide ] if two irreducible algebraic surfaces of degree at most @xmath2 in @xmath0 are symmetric with respect to the unit sphere then they both are darboux cyclides 
 .    denote @xmath162 . 
 let @xmath163 and @xmath164 be equations of our surfaces of minimal degrees . since the surfaces are symmetric with respect to the unit sphere it follows that @xmath165 for some @xmath166 and @xmath167 . 
 expand @xmath168 and @xmath169 , where @xmath170 and @xmath171 are homogeneous of degree @xmath172 . 
 we get @xmath173 . 
 hence @xmath174 . 
 assume that @xmath175 ( otherwise the proof is analogous ) . 
 the degree of the left- and right - hand sides equal @xmath176 and @xmath15 respectively . 
 thus @xmath177 . comparing the highest - degree terms we get @xmath178 , hence @xmath179 is divisible by @xmath180 . comparing the degree @xmath181 terms we get @xmath182 , hence @xmath183 is divisible by @xmath184 . 
 therefore @xmath164 is a darboux cyclide . 
 analogously @xmath163 is a darboux cyclide . 
 [ prop11 ] if the surface @xmath87 , where @xmath83 , is contained in @xmath0 ( respectively , in @xmath7 ) then it is a subset of a darboux cyclide ( respectively , an intersection of @xmath7 with another @xmath8-dimensional quadric ) .    for a surface in @xmath185 
 the result follows from lemmas  [ l - deg4 ] and  [ l - cyclide ] applied to the surfaces @xmath160 and @xmath186 . 
 now consider a surface in @xmath7 . 
 project it stereographically to @xmath0 . 
 the resulting surface has the form @xmath187 . by the lemma for @xmath0 
 it is a darboux cyclide . by ( 
 * section  2.2 ) the initial surface is an intersection of @xmath7 with another quadric . 
 let us proceed to the general case of theorem  [ prop21 ] . 
 we start with a folklore lemma . 
 [ l - axial ] the curve @xmath188 , where @xmath22 , @xmath167 , @xmath189 , are fixed and @xmath24 runs , is a circle ( possibly without one point ) . if @xmath190 is contained in @xmath191 then the plane of the circle is orthogonal to the vector @xmath192 . 
 we have @xmath193 for some @xmath194 , where @xmath195 . 
 this is a composition of translations , rotations , and an inversion applied to the line @xmath196 , once @xmath167 and @xmath189 . 
 thus @xmath190 is a circle ( possibly without one point ) . 
 now assume that @xmath197 . 
 then @xmath198 . 
 since the coefficients of the polynomial in the right - hand side vanish it follows that @xmath199 and @xmath200 , hence @xmath201 is orthogonal to @xmath202 . 
 assume further that @xmath203 , otherwise @xmath190 is a line and there is nothing to prove . then the circle @xmath204 is contained in the plane spaned by @xmath201 and @xmath205 . 
 so @xmath206 is contained in a plane orthogonal to @xmath202 as well . 
 a similar result holds for the curve @xmath207 , where @xmath208 .    if @xmath209 then by lemma  [ prop11 ] @xmath210 is a subset of a darboux cyclide . 
 analogously , if @xmath211 then @xmath212 is a darboux cyclide . 
 assume further that @xmath213 . 
 since @xmath214 it follows that either @xmath215 and @xmath216 or vice versa . assume the former without loss of generality . 
 by left division of both @xmath217 and @xmath218 by the leading coefficient of @xmath217 we may achieve @xmath219 for some @xmath220 . 
 analogously , assume that @xmath221 for some @xmath222 . 
 performing an appropriate linear change of variables @xmath27 and @xmath29 we may achieve @xmath223 . 
 if @xmath224 then @xmath225 for appropriate @xmath226 , hence @xmath227 is a darboux cyclide by the previous paragraph . 
 the same holds for @xmath228 . 
 assume further that @xmath229 . 
 then we have @xmath230 for some @xmath231 because the left - hand sides vanishes identically for @xmath232 or @xmath233 . if @xmath234 then @xmath235 is a subset of a euclidean translational surface because by lemma  [ l - axial ] the curves @xmath236 and @xmath237 are circles ( not degenerating to points because @xmath227 is a nondegenerate surface ) . 
 assume further that @xmath238 . 
 by the above @xmath239 for each @xmath240 . 
 thus @xmath241 , hence @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 , and @xmath245 . 
 since @xmath246 this implies that @xmath247 . by lemma  [ l - axial ] the curves @xmath41 and @xmath42 are circles ( or points ) whose planes are orthogonal to the vector @xmath247 . 
 thus all these circles and hence the surface @xmath248 are contained in one plane .    as in the previous proof 
 , we may assume that @xmath215 , @xmath216 and @xmath213 . 
 since @xmath249 it follows that @xmath250 and @xmath251 . by splitting lemma  [ l - splitting - basic ] there exist @xmath252 and @xmath253 such that @xmath254 splits : @xmath255 or @xmath256 . since @xmath257 , without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath258 , @xmath259 .    in the case when @xmath260 we have @xmath261 is a product of two circles @xmath262 and @xmath263 in @xmath7 because @xmath258 , @xmath259 . 
 thus @xmath227 is a subset of a clifford translational surface .    in the case 
 when @xmath264 we have @xmath265 because @xmath266 . since @xmath267 it follows by lemma  [ prop11 ] that @xmath227 is contained in the intersection of @xmath7 with another @xmath8-dimensional quadric . 
 assume that a surface @xmath268 is a mbius transformation of surface  . 
 since a mbius transformation takes a hyperplane to either a hyperplane or a @xmath8-dimensional sphere it follows that the latter surface is contained either in a hyperplane or a @xmath8-dimensional sphere . 
 perform a mbius transformation @xmath269 ( a similarity ) , where @xmath270 , taking the obtained hyperplane ( respectively , the @xmath8-dimensional sphere ) to @xmath191 ( respectively , to @xmath7 ) . 
 it takes the surface @xmath271 to the surface @xmath272 again of form  . by theorem  [ prop21 ] the resulting surface either a darboux cyclide , or euclidean translational surface , or intersection of @xmath7 with another quadric , or clifford translational surface . in the latter two cases 
 perform the inversion with the center at the point @xmath273 and the radius @xmath274 projecting the surface stereographically from @xmath7 to @xmath191 . 
 this gives either a darboux cyclide ( by ( * ? ? ? 
 * section  2.2 ) ) or a clifford translational surface . in all cases 
 the resulting surface in @xmath191 is a mbius transformation of the initial surface @xmath268 . 
 we conclude the section by an open problem : find a short proof that euclidean and clifford translational surfaces are not mbius transformations of each other ; this is ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem 2b ) . 
 in this section we prove the results on parametrization of surfaces containing two conics or circles through each point : theorem  [ schicho ] and corollary  [ haupt ] . 
 the proof uses well - known methods and goes along the lines of @xcite . 
 we use the following notions . 
 let @xmath275 be the @xmath28-dimensional complex projective space with the homogeneous coordinates @xmath276 . 
 throughout we use the standard topology in @xmath275 ( not the zariski one ) . 
 a _ analytic surface _ in @xmath275 is the image of an injective complex analytic map from a domain in @xmath277 into @xmath275 with nondegenerate differential at each point . 
 an _ algebraic subset _ 
 @xmath278 is the solution set of some system of algebraic equations . 
 algebraic subsets of dimension @xmath114 and @xmath9 are called _ projective algebraic surfaces _ and _ algebraic curves _ , respectively . 
 recall that the set of all conics in @xmath275 including the ones degenerating into lines and pairs of lines is naturally identified with an algebraic subset of @xmath279 for some large @xmath280 ( depending on @xmath28 ) . 
 the latter subset is called _ the variety of all conics in @xmath275_. a conic _ analytically depending _ on a point is a complex analytic map of an analytic surface in @xmath275 into the variety of all conics in @xmath275 
 . an _ analytic family _ of conics is a complex analytic map @xmath281 of a domain in @xmath282 into the variety of all conics in @xmath275 . 
 if no confusion arises , the image of this map is also called a _ family _ of conics .    let us prove several lemmas required for the proof of theorem  [ schicho ] . 
 these lemmas are independent in the sense that the proof of each one uses the statements but not the proofs of the other ones . in what follows @xmath227 
 is a surface satisfying the assumptions of theorem  [ schicho ] unless otherwise indicated . 
 denote by @xmath283 and @xmath284 the two conics drawn through a point @xmath285 . 
 [ l - cover ] there are two analytic families of conics @xmath286 , @xmath287 , and a domain @xmath288 such that @xmath289 , each pair @xmath286 , @xmath287 intersects transversely at a unique point  @xmath290 , and @xmath291 , @xmath292 .    take a point @xmath293 . 
 draw the two conics @xmath294 and @xmath295 in the surface through the point . through each point 
 @xmath296 draw another conic @xmath297 in the surface . 
 we get an analytic family of conics @xmath287 . 
 analogously we get an analytic family of conics @xmath286 .    by the assumptions of theorem  [ schicho ] the conics @xmath298 and @xmath299 intersect transversely at a unique point . by continuity 
 there is @xmath300 such that for @xmath301 the conics @xmath286 and @xmath287 intersect transversely at a unique point @xmath290 , and @xmath302 . 
 take a sufficiently small neighborhood @xmath303 of the point @xmath304 in @xmath275 . 
 then @xmath289 . 
 it remains to show that @xmath291 and @xmath292 . 
 indeed , otherwise the image of the analytic map @xmath305 or @xmath306 in the variety of all conics in @xmath275 is @xmath9-dimensional 
 . then there are infinitely many conics @xmath307 through each point in an open subset of @xmath227 such that @xmath308 . 
 this contradicts to one of the assumptions of theorem  [ schicho ] . 
 thus the families @xmath286 and @xmath287 are the required . 
 [ l - algebraic ] the surface @xmath227 is contained in an irreducible algebraic surface @xmath309 . 
 the family of conics @xmath286 is contained in an irreducible algebraic curve in the variety of all conics . 
 the conics @xmath287 given by lemma  [ l - cover ] have at most @xmath2 common points because they do not all coincide . 
 thus we may assume that they do not have common points inside the domain @xmath303 ( one can restrict the surface to a smaller domain , if necessary ) . 
 then by the analyticity each point of @xmath303 belongs to at most countable number of conics @xmath287 . 
 take a sufficiently small @xmath300 such that @xmath310 for each @xmath301 . 
 consider the set @xmath311 of all conics in @xmath275 intersecting each conic @xmath287 , where @xmath312 , transversely at a unique point , which belongs to the domain @xmath303 . 
 let us show that the set @xmath311 is an open subset of an algebraic subvariety of the variety of all conics in @xmath275 . 
 indeed , the set of all conics intersecting a fixed conic @xmath287 is clearly an algebraic subvariety . 
 the set of all conics intersecting each conic @xmath287 , where @xmath312 , is the intersection of infinitely many such algebraic subvarieties , and hence also an algebraic subvariety . 
 the set @xmath311 is open in the latter subvariety because each conic sufficiently close to a conic lying in @xmath311 can only intersect a conic @xmath287 , where @xmath312 , transversely at a unique point inside the domain @xmath303 ( or not intersect at all ) . 
 let us prove that the dimension of the set @xmath311 is @xmath114 . 
 the dimension is at least @xmath114 because @xmath311 contains all the conics @xmath286 , where @xmath313 . to estimate the dimension from above , 
 take an arbitrary conic @xmath314 . 
 since each point of @xmath303 belongs to at most countable number of conics @xmath287 it follows that the conic @xmath307 has uncountably many intersection points with @xmath315 . 
 hence @xmath316 , because @xmath227 is analytic . 
 if the dimension of @xmath311 were at least @xmath9 then there would be infinitely many conics @xmath307 through each point in an open subset of @xmath227 such that @xmath308 . 
 this would contradict to one of the assumptions of theorem  [ schicho ] . 
 thus the dimension of @xmath311 is exactly @xmath114 . 
 the irreducible component of the algebraic closure of the set @xmath311 containing all the conics @xmath286 is the required algebraic curve in the variety of all conics . 
 ( since the family @xmath286 is analytic , it can not `` jump '' from one irreducible component to another . ) 
 the union of all the conics of the irreducible component ( including the ones degenerating to lines and pairs of lines ) is the required irreducible algebraic surface @xmath309 . the algebraic surface @xmath309 contains the analytic surface @xmath227 because @xmath309 contains the open subset @xmath317 of @xmath227 . 
 [ rem - infinity ] if we drop the assumption that the number of conic through certain points is finite in theorem  [ schicho ] then a similar argument shows that @xmath227 is contained in an algebraic surface @xmath318 and @xmath286 is contained in an algebraic subvariety @xmath311 of the variety of all conics in @xmath275 such that @xmath319 . 
 let @xmath320 be algebraic subsets . 
 a _ rational map _ 
 @xmath321 is a map of an open dense subset of @xmath322 into the set @xmath323 given by polynomials in homogeneous coordinates of @xmath275 . 
 ( dashes in the notation remind that a rational map may not be defined everywhere in @xmath322 . ) 
 if the restriction of a rational map @xmath324 to certain open dense subsets of @xmath322 and @xmath323 is bijective , and the inverse map is rational as well , then @xmath324 is called a _ 
 birational map_. a rational map @xmath325 is called a _ 
 rational function_. a projective algebraic surface @xmath326 is _ unirationally ruled _ ( or simply _ uniruled _ ) , if for some algebraic curve @xmath311 there is a rational map @xmath327 with dense image . 
 a surface @xmath326 is _ birationally ruled _ ( or simply _ ruled _ ) , if there is a birational map @xmath327 . 
 a curve @xmath311 is _ rational _ , if there is a birational map @xmath328 . a surface @xmath326 is _ rational _ , if there is a birational map @xmath329 . 
 [ l - uniruled ] the surface @xmath309 is unirationally ruled . 
 let @xmath330 be the irreducible curve in the variety of conics given by lemma  [ l - algebraic ] . 
 consider the algebraic set @xmath331 the second projection @xmath332 is a rational map such that a generic fiber is a conic ( and hence a rational curve ) . by the noether  enriques theorem ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem  iii.4 ) @xmath333 is birationally ruled . 
 in particular there is a rational map @xmath334 with dense image . 
 compose the map with the first projection @xmath335 , which is surjective because the surfaces @xmath333 and @xmath309 are compact and the image contains the open subset @xmath336 by lemma  [ l - cover ] . 
 we get a rational map @xmath337 with dense image , i.e. , @xmath309 is unirationally ruled . 
 the following folklore lemma is the most technical part of our proof . 
 [ l - ruled ] each unirationally ruled surface is birationally ruled . 
 let @xmath309 be a unirationally ruled surface and @xmath338 be a rational map with dense image . 
 by the hironaka theorem ( or by an earlier zariski theorem sufficient in our situation ) the surface @xmath309 has a _ desingularization _ 
 @xmath339 , i.e. , a proper birational map from a smooth projective algebraic surface @xmath340 to the surface @xmath309 . 
 let @xmath341 be the inverse rational map of the desingularization . 
 consider the rational map @xmath342 . by the theorem on eliminating indeterminacy ( 
 * theorem ii.7 ) this rational map equals to a composition @xmath343 , where @xmath344 is a smooth projective algebraic surface , the first map is birational , and the second map is rational and defined everywhere . 
 since @xmath345 has dense image and the surfaces are compact it follows that @xmath346 has dense image and @xmath347 is surjective . 
 in particular , @xmath344 is birationally ruled .    by the enriques theorem ( * ? ? ? * theorem  vi.17 and proposition  iii.21 ) , a smooth projective algebraic surface is birationally ruled if and only if for each @xmath348 the @xmath349-th tensor power of the exterior square of the cotangent bundle has no sections except identical zero ( in other terminology , _ the surface has kodaira dimension _ @xmath350 , or _ 
 all plurigeni vanish _ ) . 
 assume , to the contrary , that @xmath340 has such a section ( _ pluricanonical section _ ) . 
 then the pullback under the surjective rational map @xmath351 is such a section for the birationally ruled surface @xmath344 , a contradiction . 
 thus @xmath340 , and hence @xmath309 , is birationally ruled . 
 [ l - rational ] the surface @xmath309 is rational .    by lemmas  [ l - uniruled ] and 
 [ l - ruled ] the surface @xmath309 is birationally ruled . 
 thus there is a birational map @xmath352 . 
 consider the two conics through a generic point of the surface @xmath309 . 
 their images are two distinct rational curves through a point of @xmath353 . 
 since there is only one @xmath354-fiber through each point , at least one of the rational curves is nonconstantly projected to the curve @xmath311 . by the lroth theorem ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem  v.4 ) the curve @xmath311 must be rational , and hence @xmath309 is rational . 
 we conjecture that the following generalization of lemma  [ l - rational ] is true : _ an algebraic surface containing two rational curves through almost each point is rational_. see  ( * ? ? ? 
 * definition  iv.3.2 , theorems   iv.5.4 , iv.3.10.3 , corollary  iv.5.2.1 , exercise  iv.3.12.2 ) for a sketch of the proof . 
 [ l - linear - pencil ] each of the families @xmath286 and @xmath287 consists of level sets of some rational function  @xmath355 . 
 we use the following notions ; see @xcite for details . in order to apply intersection theory , 
 @xmath339 ; see the first paragraph of the proof of lemma  [ l - ruled ] . 
 a _ divisor _ on @xmath340 is a formal linear combination of irreducible algebraic curves on @xmath340 with integer coefficients . 
 closure of the preimage of an algebraic hypersurface under a rational map from @xmath340 to a projective space can be considered as a divisor , once the preimage is one - dimensional and one counts the irreducible components with their multiplicities . the collection of preimages of all the hyperplanes under a rational map 
 is called a _ linear family _ of divisors . in particular , a one - dimensional _ linear _ _ family _ of divisors is the collection of level sets of a rational function . 
 two divisors are _ linear equivalent _ , if they are contained in a one - dimensional linear family . 
 @xmath356 of two divisors @xmath357 and @xmath358 on @xmath340 is the number of their intersection points counted with multiplicities ( once the number of intersection points is finite ) . 
 two divisors are _ numerically equivalent _ , if their intersection with each algebraic curve on @xmath340 are equal , once the number of intersection points is finite . 
 the _ degree _ of a divisor is the sum of the degrees of the irreducible components counted with multiplicities . 
 the degree of a divisor equals the intersection of the divisor with a generic hyperplane section of @xmath359 . 
 assume to the contrary that one of the analytic families @xmath286 and @xmath287 , say , the first one , is not linear . by the hironaka 
 theorem the inverse map @xmath360 is defined everywhere except a finite set . 
 thus the pullback @xmath361 is an analytic family of algebraic curves . 
 we use the notation @xmath361 for the family of ( closed ) algebraic curves ( not to be confused with the set of preimages @xmath362 being algebraic curves possibly with a finite number of points removed ) . for an algebraic curve @xmath363 distinct from each @xmath364 
 the intersection @xmath365 continuously depends on @xmath366 , and hence is constant . 
 thus each two curves of the family @xmath364 are numerically equivalent . on a smooth rational surface , 
 numerical equivalence implies linear equivalence @xcite . 
 since @xmath286 is nonlinear it follows that @xmath364 is nonlinear and hence must be contained in a linear family of divisors in @xmath340 of dimension at least @xmath9 . 
 the image of the latter family under the projection @xmath367 is at least two - dimensional algebraic family @xmath311 of divisors on @xmath309 . 
 the divisors of the family @xmath311 are linear combinations of curves with positive coefficients , because they arise from a linear family ( and negative numbers can not occur as multiplicities of preimages ) . 
 all the divisors of the family @xmath311 have the same degree because their pullbacks are numerically equivalent . 
 ( indeed , for two divisors @xmath368 , and a general position hyperplane @xmath369 we have @xmath370 . ) 
 since the curves @xmath286 are conics it follows that the degrees of all these divisors are @xmath9 . 
 therefore the divisors of the family @xmath311 are either conics or pairs of lines or lines of multiplicity @xmath9 . 
 this is possible only if there are infinitely many conic sections or lines through each point in an open subset of the surface , which contradicts to the assumptions of theorem  [ schicho ] . thus both families @xmath286 and @xmath287 must be linear . 
 [ l - parametrization ] there is a rational map @xmath371 taking the families @xmath286 and @xmath287 to the sets of curves @xmath372 and @xmath373 respectively , such that the restriction of the map to some dense sets is bijective . 
 consider the pair of rational functions given by lemma  [ l - linear - pencil ] whose level sets are the two families of conics @xmath286 and @xmath287 . 
 the pair of rational functions defines a rational map @xmath371 . since for sufficiently small @xmath374 
 each pair @xmath286 and @xmath287 has an intersection point it follows that the image of this rational map contains a neighborhood of @xmath375 , and thus is dense . 
 since the intersection point is unique it follows that the point @xmath376 has exactly one preimage for sufficiently small @xmath374 , and hence for almost all @xmath377 . 
 thus the restriction of the rational map @xmath371 to appropriate dense subsets is bijective . 
 now we apply the following well - known result for which we could not find any direct reference . 
 ( we have found several more general results in the literature but each time the proof that the inverse map is rational , the only assertion we need , was omitted . )    [ l - postulate ] if a rational map between open dense subsets of rational surfaces is bijective then the inverse map is rational as well , and hence birational . 
 ( s. orevkov , private communication ) it suffices to prove the lemma for a map @xmath324 between open dense subsets of @xmath378 . for a generic @xmath379 the preimage 
 @xmath380 is an open dense subset of the algebraic curve @xmath381 defined by the algebraic equation @xmath382 in the variables @xmath383 , where @xmath384 is the first projection . 
 restrict the map @xmath324 to the preimage . 
 we get a bijective rational map between open dense subsets of the curves @xmath381 and @xmath373 . 
 clearly , it extends to a rational homeomorphism @xmath385 . 
 then by the classification of algebraic curves the curve @xmath381 is rational . 
 identify @xmath381 and @xmath373 with @xmath354 . 
 consider the graph of the rational map @xmath385 as a subset of @xmath378 . by elimination of variables 
 it follows that the graph is the zero set of some polynomial @xmath386 $ ] . 
 since the map @xmath385 is bijective it follows that the polynomial @xmath37 has degree @xmath114 in each variable and hence the inverse map @xmath387 is also rational . 
 this implies that the inverse map @xmath388 is rational in the variable @xmath366 for fixed generic @xmath104 . 
 analogously , @xmath388 is rational in @xmath104 for fixed generic @xmath366 . 
 thus @xmath388 is rational . 
 [ l - final ] assume that a birational map @xmath389 takes the sets of curves @xmath372 and @xmath373 to conics or lines . 
 write the birational map as @xmath390 for some coprime @xmath391 $ ] 
 . then @xmath392 .    for a birational map between surfaces , by elimination of indeterminacy ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem  ii.7 ) there is always an algebraic curve @xmath393 such that outside the curve @xmath393 the map is injective and has nondegenerate differential . 
 fix a generic value of @xmath27 . 
 denote @xmath394 . 
 the curve @xmath395 is a conic or a line . 
 cut it by a generic hyperplane @xmath396 in @xmath275 . 
 the intersection consists of at most @xmath9 points . by general position they are not contained in the image of @xmath393 . 
 since the @xmath397 are coprime it follows that @xmath398 have no common roots . 
 since the birational map is injective outside @xmath393 it follows that the equation @xmath399 has at most @xmath9 solutions . 
 these solutions have multiplicity @xmath114 because the birational map has nondegenerate differential outside @xmath393 . 
 this implies that the polynomials @xmath400 have degree at most @xmath9 . 
 analogously , @xmath401 have degree at most @xmath9 in @xmath27 , and the lemma follows . 
 it follows directly by lemmas  [ l - cover ] , [ l - algebraic ] , [ l - parametrization ] , [ l - postulate ] , [ l - final ] . 
 theorem  [ schicho ] remains true ( with almost the same proof ) without the assumption that the number of conic sections through certain points is finite except that then one can not conclude that the two drawn conic sections @xmath283 and @xmath284 are necessarily the curves @xmath41 and @xmath42 . 
 for the proof of corollary  [ haupt ] we need the following lemmas . in the rest of this section 
 @xmath402 is a surface satisfying the assumptions of corollary  [ haupt ] . 
 [ l - reduction ] the surface @xmath227 ( possibly besides a one - dimensional subset ) has parametrization  , where @xmath47 satisfy equation  , and @xmath403 runs through some ( not open ) subset of  @xmath277 . 
 since the circular arcs through each point of @xmath227 are noncospheric , their respective circles are transversal and intersect at a unique point . 
 extend @xmath404 analytically to a complex analytic surface @xmath309 in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath227 in @xmath275 modulo the boundary ( so that the boundaries of @xmath227 and @xmath309 are contained in the boundary of the neighbourhood ) . extend the two real analytic families of circular arcs in @xmath227 to complex analytic families of ( complex ) conics in @xmath275 . by analyticity @xmath309 
 satisfies the assumptions of theorem  [ schicho ] . by theorem  [ schicho ] the surface @xmath309 ( possibly besides a one - dimensional subset ) has parametrization   by polynomials @xmath392 such that the circular arcs have the form @xmath41 and @xmath42 . 
 ( however , the converse is not true : most of the curves @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not circular arcs but parts of complex conics in @xmath309 . ) since the surface @xmath309 is contained in the complex quadric extending the sphere @xmath49 , it follows that the polynomials satisfy equation  . 
 let us reparametrize the surface to make the polynomials @xmath405 real . 
 [ l - make - real ] the surface @xmath227 ( possibly besides a one - dimensional subset ) has a parametrization  , where @xmath47 satisfy equation  , and @xmath403 runs through certain open subset of  @xmath406 .    start with the parametrization given by lemma  [ l - reduction ] . 
 draw two circular arcs of the form @xmath41 and @xmath42 through a point of the surface @xmath227 . through another pair of points of the first circular arc , 
 draw two more circular arcs of the form @xmath42 . 
 perform a complex fractional - linear transformation of the parameter @xmath29 so that the second , the third , and the fourth circular arcs obtain the form @xmath407 , respectively ( we consider the part of the surface where the denominator of the transformation does not vanish ) . perform an analogous transformation of the parameter @xmath27 so that @xmath408 become circular arcs intersecting the circular arc @xmath233 . after performing the transformations and clearing denominators 
 we get a parametrization @xmath409 of the surface @xmath404 , where still @xmath47 and @xmath403 runs through a subset @xmath410 . 
 let us prove that actually @xmath411 . 
 take @xmath412 sufficiently close to @xmath413 . 
 then @xmath414 is a point of the surface @xmath227 sufficiently close to @xmath415 . draw the two circular arcs @xmath41 and @xmath42 through the point @xmath414 . by continuity it follows that the circular arc @xmath42 intersects the circular arc @xmath232 in @xmath227 . 
 the intersection point can only be @xmath416 . 
 in particular , we get @xmath417 . in a quadratically parametrized conic 
 , the cross - ratio of any four points equals the cross - ratio of their parameters . 
 since three ( real ) points @xmath418 of the circular arc @xmath232 have real @xmath29-parameters it follows that all ( but one ) points of the circular arc have real @xmath29-parameters . 
 in particular , @xmath419 . 
 analogously , @xmath420 . 
 we have proved that all @xmath412 sufficiently close to the origin are real . by the analyticity @xmath326 
 is an open subset of @xmath406 . 
 [ l - real ] let @xmath421 $ ] . 
 assume that for all the points @xmath403 from some open subset of @xmath406 the point @xmath422 is real . 
 then @xmath423 for some real @xmath424 $ ] and complex @xmath425 $ ] .    without loss of generality 
 assume that @xmath426 is not identically zero . 
 take @xmath427 such that @xmath428 is not identically zero and take generic real @xmath78 from the open set in question . by the assumption of the lemma @xmath422 
 hence @xmath429 is real , therefore @xmath430 . 
 since this holds for generic real @xmath78 it follows that @xmath431 as polynomials . 
 take decompositions @xmath432 into coprime reduced irreducible factors @xmath433-\mathbb{r}[u , v]$ ] , @xmath434 $ ] with the powers @xmath435 , and constant factors @xmath436 , @xmath437 . 
 since @xmath56 $ ] is a unique factorization domain , the relation @xmath431 implies that @xmath438 and @xmath439 for each @xmath440 . without loss of generality 
 assume that @xmath441 for each @xmath440 ( otherwise replace @xmath442 by @xmath443 and vice versa ) . 
 it remains to set @xmath444\end{aligned}\ ] ]    for a surface @xmath227 in @xmath49 the corollary follows from lemmas  [ l - reduction][l - real ] . 
 now consider a surface @xmath227 in @xmath445 . 
 project it stereographically to @xmath49 . 
 the resulting surface has a parametrization as granted by the theorem for @xmath49 . 
 thus the initial surface has the parametrization @xmath446 with @xmath447 , as required . 
 the following result is useful for applications of corollary  [ haupt ] . 
 if through each point of an analytic surface in @xmath0 one can draw infinitely many circular arcs fully contained in the surface then the surface is a subset of a sphere or a plane . 
 perform inverse stereographic projection of the surface to @xmath7 . by remark  [ rem - infinity ] 
 the resulting surface is covered by at least 2-dimensional algebraic family of conics and hence circles . 
 the circles of the family passing through a particular point must cover an open subset of the surface . 
 project the surface back to @xmath0 from this point . 
 we get a surface containing a line segment and infinitely many circular arcs through almost each point . by ( 
 * theorem  1 ) the resulting surface is a subset of a quadric or a plane . 
 since it is covered by a 2-dimensional family of circles , by the classification of quadrics the resulting surface , and hence initial one , is a subset of a sphere or a plane . 
 we conclude the section by an open problem : does the lemma remain true in dimension @xmath448 ? 
 in this section we prove the results concerning factorization of quaternionic polynomials : splitting lemma  [ l - splitting - basic ] , corollary  [ cor - splitting ] , and give some examples and final remarks . 
 consider the polynomial @xmath453 obtained by substitution of the quaternion @xmath454 into the _ 
 polynomial @xmath455 . 
 on one hand , @xmath456 is divisible by @xmath457 of degree @xmath9 . on the other hand 
 , @xmath458 has degree at most @xmath114 because @xmath459 is a constant . 
 thus @xmath460 identically , i.e. , @xmath461 . 
 [ ex - beauregard ] ( beauregard @xcite ) . 
 the polynomial @xmath470 is irreducible in @xmath59 $ ] but @xmath471 is reducible in @xmath472 $ ] . in particular , @xmath473 are two decompositions in @xmath59 $ ] with different number of irreducible factors .      first consider the case when one of these polynomials , say , @xmath37 , does not depend on one of variables , say , @xmath29 . then write @xmath476 . both @xmath477 and @xmath478 must be left - divisible by @xmath479 , a contradiction by taking @xmath232 . 
 it remains to consider the case when @xmath480 . 
 since @xmath481 and @xmath472 $ ] is a unique factorization domain it follows that @xmath482 is product of two quadratic factors . by splitting lemma  [ l - splitting - basic ] 
 the polynomial @xmath37 is reducible in @xmath59 $ ] . 
 the left factor in a decomposition of @xmath483 is a left divisor of @xmath65 and does not depend on one of the variables , which leads to the first case already considered above . in both cases 
 we get a contradiction which proves that @xmath65 is irreducible . 
 it is interesting to obtain _ octonion _ counterparts of the results of this section . in particular 
 , this could help to find all surfaces in @xmath16 containing two circles through each point for @xmath488 . 
 let us give some final remarks . 
 simple formula   produces surfaces in @xmath17 containing two circles through each point . 
 however , it does not give _ all _ such surfaces in @xmath17 and is not convenient to produce such surfaces in @xmath0 . 
 thus we suggest the following alternative approach to surface construction . 
 the _ ( top - left ) quasideterminant _ of a @xmath109 matrix @xmath489 with the entries from @xmath59 $ ] is the following expression @xcite : @xmath490 if @xmath491 is linear in @xmath27 , @xmath492 is linear in @xmath29 , and all the other entries @xmath493 are generic constants then by the homological relations ( * ? ? ? 
 * theorem  1.4.2(i ) ) the quasideterminant is fraction - linear in each of the variables @xmath27 and @xmath29 . thus @xmath494 is a surface in @xmath17 containing @xmath9 circles through each point ( by lemma  [ l - axial ] above ) . 
 if the matrix @xmath495 is skew - hermitian then the surface actually lies in @xmath0 . 
 similarly , if @xmath496 , @xmath497 is a constant , @xmath498 , @xmath499 , @xmath492 are linear in @xmath27 , @xmath491 , @xmath500 are linear in @xmath29 then @xmath494 is again a surface in @xmath17 containing @xmath9 circles through each point . 
 it is interesting , if there is a natural class of matrices with the entries from @xmath59 $ ] such that _ all _ surfaces containing @xmath9 noncospheric circles through each point arise as the quasideterminants .

 the reduction is based on the schicho parametrization of surfaces containing two conics through each point and a new approach using quaternionic rational parametrization .    * keywords * : darboux cyclide , circle , moebius geometry , quaternion , pythagorean n - tuple    * 2010 msc * : 51b10 , 14j26 , 16h05", if the restriction of a rational map to certain open dense subsets of and is bijective and the inverse map is rational as well then is called a _ birational map_ a rational map is called a _ rational function_ a projective algebraic surface is _ unirationally ruled _ or simply _ uniruled _ if for some algebraic curve there is a rational map with dense image. the authors are grateful to n lubbes for the movie in figure movie and many useful remarks to l shi for the photo in figure movie to a pakharev for pointing out that numerous surfaces we tried to invent have form and to s galkin s ivanov w khnel n lubbes s orevkov r pignatelli f polizzi h pottmann g robinson j schicho k shramov v timorin m verbitsky s zub for useful discussions. by the enriques theorem theorem vi 17 and proposition iii 21 a smooth projective algebraic surface is birationally ruled if and only if for each the tensor power of the exterior square of the cotangent bundle has no sections except identical zero in other terminology _ the surface has kodaira dimension _ or _ all plurigeni vanish _ . the _ top left quasideterminant _ of a matrix with the entries from is the following expression if is linear in is linear in and all the other entries are generic constants then by the homological relations theorem 1 4 2 i the quasideterminant is fraction linear in each of the variables and.  mainthm if through each point of an analytic surface in one can draw two transversal circular arcs fully contained in the surface and analytically depending on the point then the surface is a mbius transformation of a subset of either a darboux cyclide or euclidean or clifford translational surface.  rem infinity if we drop the assumption that the number of conic through certain points is finite in theorem schicho then a similar argument shows that is contained in an algebraic surface and is contained in an algebraic subvariety of the variety of all conics in such that.  schicho assume that through each point of an analytic surface in a domain in complex projective space one can draw two transversal conic sections intersecting each other only at this point and analytically depending on the point such that their intersections with the domain are contained in the surface.  cols all these examples are particular cases of a _ darboux cyclide _ i e a subset of given by the equation where and of degree do not vanish simultaneously see figure movie to the left. we conjecture that the following generalization of lemma l rational is true _ an algebraic surface containing two rational curves through almost each point is rational_ see definition iv 3 2 theorems iv 5 4 iv 3 10 3 corollary iv 5 2 1 exercise iv 3 12 2 for a sketch of the proof. theorem schicho in particular implies that each surface containing two conic sections through each point is contained in an projective subspace of dimension at most and has the degree at most by standard elimination of variables ,0.17696160267111855,0.05360134003350083,0.1035058430717863
73,"bigravity is a theory of gravity with two independent _ dynamical _ metrics ( denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . 
 the action , first considered by isham - salam - strathdee @xcite , is @xmath2 & = & { 1 \over 16\pi g } \int \big[\ \sqrt{g } r(g ) + \sigma\ , \sqrt{f } r(f)- u(g , f ) \big]\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath3 is an interaction potential depending both on @xmath4 and @xmath5 . 
 the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 measures the relative strengths of both newton s constants . 
 bigravity has received intermittent but consistent attention since it was first presented . 
 for some recent work see @xcite . 
 the first question one may ask is what is the physical metric determining the geometry of spacetime . 
 this is the same as asking to what metric do particles couple to . 
 we refer the reader to the literature for discussions on many different interpretations . in this work 
 , we shall work entirely on vacuum space filled only by the two metrics . 
 the problem we shall be concerned regularity of the black hole horizon is independent on the interpretation for the bigravity theory . 
 the potential considered in @xcite was is replaced by @xmath7 which is consistent with diff invariance . 
 we have set @xmath8 for simplicity , and to make contact with @xcite . ] 
 @xmath9 where @xmath10 has dimensions of mass . 
 flat space @xmath11 is a solution to the equations of motion . 
 the linear theory around this solution @xmath12 describes @xcite a massless graviton because the action is diff invariant . 
 ] @xmath13 plus a massive one @xmath14 with a pauli - fierz mass term . 
 the mass is equal to @xmath15 and the effective newton s constant is @xmath16 . 
 stability / unitarity of the linear theory then requires the two conditions @xmath17    the potential ( [ u1 ] ) breaks the original diff@xmath18diff symmetry down to the diagonal subgroup . 
 the linear theory is nevertheless well - behaved because the mass term has the pauli - fierz form . 
 [ see @xcite for a general non - go theorem forbidding cross interactions between @xmath19 gravitons preserving diff@xmath20 . ] 
 the applications of bigravity to massive gravity has been extensively discussed in the literature and we shall omit here . our main goal is to discuss the properties of black holes . 
 black hole thermodynamics in massive gravity ( with a different action ) has been studied in @xcite . 
 the main goal of this paper is to study in detail the properties of black holes solutions to the action ( [ i ] ) . 
 we shall argue in sec . 
 [ issol ] that the solutions found in @xcite , associated to the potential ( [ u1 ] ) , do not have regular horizons and thus they can not represent black holes . 
 there exists , however , a much larger class of potentials accepting exact solutions and having a unitary / stable linear theory @xcite . in sec . 
 [ newu ] we consider a more general potential ( with two parameters ) and show that regular solutions do exist . 
 we then compute the total energy , entropy , temperature and discuss the thermodynamical properties . 
 we shall see that phase transitions exist when @xmath21 , which is allowed by unitarity / stability . 
 soon after the action ( [ i ] ) was proposed , solutions with spherical symmetry of the form @xmath22 were discovered by isham and storey does not introduce conical singularities because these solutions are asymptotically ( a)ds , and have horizons . 
 we thank r. mann for a useful conversation on this point . ] 
 @xcite . for our purposes here is enough to mention that @xmath23 and @xmath24 have the schwarzschild - ads form @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 are independent integration constants and @xmath28 . 
 the cosmological constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 are combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath27 . 
 see @xcite for full details . 
 a remarkable property of the solution , already noticed in @xcite , is that @xmath1 can also be brought to a schwarzschild form via a coordinate change @xmath31 , with a suitable @xmath32 . in the new coordinate system 
 the metric @xmath1 takes the form , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a constant . 
 the zero s of @xmath24 then represent horizons for the metric @xmath1 . 
 the full solution is then simply two schwarzschild metrics written in different coordinate system . 
 the isham - storey solution fulfills another remarkable property . 
 consider an arbitrary linear combination of both metrics @xmath35 since @xmath1 is off - diagonal , the metric @xmath36 is also off - diagonal . 
 one can introduce a new time coordinate @xmath37 defined by @xmath38 , and again , for a suitable choice of @xmath39 the metric @xmath36 becomes diagonal . 
 the remarkable property is that for _ any _ choice of @xmath40 this metric again has the schwarzschild form @xmath41 where @xmath42 are constants that depend on @xmath42 , and @xmath43 depend on all parameters @xmath44 . 
 this metric represents a black hole with a new mass parameters that depends on the particular linear combination . 
 in particular , the location of the horizon depends on @xmath40 . 
 thus , for fixed values of @xmath45 , the isham - storey solution generates a whole family of black holes with horizons at arbitrary locations .    summarizing , at first sight , the isham - storey configuration has ( at least ) two horizons -one for each metric- defined by the points where the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 vanish . 
 these ( candidate ) horizons are located at different and independent points in spacetime because the zeroes of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined by independent integrations constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 . 
 this interpretation is however not correct . 
 the isham - storey configuration is singular because , as we now show , there is no coordinate system where both horizons can be made regular simultaneously .    as a first attempt to prove regularity , 
 the metric @xmath0 can be put in eddington - flinkestein coordinates @xcite making it regular at its own horizon . 
 remarkably , the metric @xmath1 becomes regular at that point as well . 
 however , this can only be achieved for either ingoing or outgoing coordinates ( depending on the choice of sign for @xmath48 ) , but not for both simultaneously . as it is well - known @xcite 
 , only half of the eddington - flinkestein coordinates is not enough to declare regularity . 
 let us concentrate on the @xmath0 horizon defined by the condition @xmath49 if @xmath50 this equation has more than one positive solution . 
 the argument that follows applies to all regular horizons . 
 we assume , however , that the horizon is non - extremal , that is @xmath51 . 
 the argument can be generalized to extreme horizons as well . defining a proper radial coordinate @xmath52 in a neighborhood of the horizon 
 , the metric @xmath0 can be brought to the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant . 
 the 1-form @xmath55 is singular at the horizon ( now located at @xmath56 ) but @xmath57 is regular . 
 the metric ( [ a ] ) represents a regular spacetime written in singular hyperbolic polar coordinates . 
 let us now look at the metric @xmath1 in the neighborhood of @xmath58 . 
 the functions @xmath59 take finite values at that point and thus , naively , the metric @xmath1 looks regular , @xmath60 here @xmath61 and @xmath62 are non - zero for generic values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . 
 then , since the 1-form @xmath55 is singular at @xmath63 ( or @xmath64 ) , the metric ( [ fhor ] ) is actually singular there . a more geometrical way to see 
 this is to note that the set of points @xmath65 with fixed angular variables correspond to a timelike one - dimensional curve in the metric @xmath1 , but a 0-dimensional point in the metric @xmath0 . 
 this means that metric @xmath0 requires that the above set of points should be identified , while metric @xmath1 require them to be all independent . 
 the only way to make this metric regular is to assume that @xmath24 and @xmath48 also vanish at @xmath63 ( with appropriate weights ) . a more explicit way to reach to the same conclusion 
 is to put the metric ( [ a ] ) in regular cartesian coordinates . 
 this can always be done in a neighborhood of its horizon . 
 then one looks at the metric @xmath1 in this ( regular ) coordinate system . 
 it follows that @xmath1 can be regular at the horizon of @xmath0 if and only if its own horizon is also located there .    in summary , 
 if @xmath58 and @xmath66 denote , respectively , the solutions to @xmath67 and @xmath68 we have concluded that @xmath0 is singular at @xmath66 , and @xmath1 is singular at @xmath69 . 
 the only truly regular solution is one with @xmath70 . 
 this solution does exist , but corresponds to a proportional case @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is a constant ) , where @xmath0 is the schwarzschild metric . 
 this particular solution is the only regular black hole within the family of isham - storey solutions . 
 it is instructive to recall the reissner - nordstrom black hole system having a non - zero coulomb field @xmath73 . 
 the same arguments exhibited above imply that the potential @xmath74 must be zero at the horizon if one demands the 1-form @xmath75 to be regular there . 
 for the reissner - nordstrom black hole , this can always be achieved via a suitable gauge transformation .    the isham - storey exact solution associated to the potential ( [ u1 ] ) 
 can not be interpreted as a black hole , but only as the exterior solution to some mass distribution in bigravity . 
 we were motivated by the question of whether or not the singularity at the horizon was a generic property of bigravity , or a property of the particular isham - salam - strathdee potential ( [ u1 ] ) . 
 the potential ( [ u1 ] ) is one member within the infinite dimensional family of potentials @xcite given rise to a unitary and stable linear pauli - fierz theory . 
 it is then natural to ask whether or not other potentials may give rise to regular black holes . to answer this question ( in a simple way without trying to prove a general theorem ) 
 we shall consider the 2-parameter family of potentials , @xmath76.\end{aligned}\ ] ] note that for all @xmath77 , this potential belongs to the pauli - fierz class as defined in @xcite , and that for @xmath78 we recover the potential ( [ u1 ] ) . 
 see @xcite for a much larger class of potentials admitting exact solutions . 
 we shall see that , for generic values of @xmath77 , regular , non - trivial ( i.e. , non - proportional ) black hole solutions do exist . since the condition @xmath79 represents an open set one can conjecture that , generically , the pauli - fierz family of potentials does accept regular black holes solutions .    before displaying the exact solution to the potential ( [ u2 ] ) we mention that ( i ) the potential ( [ u2 ] ) also accepts the background @xmath80 . 
 the linear spectrum contains a massless field plus a pauli - fierz massive theory . 
 the mass is now , @xmath81 as in the previous case , @xmath82 must be positive to avoid ghosts . 
 then , linear unitarity / stability holds for @xmath83    our goal is to prove that a regular solutions exist , not to classify all solutions , which is a hard task . 
 we consider the family of potentials where @xmath10 is positive while @xmath77 is negative . 
 we write them in the form , @xmath84    the metric components are more complicated albeit exact @xcite . the metric ansatz is again given by ( [ ans ] ) , and the functions @xmath85 are now given by the following expressions , @xmath86 the exponent @xmath87 and the cosmological constants are given by @xmath88 here @xmath89 is a new constant defined by @xmath90 unlike the isham - storey solution , now the parameter @xmath91 entering in the ansatz ( [ ans ] ) is an arbitrary constant . 
 note that this solution describes ( anti)-de sitter solutions even though there is no cosmological constant in the action . 
 the main difference with respect to the isham - storey solution is the new term @xmath92 . 
 as shown in @xcite , these terms are generic and appear for a large class of potentials .    given the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 above , the function @xmath93 is most easily expressed as the solution to the following simple relation @xmath94 finally , knowing @xmath24 and @xmath93 , the function @xmath48 is given by @xmath95 these relations fix completely all unknown functions . 
 we then have an exact solution to the equations of motion following from the action ( [ i ] ) with the potential ( [ u2 ] ) . 
 contrary to the isham - storey solution , the parameter @xmath96 entering in the ansatz ( [ ans ] ) is now an arbitrary integration constant . 
 the range of this constant is severely restricted if we demand the charge @xmath97 to be localized . since @xmath97 enters in the metric in the form @xmath92 where @xmath87 is given in ( [ alpha ] ) . demanding @xmath87 to be positive requires 
 @xmath98 a plot of @xmath99 is displayed in fig . 
 ( [ alpha.fig ] ) .    . 
 in the range @xmath100 the exponent @xmath87 is always positive and greater than @xmath101.[alpha.fig ] ]    the cosmological constants appearing in our exact solution are not fundamental constants but depend on the state ( see ( [ alpha ] ) ) . 
 we plot in fig . 
 [ cosm ] the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the allowed range of @xmath91 given in ( [ k0 ] ) . 
 we see that de sitter and anti - de sitter phase may coexist . 
 we refer the reader to @xcite for a variational formulation on de sitter spaces . 
 note that for @xmath102 , which will turn out to be the most interesting case , both cosmological constants are negative for most values of @xmath96 , with a small de sitter window .     and @xmath103 . 
 left panel @xmath104 ; right panel @xmath102 . 
 [ cosm ] ]    the main property of this solution is the appearance of 4 integration constants @xmath105 and @xmath91 . 
 one would like to give an interpretation to these constants in terms of asymptotic conserved charges . 
 this is however not possible . 
 as has been extensively discussed in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) , bigravity solutions break lorentz ( or de sitter ) invariance . 
 in fact , in our case , the only asymptotic killing vector is constant time translations . in this sense 
 there is only one conserved charge at infinity . 
 interestingly , black holes do indeed have only one charge . as we see in next section regularity of the horizon 
 imposes three restrictions on the values of @xmath106 . as a result 
 , there is only one remaining free parameter that we can identify as the total energy ( conjugate to time translations ) . 
 the horizon for the metric @xmath0 is given by the inner solution of the equation @xmath107 . 
 ( the outer solution , if any , will be a cosmological horizon ) . 
 as before , the metric @xmath1 has its own horizon defined by the equation @xmath108 . as discussed before , 
 the only way to have a regular horizon is to ensure that both @xmath24 and @xmath23 vanish at the same point . 
 moreover , the function @xmath48 -which appears in the metric multiplied by the singular 1-form @xmath55- has to vanish at the horizon as well . 
 there is one more restriction to achieve regularity . 
 the  temperatures "" of both metrics must be the same . 
 this is a condition in either the minkowskian or euclidean sectors . 
 kruskal coordinates will exists simultaneously for both metrics provided the derivatives @xmath109 and @xmath110 evaluated at @xmath63 are correlated . 
 this is most easily seen in the euclidean sector as a condition eliminating a conical singularity . 
 but it is equally valid in the minkowskian sector as a condition for the kruskal extension to exist .    summarizing , 
 let @xmath69 the zero of @xmath23 , @xmath111 recall that @xmath23 is given in ( [ sol ] ) . 
 this equation merely defines @xmath58 without really imposing any restriction . 
 now , we demand the horizon of the @xmath1 metric to be located at the same spacetime point , that is @xmath112 next , as discussed above , we also demand the function @xmath48 to vanish at this point @xmath113 finally , the temperatures of both horizons must be the same so that a kruskal extension exists for both simultaneously . 
 this condition reads @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a complicated constant that we prefer to omit . 
 ideally , one would like to use ( [ h],[x],[h],[t ] ) to express , for example , @xmath106 in terms of @xmath58 . 
 this is algebraically impossible . 
 what we can do , it to use these equations to write @xmath105 as functions of @xmath91 . 
 thus , a regular black hole is built by choosing a value of @xmath96 , within the allowed range ( [ k0 ] ) . 
 once @xmath96 is given , all other charges @xmath116 take definite values . 
 the explicit formulas are analytical but not very illuminating so we skip them . 
 it is more illustrative to present plots of @xmath117 for the allowed range of @xmath91 . 
 ( [ sigmapos.fig ] ) shows @xmath105 for @xmath6 positive and fig . 
 ( [ sigmaneg.fig ] ) shows @xmath105 for @xmath6 negative . 
 these pictures are generic and do not change drastically for small variations of the parameters within the allowed ranges . 
 @xmath118 , @xmath119 ]     @xmath118 , @xmath120 ]       one may be concerned that imposing all these conditions require severe fine tuning and the solution is highly non - generic . 
 note , however , that this fine tuning must not be imposed . 
 the parameters @xmath121 of the solutions are not conserved quantities . only one particular combination of them , the total energy , which will be discussed in the next section , is conserved during gravitational collapse . 
 the particular way the collapse takes place will not be considered here , but it is a sensible guess , that in order to satisfy the cosmic censorship conjecture , the parameters will evolve to an equilibrium value that fulfill the constraint . from the canonical point of view 
 we expect that this may also be derived from an extremum principle , in the same way that the constraint relating energy and temperature may be derived in the euclidean treatment of black hole thermodynamics . 
 we leave this to future work . 
 we now turn to the problem of computing the mass , and thermodynamical functions for this black hole .    ideally , we should set up boundary conditions appropriated to the black hole problem , preserving some asymptotic group . 
 however , bigravity solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor ( anti-)de sitter . for the black holes displayed above , each metric is asymptotically ( anti- ) de sitter but with different speeds of light . 
 there is no obvious asymptotic structure one would like to preserve . in order to move forward 
 we do the calculation in the quickest way by allowing in the variational principle at least the family of metrics described by eh black hole , varying all parameters . 
 since the potential in the action has no derivatives of the fields , it does not contribute to the boundary terms . 
 the total energy is clearly given by two adm functionals , one for each metric . by usual methods @xcite 
 , we find for the variation of the hamiltonian , @xmath122 plus terms that vanish on - shell . 
 as explained above , the second line follows by plugging the black hole solution in the variation of the boundary term , varying all parameters . 
 @xmath123 is a expected contribution from @xmath124 while the second term comes from @xmath125 . 
 it is very interesting to observe that both @xmath126 and @xmath127 have divergent contributions ( as @xmath128 ) . 
 these are expected because the metrics have terms of the form @xmath129 where @xmath29 is not a fundamental constant . 
 instead , @xmath29 depends on integration constants ( see ( [ alpha ] ) ) which are varied in the action principle . 
 however , these divergent pieces nicely cancel each other and the sum @xmath130 remains finite . 
 a phenomenon like this one has been observed in other systems @xcite . 
 a general argument has been given in @xcite . 
 note that the second term depends on @xmath47 and @xmath91 . 
 one may conclude that this solution has a new asymptotic symplectic pair @xmath131 ( a charge with a corresponding chemical potential ) . 
 this interpretation is however not correct . 
 there is only one asymptotic time translation symmetry and only the total energy is a conserved charge . 
 integrability of the total energy then implies that @xmath47 can not be varied arbitrarily , but must be a function of @xmath91 . 
 we have already seen that @xmath47 is related to @xmath96 for regular black holes . 
 we use this relation and write the total energy as @xmath132 where @xmath133 is plotted in figs . 
 [ sigmapos.fig ] and [ sigmaneg.fig ] as function of @xmath91 . 
 we have arbitrarily chosen @xmath134 as a reference state . 
 this is an allowed value and corresponds to the point where the exponent @xmath99 takes its minimum value @xmath135 . 
 the temperature of the black hole can be computed either from the @xmath0 or @xmath1 black hole . applying the usual formula for the @xmath0 black hole , @xmath136    in fig . 
 [ beta ] we plot the temperature for two choices of parameters @xmath137 and @xmath138 
 . focus first on the left panel with @xmath139 . 
 we see that for a given value of @xmath140 ( not too large ) there exists two values of @xmath91 , and hence two values of @xmath105 . in the canonical ensemble , where @xmath140 is fixed , 
 there exists two black holes consistent with that temperature . to discern which one is realized one needs to compute the free energy . for negative values of @xmath6 
 the situation is even more interesting . on the right panel 
 we plot @xmath141 for @xmath142 . for a given value of @xmath140 
 there are up to 4 values of @xmath91 and thus 4 states . 
 again , to discern which one is the most stable one we need to compute the free energy . the free energy will also tell us whether or not phase transitions among these states can occur or not . 
 we do this calculation in the next section .    . 
 in this case , there are two states ( two values of @xmath91 ) for each temperature . 
 right panel : @xmath142 . 
 here there are up to four states for each temperature . 
 this indicates possible phase transitions . 
 the temperature @xmath143 diverges near the extreme allowed values @xmath144 and @xmath145 . 
 the horizon also vanishes at those points and the behavior resembles that of schwarzschild . ] 
 as shown in fig . ( [ beta ] ) , for a given temperature there can be up to 4 values of @xmath91 . 
 hence , for a given temperature there may be up to four different black hole metrics . to decide which is thermodynamically favored we need to compute the free energy @xmath146 . 
 the logic here mimics step by step the usual gr calculation , although the details are more involved . 
 the full hamiltonian action must be supplemented by two boundary terms at the horizon and infinity , @xmath147 where @xmath148 is given in ( [ e ] ) and ( @xmath149 ) @xmath150 this formula for the horizon boundary term follows from general grounds ( it can also be derived straightforwardly ) . 
 indeed , the full action is a sum of einstein - hilbert actions . 
 therefore , the total entropy is expected to be a sum of the individual bekenstein - hawking entropies . 
 note that the second action is multiplied by @xmath6 , hence the second entropy is multiplied by @xmath6 . 
 up to this point , the horizon @xmath58 has no logical relation with the asymptotic charges @xmath26 , etc . the action principle ( [ if ] 
 ) is appropriated to black hole fields having a horizon at some arbitrary point @xmath58 . 
 the next step is to evaluate the action on a saddle - point approximation . 
 this has two implications . 
 first , we solve the constraints plugging the regular black hole solution . 
 the bulk pieces vanish ( because there are a combination of constraints ) and the total action becomes @xmath151 where now the entropy does depend on the asymptotic charge . 
 this is not the end yet . 
 since @xmath148 is varied ( @xmath140 is fixed ) , there is one remaining equation @xmath152 which implies the first law : @xmath153 of course , one can check that this value for @xmath140 is consistent with the ` no - cone ' condition ( [ t ] ) . 
 the free energy @xmath154 is a function of the temperature . 
 let us now evaluate @xmath155 for various cases . 
 as before , the formulas are analytic but not very illuminating . 
 we display the main results with plots . 
 note that both @xmath156 and @xmath141 ( for all allowed @xmath91 ) are known and hence we can plot @xmath155 parametrically . 
 we shall vary the couplings @xmath137 and @xmath138 in a way consistent with stability / unitarity of the linear theory , as discussed in sec . 
 [ newu ] . for given values of @xmath157 
 we then vary @xmath91 within the range ( [ k0 ] ) . 
 first , consider the case @xmath158 . 
 recall that for @xmath6 positive @xmath159 must be bigger than @xmath138 . 
 the right panel in fig . 
 [ s+ ] shows @xmath155 . 
 we recall that for a given value of @xmath140 there are two values of @xmath91 ( left panel ) and thus two allowed states . as a consequence , 
 the free energy is a multi - valued function of @xmath140 and the lowest value determines the most stable state . in this case , the lowest @xmath160 corresponds to the value of @xmath140 with the biggest @xmath91 . 
 this is true in the whole range of @xmath91 and hence there are no phase transitions in this case .     and @xmath161    a more interesting situation occurs for @xmath162 ( for @xmath102 , linear unitarity / stability requires @xmath163 ) . 
 we plot in fig . 
 [ s-1 ] @xmath155 . as before , 
 there exists two states for a given @xmath140 . 
 however , in this case , there exists a phase transition for @xmath164 . for @xmath165 , 
 the most stable state is the one with biggest @xmath91 , while for @xmath166 , the most stable state is the one with smallest @xmath91 . 
 the physical free energy is the envelope of the curve @xmath155 with a discontinuous derivative at @xmath167 . 
 hence , a first order phase transition takes place at that temperature . 
 and @xmath168    an even richer situation arises if we increase the value of @xmath138 , leaving @xmath159 fixed . 
 for @xmath169 we plot in fig . 
 [ s-2 ] the temperature and @xmath155 . for the range @xmath170 , four states are available for a given @xmath140 . 
 the free energy @xmath155 ( right panel ) also exhibits this degeneracy and allows to determine the most stable state : for @xmath171 and @xmath172 corresponds to the the biggest value of @xmath91 , and for @xmath173 corresponds to the second biggest value of @xmath91 . 
 + in this case , there appears to be a 
 zero - order "" phase transition when crossing the critical values @xmath174 and @xmath175 . 
 this hypothetical zero - order phase transitions has been discussed before in the context of self - gravitating gases ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) .     and @xmath176    finally , in fig .

 to conclude , we have argued that the isham - storey exact solution can not represent a black hole but the exterior solution to a spherical star . 
 this is not a generic property of bigravity , but of the potential chosen by isham and storey . for more generic potentials 
 we find more integration constants in the solutions , which may be fine tuned to produce a regular horizon . 
 we have computed the total energy , temperature and free energy of these solutions and have found several phases in the canonical formalism .

74,"a new class of massive x - ray binaries has been recognized in the last few years , mainly thanks to observations carried out with the _ integral _ satellite . 
 they are transient x - ray sources associated to o or b supergiant stars and characterized by short outbursts . these _ supergiant fast x@xmath0ray transients _ ( sfxts ) [ @xcite ; @xcite ] 
 are remarkably different from the classical high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) with supergiant companions , that are bright persistent sources , and also differ from the be transients for their optical companions and shorter outbursts . 
 the outbursts of sfxts involve a high dynamic range , spanning 3 to 5 orders of magnitudes , from a quiescent luminosity of @xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 up to the peak luminosity of @xmath3  erg  s@xmath2 . 
 the outbursts typically last a few days and are composed of many short flares with duration of a few hours . besides these bright outbursts 
 , the sfxts can display a fainter flaring activity with luminosity @xmath4  erg  s@xmath2 @xcite . 
 different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the sfxts properties ( see @xcite and references therein for a recent review ) . 
 @xcite , proposed that sfxts outbursts are due to the presence of an equatorial wind component , denser and slower than the spherically symmetric wind from the supergiant , and possibly inclined with respect to the orbital plane of the system . 
 the enhanced accretion rate occurring when the neutron star crosses this wind component can explain sfxts showing periodic outbursts , such as igr  j11215@xmath05952 and also other sfxts , assuming different geometries for the outflowing equatorial wind . 
 another possibility involves the gated mechanisms due to transitions across the centrifugal barrier @xcite.@xcite showed that a centrifugal or a magnetic barrier can explain the sfxts properties only if the supergiant wind is inhomogeneous , and the accreting neutron star has a strong magnetic field ( @xmath5  g ) and a long spin period ( @xmath6  s ) . 
 @xcite proposed that the sfxts flares are produced by accretion of clumps of matter from the companion wind . in the framework of 
 the clumpy wind model proposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite proposed that what distinguishes the sfxts from the persistent hmxbs with supergiant companions is their different orbital separation : in persistently bright sources the compact object orbits the companion at a small distance ( @xmath72 stellar radii ) where there is a high number density of clumps , while the transient emission in sfxts is produced by accretion of much rarer clumps present at larger distances . on the other hand 
 , the monitoring with _ swift _ of a sample of four sfxts @xcite has demonstrated that these sources accrete matter also outside the bright outbursts , so any model should also account for this important observational property . 
 the winds of o and b type stars are driven by the momentum transfer of the radiation field and @xcite showed that the dominant mechanism is the line scattering . 
 the analytical formulation for line - driven winds has been developed by @xcite ( cak ) . in the cak theory 
 the mass lost by the star is smoothly accelerated by the momentum transferred from the stellar continuum radiation , and forms a stationary and homogeneous wind . 
 however , both observational evidence and theoretical considerations indicate that the stellar winds are variable and non homogeneous . 
 changes in the uv line profiles , revealing wind variability , have been observed on time scales shorter than a day @xcite . 
 the x - ray variability observed in 4u  1700@xmath0377 , vela  x@xmath01 and other hmxbs can be explained in terms of wind inhomogeneity [ @xcite ; @xcite ] and further indications for the presence of clumps come from x@xmath0ray spectroscopy . 
 for example , the x@xmath0ray spectrum of vela  x@xmath01 during the eclipse phase shows recombination lines produced by a hot ionized gas and fluorescent k - shell lines produced by cool and dense gas of near - neutral ions @xcite . 
 these authors proposed that the coexistence of highly ionized and near neutral ions can be explained with an inhomogeneous wind , where cool , dense clumps are embedded in a lower density , highly ionized medium . 
 @xcite suggested that the wind acceleration is subject to a strong instability since small perturbations in the velocity or density distribution grow with time producing a variable and strongly structured wind . 
 the first time - dependent hydrodynamical simulations of unstable line - driven winds were performed by @xcite and , more recently , by @xcite and @xcite . 
 all these simulations show that the line - driven instability produces a highly structured wind , with reverse and forward shocks that compress the gas into clumps . 
 moreover , the shock heating can generate a hot inter - clump medium into which the colder clumps are immersed @xcite .    based on these considerations 
 , we study in this work the expected variability and x@xmath0ray luminosity properties of neutron stars accreting from a clumpy wind . in the next two sections 
 we describe our clumpy wind model and the assumptions for the mass accretion . in section 
 [ application of the clumpy wind model ] we study the dependence of the parameters introduced in the previous sections . in sections 
 [ study of the hmxb vela x-1 ] , [ study of the sgxb 4u 1700 - 377 ] and [ study of the sfxt igr j11215 - 5952 ] we compare the x - ray light curves predicted with our model to the observations of three high mass x - ray binaries , showing that it is possible to reproduce well the observed flaring behaviors . 
 in our model , where the dynamical problem has not been treated , we assume that a fraction of the stellar wind is in form of clumps with a power law mass distribution    @xmath8    in the mass range @xmath9 - @xmath10 . 
 the rate of clumps produced by the supergiant is related to the total mass loss rate @xmath11 by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fraction of mass lost in clumps and @xmath14 is the average clump mass , which can be computed from equation ( [ npunto ] ) . 
 clumps are driven radially outward by absorption of uv spectral lines @xcite . from spectroscopic observations of o stars , 
 @xcite suggest that clumps follow on average the same velocity law of a smooth stellar wind 
 . we can then assume the following clump velocity profile without solving the dynamical problem : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the terminal wind velocity , @xmath17 is the radius of the supergiant , @xmath18 is a parameter which ensures that @xmath19  km  s@xmath2 , and @xmath20 is a constant in the range @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 [ @xcite ; @xcite ] . 
 assuming that the clumps are confined by the ram pressure of the ambient gas , their size can be derived by the balance pressure equation . 
 following @xcite and @xcite , the average density of a clump is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the density profile of the homogeneous ( inter - clump ) wind , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the inter - clump wind and the clump thermal velocity , respectively : @xmath28 and @xmath29 . 
 @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the temperatures of the inter - clump wind and of the clumps , respectively , and @xmath33 is the mean atomic weight . 
 the constant @xmath34 accounts for the confining effect of the bow shock produced by the ram pressure around the clump @xcite . 
 @xmath35 is the relative velocity between the wind and the clump ( @xmath36 ) . adopting @xmath37  cm  s@xmath2 , @xmath38  k , @xmath39  k and @xmath40 
 , we obtain : @xmath41 since the density radial profile @xmath25 of the homogeneous inter - clump wind ( obtained from the continuity equation @xmath42 ) is : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a generic distance from the supergiant , from equations ( [ lucy_white ] ) , ( [ lucy_white_200 ] ) , ( [ legge_densita_vento_omogeneo ] ) , we obtain : @xmath45 where @xmath46 . @xcite 
 analyzed the far - ultraviolet spectrum of o - type supergiants and found that clumping starts deep in the wind , just above the sonic point @xmath47 , at velocity @xmath48  km  s@xmath2 . in the cak model the sonic point is defined as the point where the wind velocity is equal to the sound speed ( @xmath49 ) : @xmath50 adopting typical parameters for o supergiants , from equation ( [ sonicpoint ] ) we obtain that the clumping phenomenon starts close to the photosphere ( @xmath51 ) . assuming spherical geometry for the clumps and that the mass of each clump is conserved , it is possible to obtain the expansion law of the clumps from equation ( [ legge_densita_clump ] ) , with @xmath52 : @xmath53^{1/3}\ ] ] from equation ( [ legge_rcl_r ] ) we find that the clump size increases with the distance from the supergiant star . 
 for the initial clump dimensions we tried two different distributions , a power law @xmath54 and a truncated gaussian function : @xmath55 where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is a free parameter .    for any given mass clump we derived the minimum and maximum values for the initial radii as follows . 
 the minimum radius is that below which the clump is optically thick for the uv resonance lines . in this case gravity 
 dominates over the radiative force causing the clump to fall back onto the supergiant . 
 the momentum equation of a radiatively driven clump is : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mass of the supergiant , @xmath60 is the radiative acceleration due to the continuum opacity by electron scattering , @xmath61 is the radiative acceleration due to line scattering . while equation ( [ cak_equation ] ) 
 is an approximation that ignores the pressure gradient , the solution of the momentum equation differs only slightly from the accurate solution derived by @xcite ; another assumption is that the photosphere has been treated as a point source @xcite . 
 the radiative acceleration due to electron scattering is : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the opacity for electron scattering , and is given by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the thomson cross section , @xmath66 is the number density of electrons , @xmath67 is the density of the clump and @xmath68 is the luminosity of the ob supergiant . 
 @xcite found @xmath69 . assuming a constant degree of ionization in the wind both @xmath63 and @xmath60 are constant . 
 the radiative acceleration due to the line scattering is : @xmath70 where @xmath71  @xmath72  g@xmath2 , @xmath30 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 are the force multiplier parameters , which are obtained with the calculation of the line radiative force @xcite . 
 @xmath75 is the dimensionless optical depth parameter @xcite . 
 according to the model of @xcite , we assume no velocity gradient inside the clump ( of size @xmath76 ) , then we utilize the dimensionless optical depth parameter for a static atmosphere @xmath77 . 
 @xmath78 is the geometrical dilution factor @xcite , given by : @xmath79\ ] ] according to the equation ( [ legge_densita_clump ] ) , we find that the number density of electrons in each clump is given by : @xmath80 where @xmath81 such that : @xmath82 from equation ( [ cak_equation ] ) we obtain that the minimum radius of the clump is given by : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the acceleration due to gravity . 
 approximating @xmath75 as @xmath85 and assuming the force multiplier parameters calculated by @xcite , with @xmath86  km  s@xmath2 and @xmath87 , we finally obtain the lower - limit for the clump radius : @xmath88 where : @xmath89 we found that for the interesting range of the clump masses , the drag force @xcite values are less than 3% of the forces resulting from equations ( [ radiative acceleration due to electron scattering ] ) and ( [ g_l ] ) . 
 thus , in the determination of the minimum clump radius , we can neglect this contribution . 
 the upper - limit to the clump radius is obtained from the definition of a clump as an over - density with respect to the inter - clump smooth wind :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the mass loss rate of the homogeneous wind component ( inter - clump ) . from equation ( [ rho_cl_max ] ) we obtain the upper - limit for the clump radius @xmath92 the lower and the upper limits for the clump radius ( equations [ r_cl_min ] and [ rho_cl_max ] ) depend on the supergiant parameter @xmath93 , @xmath68 , @xmath17 , @xmath16 , @xmath20 , @xmath91 . 
 thus supergiants of different spectral type have , for any given mass of the clump , different minimum and maximum values for the initial radii distribution . however , 
 these differences are smaller than a factor 10 for ob supergiants , and the intersection of the upper - limit and lower - limit functions ranges from @xmath94  g to @xmath95  g. 
 the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion theory [ @xcite ; @xcite ] is usually applied to the hmxbs where a ob supergiant loses mass in the form of a fast stellar wind , ( terminal velocity , @xmath96  km  s@xmath2 ) , that is assumed to be homogeneous and spherically symmetric . only matter within a distance smaller than the _ accretion radius _ ( @xmath97 ) is accreted : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the neutron star mass and @xmath100 is the relative velocity between the neutron star and the wind . 
 the fraction of stellar wind gravitationally captured by the neutron star is given by : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the density of the wind @xcite . 
 [ cols=""^,^,^,^ "" , ]     in table [ summary hmxbs ] we have summarized the wind parameters obtained for the 3 sources . 
 this table shows the typical differences in the mass - loss rate and terminal velocity expected from the cak theory , similar values for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and different values for @xmath105 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , which seem to be proportional to the inverse of the effective temperature of the supergiant . 
 moreover , we found that the values of @xmath11 that best reproduce the observed light curves of the 3 hmxbs studied , are in agreement with the hypothesis that the mass - loss rate derived by the h@xmath73 emission is overestimated by a factor 210 , in agreement with recent studies ( see section [ the effect of the mass - loss rate ] ) . 
 we can exclude that the observed light curves of the three hmxbs studied can be reproduced with the same set of wind parameters .    in conclusion , 
 the different values of @xmath105 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 obtained for the 3 hmxbs studied in this paper reveal that , in the framework of our clumpy wind model , the properties of the clumps of these 3 x  ray binary systems are slightly different , independently of the orbital period . 
 this discrepancy could be due to the different spectral type of the 3 supergiants , which could eject structurally inhomogeneus winds with slightly different properties . 
 we suggest as a possible cause of this behaviour that the values of @xmath105 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 could be related to the sonic radius where the clumps start @xcite , which depends on the supergiant properties ( equation [ sonicpoint ] ) .

 stars : supergiants .",in the framework of the clumpy wind model proposed by and proposed that what distinguishes the sfxts from the persistent hmxbs with supergiant companions is their different orbital separation in persistently bright sources the compact object orbits the companion at a small distance stellar radii where there is a high number density of clumps while the transient emission in sfxts is produced by accretion of much rarer clumps present at larger distances. however these differences are smaller than a factor 10 for ob supergiants and the intersection of the upper limit and lower limit functions ranges from g to g the bondi hoyle lyttleton accretion theory is usually applied to the hmxbs where a ob supergiant loses mass in the form of a fast stellar wind terminal velocity km s xmath2 that is assumed to be homogeneous and spherically symmetric. approximating as and assuming the force multiplier parameters calculated by with km s xmath2 and we finally obtain the lower limit for the clump radius where we found that for the interesting range of the clump masses the drag force values are less than 3 of the forces resulting from equations radiative acceleration due to electron scattering and g_l . in sections study of the hmxb vela x 1 study of the sgxb 4u 1700 377 and study of the sfxt igr j11215 5952 we compare the x ray light curves predicted with our model to the observations of three high mass x ray binaries showing that it is possible to reproduce well the observed flaring behaviors. the x ray variability observed in 4u 1700 xmath0377 vela x xmath01 and other hmxbs can be explained in terms of wind inhomogeneity and further indications for the presence of clumps come from x xmath0ray spectroscopy. moreover we found that the values of that best reproduce the observed light curves of the 3 hmxbs studied are in agreement with the hypothesis that the mass loss rate derived by the h xmath73 emission is overestimated by a factor 210 in agreement with recent studies see section the effect of the mass loss rate . is the geometrical dilution factor given by according to the equation legge_densita_clump we find that the number density of electrons in each clump is given by where such that from equation cak_equation we obtain that the minimum radius of the clump is given by where is the acceleration due to gravity. in conclusion the different values of obtained for the 3 hmxbs studied in this paper reveal that in the framework of our clumpy wind model the properties of the clumps of these 3 x ray binary systems are slightly different independently of the orbital period. these _ supergiant fast x xmath0ray transients _ sfxts are remarkably different from the classical high mass x ray binaries hmxbs with supergiant companions that are bright persistent sources and also differ from the be transients for their optical companions and shorter outbursts. for example the x xmath0ray spectrum of vela x xmath01 during the eclipse phase shows recombination lines produced by a hot ionized gas and fluorescent k shell lines produced by cool and dense gas of near neutral ions,0.3988995873452545,0.17103448275862068,0.19257221458046764
75,"it is convenient to split the problem of multiple populations in globular clusters ( gcs ) into two challenges or questions . 
 first , what is producing the chemical abundance anomalies giving rise to observable features such as the na - o anti - correlation and multiple sequences in the colour - magnitude diagrams of gcs ( e.g. gratton et al . 
 2012 , piotto et al . 
 2012 ) ? but another important challenge is to understand how this polluted material makes its way into a large fraction of the cluster stars ( the observed enriched fraction is @xmath0 today ; see e.g. bastian & lardo 2015 ) . whether it is through multiple generations of star formation ( e.g. dercole et al . 2008 ) , via accretion onto low - mass pre - main sequence stars born as part of the same burst of star formation ( bastian et al . 
 2013 ) , or via a yet unknown alternative process ( as suggested by bastian et al . 2015 ) , the mechanism by which enriched material is incorporated into stars will dictate the initial configuration of the enriched ( i.e. polluted ) stars compared to the primordial ( i.e. normal ) stars . 
 this will set the initial conditions for the long - term dynamical evolution of the cluster and its multiple populations , which is the focus of this contribution . 
 because gcs are collisional systems , their long - term dynamical evolution leads to two phenomena that can affect the present - day kinematics and spatial distribution of subpopulations : phase - space mixing and mass segregation . 
 due to two - body encounters , populations of stars with different initial phase - space distributions will exchange energy and angular momentum and gradually mix ( decressin et al . 2008 , vesperini et al . 
 2013 , hnault - brunet et al . 
 the trend towards kinetic energy equipartition also leads massive stars and remnants to slow down and sink towards the centre of the cluster , effectively pushing the lower - mass stars outwards . because the two - body relaxation timescale ( on which these processes become important ) 
 is inversely proportional to the local density ( e.g. spitzer 1987 ) , the importance of these processes will vary significantly between different regions of the cluster . in the outer regions , where the relaxation timescale is longer 
 , there will be less mixing and we may expect to still see imprints of the initial conditions and formation process . in the inner regions , 
 the shorter relaxation timescale leads to more mixing , potentially erasing any initial differences between subpopulations , and mass segregation can also proceed more efficiently and introduce differences in the spatial distribution and kinematics of different mass species . in the following sections , we review constraints on the formation of multiple populations imposed by their present - day kinematics and spatial distribution . 
 n - body simulations of clusters with two subpopulations starting spatially segregated and with comparable numbers of stars have shown that complete spatial mixing is expected when about @xmath1 of the initial mass of the cluster has been lost due to two - body relaxation ( vesperini et al . 
 this also applies to the distinct kinematics of different subpopulations , which will be erased on a similar timescale ( e.g. decressin et al . 
 2008 , hnault - brunet et al . 
 given their current mass and galactocentric radius , a large fraction of galactic gc are expected to still be expanding within their tidal radius and to have lost less than 50% of their initial mass by relaxation - driven evaporation ( gieles et al . 
 2011 ) , so some memory of the initial configuration of subpopulations should be preserved in the outer parts of many gcs . and 
 indeed , when looking at the spatial distribution of subpopulations in the outer regions of clusters ( from around the half - mass radius - @xmath2 - and beyond ) , a more centrally concentrated enriched population has been found in many clusters ( e.g. sollima et al . 
 2007 , bellini et al . 
 2009 , lardo et al . 
 2011 , milone et al . 
 2012 ) , suggesting that enriched stars formed more centrally concentrated . 
 that said , evidence for a fully mixed cluster has also been reported ( ngc 6362 ; dalessandro et al . 
 2014 ) and full mixing may be more common than previously thought ( vanderbeke et al . 2015 ; although see their caveats about using horizontal branch stars as tracers ) . 
 kinematic differences have been found in some cases in the outer regions of clusters , with the ( na ) enriched population having a lower velocity dispersion ( bellazzini et al . 
 2012 , kuinskas et al . 
 the more centrally concentrated population is generally expected to be dynamically cooler ( see e.g. bekki 2011 ; mastrobuono - battisti & perets 2013 ; hnault - brunet et al . 
 2015 ) , regardless of its initial configuration ( flattened disc - like or spherical subsystem ) , so again this is consistent with an enriched population that started more centrally concentrated . using hubble space telescope ( hst ) proper motions of stars near @xmath3 in 47 tuc , richer et al . 
 ( 2013 ) found that the presumably he - enriched stars ( bluer main - sequence stars ) have a more radially anisotropic velocity distribution .

 ( 2015 ) observed a similar behaviour for stars between @xmath4 and @xmath5 from hst proper motions in ngc 2808 , with stars coinciding with the presumably he - enchanced populations in the middle and blue main sequences showing a smaller tangential velocity dispersion than the populations corresponding to primordial stars , while no significant differences were found in the radial - velocity dispersion . 
 we showed in hnault - brunet et al . 
 ( 2015 ) that a more radially anisotropic velocity distribution for the polluted stars is also predicted if this population started more centrally concentrated and then diffused outward , and it is by no means a unique signature of any of the scenarios proposed . for example , whether gas collected into the core of the cluster to form a new generation of polluted stars ( possibly adopting a flattened initial distribution if the cluster had some net rotation ; e.g. dercole et al . 
 2008 , bekki 2010 ) , or if the polluted stars are the ones initially crossing the core of the cluster and preferentially on radial orbits ( e.g. as in the early disc accretion scenario of bastian et al . 2013 ) , any remaining present - day velocity anisotropy signature is expected to be very similar ( see fig . 
 [ fig1 ] ) .    ) as a function of radius ( in 3d ) for the polluted ( in blue ) and pristine ( i.e. primordial composition - in red ) stars as a function of time , for three different initial configurations : a spherical and isotropic subsystem of polluted stars embedded in a more extended spherical cluster ( model mgen0c - left ) , a flattened rotating subsystem of polluted stars embedded in a non - rotating spherical cluster ( model mgen1 - centre ) , a rotating cluster where the polluted stars are flagged as the ones with an orbit crossing the cluster core at @xmath6 ( model acc1 - right ) .

 all the observational evidence collected so far in the outer parts of gcs points to an enriched population forming more centrally concentrated , but this does not help to discard or favour any particular formation mechanism since all current scenarios either predict such a trend or were designed to match these observational constraints . to make progress , we need to identify unique imprints that would allow to distinguish between various scenarios . for example , mastrobuono - battisti & perets ( 2013 ) proposed to look for morphological features such as a larger flattening of the enriched population , which is a possible outcome of a scenario with multiple generations of stars ( although this may prove challenging to measure ) . 
 we recently suggested the differential rotation of subpopulations as a promising kinematic signature ( hnault - brunet et al . 
 2015 ) . given some net angular momentum initially , models for which a second generation forms from gas that collects in a cooling flow into the core of the cluster predict an initially larger rotational amplitude for the polluted stars compared to the primordial stars ( a consequence of angular momentum conservation ) . 
 hypothetically removing @xmath7 of first - generation stars ( in order to alleviate the  mass budget "" problem plaguing scenarios with multiple generations of star formation ) would also remove a large fraction of the angular momentum of the more extended primordial population ( see hnault - brunet et al . 
 the opposite trend is expected from a scenario in which the polluted stars are the ones initially crossing the core of the cluster ( e.g. bastian et al . 
 2013 ) and preferentially on radial ( low - angular momentum ) orbits . in this case 
 , the rotational amplitude of the polluted stars would be lower initially ( assuming the cluster has some net rotation ) . 
 this is illustrated in fig . 
 [ fig2 ] , where we also show that a differential rotation between the polluted and primordial stars of the order of 1  km  s@xmath8 or larger can remain in the outer parts of a cluster after a hubble time of dynamical evolution ( the simulations shown are scaled to match the properties of 47 tuc ) . 
 marginal evidence for differential rotation between subpopulations has been reported in a few clusters ( e.g. ngc 6441 and ngc 6388 ; bellazzini et al . 
 2012 ) , with polluted stars displaying a smaller rotational amplitude , but these are based on relatively small datasets and will need to be confirmed with more observations .    :

 larsen et al . ( 2015 ) found a surprising result when investigating the spatial distributions of subpopulations in m15 using hst / wfc3 photometry of red giants . 
 unlike what is typically observed in the outer regions of clusters ( including m15 ) , they found that the giants with primordial composition are more centrally concentrated in the inner parts of the cluster ( within the half - light radius ) . 
 they considered mass segregation as a possible culprit for the observed trend , but showed with @xmath9-body simulations that a significant mean mass difference would be needed , with primordial giants required to be @xmath10  m@xmath11 more massive than their enriched counterparts . 
 if interpreted as a difference in helium content , this mean mass difference would imply extreme he enhancement ( @xmath12 ) , which is clearly incompatible with the colour - magnitude diagram of m15 . 
 larsen et al . therefore concluded that the radial trends seen in m15 presumably reflect initial conditions , but we consider below another possibility . 
 a larger binary fraction has been inferred for primordial stars compared to enriched stars ( @xmath13 vs. @xmath14 ; dorazi et al . 
 2010 , lucatello et al . 2015 ) around the half - mass radii of gcs , in keeping with the idea that the enriched stars were born in a denser environment where ( loose ) binaries are more efficiently destroyed ( e.g. hong et al . 
 2015 ) . in the core of clusters , 
 the binary fraction can increase to be as high as @xmath15 ( e.g. hurley et al . 
 2007 ) , so this may account for the large mean mass difference needed to explain the results of larsen et al . 
 whether or not this can work in detail however remains to be shown , and it will depend on the complex interplay between many factors : the initial binary properties and spatial distribution of subpopulations , the rate of creation and disruption of binaries , the amount of dynamical evolution , the structure of the cluster . 
 studies of the spatial distribution of subpopulations in the central regions of other gcs should also help to clarify this picture , but we should keep in mind that the perceived effect of mass segregation on the distribution of different mass species will vary from cluster to cluster . for example , this effect would be stronger in more concentrated clusters like m15 in comparison to clusters with a very large core over half - light radius like ngc 2808 . 
 we illustrate this in fig . 
 [ fig3 ] by showing , for m15 and ngc 2808 , the mass density profile ( in 3d ) predicted for two tracer populations of evolved stars with a mean stellar mass differing by 0.25  m@xmath11 , when assuming a fully mass segregated cluster . 
 the underlying potential was constrained by fitting multi - mass models from gieles & zocchi ( 2015 ) to the surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of these clusters in order to model their mass distribution .     in gcs m15 and ngc 2808.,width=499 ] 
 we emphasised that observations of the kinematics and spatial distribution of multiple populations around the half - mass radius of gcs and beyond are consistent with the enriched population forming more centrally concentrated . 
 in contrast , the trend seen in the inner regions of m15 appears to clash with this interpretation and remains difficult to explain by mass segregation . 
 we speculated that a larger binary fraction for the primordial population in the centre of m15 may reconcile these findings . 
 we finally suggest possible future avenues to make progress in understanding the formation of multiple populations in gcs through their long - term kinematics and dynamics : ( 1 ) constrain any differential rotation of subpopulations , ( 2 ) quantify their central spatial distributions in a larger sample of gcs to compare with the puzzling results in m15 , and ( 3 ) measure the respective binary fractions of subpopulation in the central regions of clusters .","we discuss constraints on the formation of multiple populations in globular clusters ( gcs ) imposed by their present - day kinematics ( velocity dispersion and anisotropy ) and spatial distribution . 
 we argue that the observational evidence collected so far in the outer parts of clusters is generally consistent with an enriched population forming more centrally concentrated compared to the primordial population , in agreement with all the scenarios proposed to date ( in some cases by design ) , but not sufficient to favour a particular scenario . 
 we highlight that the differential rotation of subpopulations is a signature that may provide crucial new constraints and allow us to distinguish between various scenarios . 
 finally , we discuss the spatial distribution of subpopulations in the central regions of gcs and speculate that mass segregation between subpopulations may be due to a difference in their binary fraction .","we discuss constraints on the formation of multiple populations in globular clusters ( gcs ) imposed by their present - day kinematics ( velocity dispersion and anisotropy ) and spatial distribution .

76,"in most of the cosmological studies , dark matter particles are treated as collisionless particles . 
 for instance , to describe the cosmological density evolution , collisionless boltzmann equation is adopted . in cosmological n - body simulations , a group of collisionless dark matter particles , 
 are represented by a single collisionless particle in the computer from the coarse - grained point of view . in the treatment by the boltzmann equation , in which the distribution function is defined in a phase space , the particle mass and statistical weight 
 are explicitly dealt with , although the dark matter particles are still regarded as classical particles without interaction except for gravity . in the coarse - grained view adopted by n - body simulations , there is no particle information and only the global mass density distribution is obtained .    however , by adopting the assumption that dark matter particles are collisionless classical particles , we might have lost basic physics in some cases . at high number densities and relatively low temperature , low - mass elementary particles , experience quantum statistical degeneracy due to indistinguishability of identical particles . for instance 
 , it used to be well known that the neutrino black body in the early universe was partially degenerate @xcite . 
 neutrinos are fermions and the radiation pressure of the neutrino black body can be interpreted as the combination degeneracy pressure and thermal pressure . 
 as we discuss later in this paper , massive relic neutrinos are likely to remain partially degenerate , after decoupling and even after they become nonrelativistic under adiabatic expansion .    after nonlinear evolution of a high - density part of the universe 
 , we might see a high concentration of dark matter particles around the center of a cluster of galaxies . 
 if dark matter particles are composed at least partially of light fermions ( e.g. neutrinos ) , their degeneracy pressure may be large enough to support the density structure near the center of the cluster against gravity . 
 a self - gravitating system supported by degeneracy pressure of fermions , such as a white dwarf or a neutron star , is known to have a flat - top density profile . 
 this is our motivation to explore the possibility that recent results regarding the mass profiles of clusters of galaxies obtained by gravitational lensing @xcite might be explained by the degeneracy pressure of light fermionic dark matter particles .    in this paper , using a phenomenological equation of state ( eos ) that describes the physical conditions between fully degenerate fermionic gas and the classical ideal gas , we integrate the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , under the simple assumption that the local kinetic energy of a classical particle is equal to its gravitational energy determined by the 3d encircled mass . our model is expected to be valid only near the core of a cluster where dynamical equilibrium is possibly achieved . for pure fermions , 
 the volume density profile is uniquely determined by three parameters , the central density , @xmath0 , and the properties of dark matter particles , namely , the mass , @xmath1 , and statistical weight , @xmath2 . to compare our model with observations , we smoothly connect our model volume density profile describing the inner region to a volume density profile derived from the observed column density profile by assuming spherical symmetry at a radius near the einstein radius . in this way 
 our model column density profiles can be directly compared with strong lensing results . in reality 
 , there are baryons and possibly other forms of dark matter such as massive cold dark matter particles . 
 these general cases are dealt with by introducing another input parameter , the ratio of the total mass density and light fermion density , @xmath3 . 
 a1689 studied by @xcite is the best studied cluster by both strong and weak lensing , for which column density profile is obtained from the core to radii greater than 1 mpc . as a case study 
 , we apply our modeling to this cluster and constrain the possible combinations of particle properties . as a natural candidate for light fermions 
 , we consider the case of massive neutrinos . 
 the paper is organized as follows . 
 we first obtain the volume density of a1689 from the observed column density profile of @xcite and show that ev fermions can be degenerate near the core of this cluster in  2 . 
 our modeling procedure is described in  3 and the properties of input fermions are discussed in  4 , and then the results are presented in  5 . 
 the moderate degeneracy of unbound relic neutrinos and the plausibility that they can fall into the cluster core , are discussed in  6 . 
 recently broadhurst et al . 
 @xcite reported a mass column density profile of the cluster of galaxies , a1689 , obtained from gravitational lensing . 
 one of the important properties of the profile is that it has a flat top . 
 we propose that this flat - top column density profile might be explained by the effects of degeneracy pressure of fermionic dark matter . here 
 we analyze this proposal . 
 first we briefly introduce the main results of @xcite . in their analysis 
 , 1@xmath4 corresponds to 129 kpc @xmath5 . in @xcite , 
 the central 250 kpc @xmath5 in radius of multi - color hst / acs images were analyzed . 
 the mass column density profile , @xmath6 , is not expressed as a single power law of radius . 
 the mass column density profile flattens toward the center with a mean slope of + @xmath7 within @xmath8250 kpc @xmath5 . inside the einstein radius ( @xmath9 ) 
 , they obtained the slope of @xmath10 from the ratio between @xmath11 and the radius of the radial critical curve , @xmath12 . 
 they fit their results with an inner region of an nfw profile @xcite with a relatively high concentration , @xmath13 . 
 the mass column density , @xmath6 , is the integral of the volume density , @xmath14 , along the line of sight over the entire cluster scale of mpc . in order to study the possibility of fermion degeneracy near the center of the cluster , we need information on the volume density , @xmath14 , instead of the column density , @xmath6 . @xcite present the weak - lensing analysis of the wide field data obtained by subaru and obtained the column density profile at @xmath15 mpc @xmath5 . 
 they fit the combined profile of hst / acs and subaru with an nfw profile with a very high concentration , @xmath16 , significantly larger than theoretically expected value of @xmath17 . 
 they also fit the same observed column density profile with a power law profile with a core . 
 they give this result in terms of the angular radius dependence of the convergence , @xmath18 , as    @xmath19    @xmath20 and @xmath21 give the best fit although @xmath22 and @xmath21 are mutually dependent and a finite range of the combination ( @xmath22,@xmath23 ) gives equally good fits . in terms of @xmath24 and 
 the degrees of freedom , this core power law profile fits the observation better than the best - fit nfw profile and we use this profile for further discussion . 
 although @xcite do not claim so explicitly , the two facts that the best - fit nfw profile shows a much higher concentration than the value predicted by the cdm cosmology and the phenomenological profile , eq.([kappa ] ) , fits better than the best - fit nfw profile , may indicate some contradiction to the cdm cosmology . 
 we start our analysis from this core power - law profile , eq([kappa ] ) , for further discussion . 
 we convert ( [ kappa ] ) to a column density profile , @xmath6 , in physical units of length and mass using the relations , @xmath25 , @xmath26 0.95 @xmath27 , and the normalization of 2d encircled mass inside the einstein radius , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . 
 the result is expressed as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 
 kpc @xmath5 corresponds to @xmath32 , the value used in @xcite . 
 the 2d encircled mass , @xmath33 , is analytically obtained and @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively for @xmath36 and @xmath37 . 
 therefore a high concentration of the mass is expected on the scale of @xmath28 . by assuming spherical symmetry , we wish to obtain the volume density @xmath14 by solving    @xmath38    instead using a standard method like the abel transform 
 , we assumed another power - law profile with a core radius for @xmath14 and obtained the best fit parameters , to see the changes of the core radius and the power law index . from now on , 
 we fix @xmath39 @xcite , so that direct comparison between observations and models can be made . 
 the range of integration in @xmath40 is from @xmath411.4mpc to @xmath421.4mpc , which correspond to the region with good weak lensing signals , since we need solid numbers on the scale of cluster core . 
 the result is    @xmath43    the best fit parameters somewhat depends on the range of integration . 
 for instance , if we use the observed column density profile eq.([cpl ] ) out to @xmath442.8 mpc , regardless of the strength of weak lensing signals , the core radius in units of @xmath28 , and power - law index , change to 1.25 , and -3.71 , respectively . note that the power - law index of our choice , -3.41 , is closer to that of an nfw profile of -3 , than -3.71 . 
 since our interest is in the inner region as we show later , and since the contribution of the outer region to the total mass is small , our choice should be justified . 
 before proceeding to modeling of mass profiles , we first show that at the center of a1689 with volume densities of order of @xmath45 ( g@xmath46@xmath47 ) , nonrelativistic ev - mass fermions can become degenerate . 
 since a mass of 1 ev corresponds to @xmath48 g , the number density , @xmath49 @xmath47 , and the mean inter - particle spacing is , @xmath50 cm . on the other hand , 
 the de broglie wavelength for a 1 ev particle with a relative velocity @xmath51 is , @xmath52 cm . 
 therefore for nonrelativistic particles with @xmath53 , the condition for high degeneracy , @xmath54 , is satisfied . 
 we first formulate the modeling procedure of matter distribution for the case that the entire matter consists purely of fermionic dark matter and then , modify the formulation for the case that the fractional contribution of fermionic dark matter density to the total matter density is constant . 
 first we provide our justification for introducing an equation of state and assuming hydrostatic equilibrium for the mixture of degenerate fermions and non - degenerate classical collisionless particles . a self - gravitating system composed purely of classical collisionless particles such as cold dark matter particles 
 may be thermodynamically anomalous @xcite and the equation of state may be poorly defined . 
 however , the effect of fermion degeneracy or introduction of repulsion due to pauli s exclusion principle is to make the mixture of degenerate fermions and classical collisionless particles a thermodynamically normal system and an analysis based on hydrostatic equilibrium valid .    to deal with the general situations in which particle temperature is finite and degeneracy is partial , we need to know the equation of state ( eos ) , and have to determine the temperature profile along with the density profile . 
 we adopt two major assumptions that simplify our analysis of fermionic dark matter distribution . 
 first , we assume that the eos , or the pressure law , has the following form ,    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the zero temperature degeneracy pressure given by    @xmath57    @xmath23 is the number density and @xmath58 is the thermal pressure of the classical ideal gas . 
 eq.([peos ] ) can be rewritten as ,    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the fermi level given by    @xmath61    and @xmath62 corresponds to the degree of degeneracy . 
 the formulae for degeneracy pressure and fermi level , eqs.([pd],[ef ] ) , are derived in a textbook of statistical physics @xcite . 
 this eos , eq([peos ] ) , has been used , for example , in an analytic model of the brown dwarf interior where electrons are expected to be partially degenerate @xcite . the approximation used in this eos may be crude for intermediate degeneracy . 
 the second assumption is with regard to classical kinetic energy . 
 collisionless particles in general may not be in local thermodynamic equilibrium at a given radius , @xmath63 . as we have mentioned before , the classical thermal pressure term in eq([peos ] ) for collisionless particles is actually the pressure equivalent , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the velocity dispersion in the static jeans equation with an isotropic velocity dispersion @xcite . 
 physically quantum statistical degeneracy will be dissolved by classical kinetic energy , or velocity dispersion , @xmath65 , as @xmath65 increases . here 
 we further assume that the particle kinetic energy at @xmath63 , is in balance with the gravitational energy induced by the 3d encircled mass interior to @xmath63 . from this assumption , 
 we obtain ,    @xmath66    where    @xmath67    from eqs.([peos],[assumption2 ] ) , we obtain the expression for the pressure ,    @xmath68      for ordinary gas , the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( ehse ) describes the dynamical equilibrium . for collisionless particles , 
 its counterpart is the static jeans equation with an isotropic velocity dispersion @xcite . in the pressure law , 
 eq([plaw ] ) , the first term is the gas pressure of degenerate fermions , while the second term is the pressure equivalent of collisionless non - degenerate particles . 
 since , the ehse and isotropic jeans equation exactly have the same mathematical form , eq([plaw ] ) can be inserted to the ehse ,    @xmath69    below we give a brief description of how to integrate eq([hse ] ) . 
 first , we define @xmath70 by    @xmath71    or in its differential form ,    @xmath72    @xmath70 is the 3d encircled particle number divided by @xmath73 and satisfies a boundary condition that @xmath74 . 
 eq([hse ] ) is reduced to    @xmath75}{\left[a r^2 n(r)^{2/3 } + 2 r n(r)\right ] } , \label{dndr}\ ] ]    where    @xmath76    which has the dimension of length . 
 even with double precision , the dynamic range is too large for cgs units , to deal with cluster scale quantities . 
 we adopt kpc as the units of length . in this case , @xmath77 . 
 parameters that determine a solution are the central number density @xmath78 , which is positive and finite , and particle properties , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . 
 integration of eqs.([dndr],[dndr ] ) is performed simultaneously , using the fourth - order runge - kutta method . 
 so far we have dealt with the case that the mass density is purely due to fermionic dark matter . in reality , 
 light fermions may account for a limited fraction of entire dark matter . 
 moreover , the baryon - to - dark - matter ratio is about 1:5 on average for the entire universe , and we have to take into account the baryon contribution . 
 since we have no reliable information on the radial dependence of @xmath79 near the cluster center , we assume a constant @xmath3 . by incorporating @xmath3 into eq([hse ] ) , 
 eq.([dndr ] ) is modified as    @xmath80}{\left[a r^2 n(r)^{2/3 } + 2 \delta^2 r n(r)\right]}. \label{dndr2}\ ] ]    later we also consider the case that @xmath3 depends on @xmath63 due to the contribution of a massive galaxy placed at the center to see how much model parameters are affected by the presence of a galaxy . 
 since the asymptotic form of the phenomenological eos is that of classical ideal gas , a model profile approaches to an isothermal profile or @xmath81 at large @xmath63 , which does not approximate the behavior of the observed core - power - law profile at large @xmath63 ( @xmath82 ) . 
 the same is true for an nfw profile @xcite for which @xmath83 at large @xmath63 . 
 so the validity of the model is limited to the core of the cluster for which @xmath84 . 
 therefore we can not compare our models directly with the column density profile obtained by @xcite , since we can not integrate a model volume density profile along an entire line of sight . on the other hand , 
 the most robust observable obtained from strong gravitational lensing is the 2d encircled mass within the einstein radius , @xmath85 , which gives the best constraint on the model . 
 the second best observable is the power - law slope of the column density profile between the radial and tangential critical curves . 
 these two quantities are taken into account in deriving the observed density profile , but again should be taken into account in the comparison with the model as well . in any case , it is best to compare our models with the observed column density profile out to @xmath84 . 
 we construct a hybrid column density profile by smoothly connecting a model volume density profile with the observed volume density profile at a transition radius @xmath86 . 
 the actual procedure is that the radius , @xmath86 , is searched for at which both @xmath87 and @xmath88 are connected . 
 this condition is physically justified below . 
 we derive a model profile under the assumption of the hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) . in order for hse to hold also at @xmath86 , the pressure gradient 
 , @xmath89 needs to be connected as well as @xmath90 . 
 if the eos has the form that the pressure @xmath91 is given as an analytic function of @xmath90 as    @xmath92    its derivative is    @xmath93    therefore the continuity of @xmath89 is equivalent to that of @xmath94 under the condition that @xmath90 is continuous . 
 since the 3d encircled mass is the volume integral of @xmath14 , the ehse becomes a differential equation of second order , when the pressure is given as eq.([normaleos ] ) . 
 this is the mathematical justification for both @xmath90 and @xmath94 to be connected . 
 our phenomenological eos is of course analytic . 
 the observed profile is given as @xmath14 , but the validity of ehse is not guaranteed for entire @xmath63 of the cluster , since the behavior of @xmath95 or that of the velocity dispersion @xmath96 is unknown . 
 however in the inner region of our interest , the ehse is expected to hold , as long as our model describes the actual physical situation . 
 the computation in practice is implemented as follows . 
 . give ( @xmath97 ) as input parameters . 
 set the initial transition radius @xmath86 to 0.5@xmath28 = 66.4 kpc . 
 since the location of the radial critical curve at 0.38@xmath28 , there is not strong observational constraint inside 0.5@xmath28 . in terms of the observed 2d encircled mass , @xmath98 , is only 34% of the robust observable , @xmath85 . 
 adjust @xmath0 iteratively so that the agreement of the model and observed @xmath90s at @xmath86 is good to 5% . 
 increase @xmath86 gradually until the matching of the model and observed @xmath94s becomes better than 5% , while @xmath0 is continually adjusted so that the connection of @xmath87 is maintained . 
 if the connection is found , the model and observed 2d encircled masses within @xmath28 , @xmath85s are compared . 
 when the agreement of the two encircled masses is found to be good to 2% , we accept this solution . 
 since the size of a self - gravitating degenerate star depends strongly on the particle mass as @xmath99 @xcite , the allowed range of the particle mass is restricted to the order of ev , if the degeneracy pressure is significant only near the flat - top cluster core , whose size is order of 100 kpc . 
 this order estimation later turns out to be correct , since solutions were found only for a narrow mass range near 1 ev . below we examine the possible ranges of statistical weight , @xmath2 , of fermions , and the fraction of the fermion density to the entire dark matter density .      from susy 
 , each known boson is expected to have a fermionic superpartner . 
 susy also predicts the stability of a lightest supersymmetric particle , probably the photino . 
 however , the lack of experimental detection at energy scales less than 10 gev , indicates that photinos are massive and are more of a candidate for cold dark matter @xcite . 
 since there is no candidate predicted to exist theoretically , we simply consider the case for a particle with spin 1/2 and assume that entire dark matter consists of these unknown fermions . from the spin degrees of freedom , 
 there are two possibilities , @xmath100 ( majorana fermion ) , or @xmath101 ( dirac fermion ) . 
 another possibility is that statistically independent particles and anti - particles equally contribute to the number density . 
 this gives effective @xmath101 ( majorana fermion ) and @xmath102 ( dirac fermion ) . 
 the most natural candidate for which its presence is well known is massive neutrinos . due to the small mass differences ( @xmath103 ev ) among the three species 
 , they must have a similar mass ( degenerate hierarchy ) , if the approximate particle mass is as large as 1 ev . 
 neutrinos and anti - neutrinos are considered as distinguishable particles and the mean number densities of relics particles are the same 
 . it will be natural to assume that the same ratio is maintained in the cluster core , since there is no physical cause for segregation . 
 in terms of the effective statistical weight for the three neutrino species , @xmath104 both for majorana and dirac neutrinos as long as we consider light relic neutrinos . although a dirac particle has two helicity states , only right - handed particles were populated in the thermal equilibrium of the early universe and the current number density of left - handed particles are expected to be negligible @xcite .    the current number density of each neutrino species ( particles and anti - particles ) regardless of majorana or dirac neutrinos , 
 is estimated to be 112.6 @xmath47 . if we adopt the cosmological parameters from three - year wmap observations @xcite , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , where dm and b stand for dark matter and baryons respectively . 
 the mean mass density of the three species of neutrinos with the approximate mass , @xmath1 ev , is @xmath109 g @xmath47 , while the present critical density of the universe is @xmath110 g @xmath47 . 
 then , the neutrino mass fraction to the critical density , @xmath111 , is given by ,    @xmath112    near the cluster center , @xmath113 , can be higher than the average value due to the dissipative collapse of baryons . since @xmath114 at the cluster center is unknown , 
 we adopt the cosmic average , @xmath115 , and to investigate how the change of @xmath114 affects model parameters , we also model the case for @xmath116 . 
 the spatial distribution of the cold dark matter and light neutrinos may also be different , if neutrino distribution is controlled by degeneracy pressure , while cdm particles behave as classical collisionless particles . 
 this effect is neglected for our initial attempt and the @xmath117 is fixed to the cosmic value , @xmath118 . with these assumptions , the total mass density to neutrino mass density , @xmath3 , 
 is related to @xmath114 as ,    @xmath119      although the total mass of galaxies in the cluster will be a small fraction of the total mass of the cluster , a massive galaxy can affect the local mass density significantly . to study the influence of a massive galaxy on model parameters , 
 we add a toy galaxy placed at the center to the particle density and solve ehse , and compare the result with that without this hypothetical galaxy .    for simplicity , the density profile of this galaxy is assumed to be given by a 3d gaussian as ,    @xmath120    where    @xmath121    where @xmath122 is the mass of the galaxy and @xmath123 is the gaussian scale length . in modeling 
 , @xmath3 is no longer a constant and depends on @xmath63 as ,    @xmath124 
 successful solutions are listed in table [ fermion.table ] . 
 the general trend is that for the same @xmath2 , the smaller the particle mass , @xmath1 , the larger the transition radius , @xmath86 . 
 if we measure the significance of a model by the radial coverage , which also corresponds the largest encircled mass coverage , the smallest @xmath1 solution is the most important for a given @xmath2 . for the smallest mass solutions , the range of particle mass is @xmath125 ev for @xmath126 for the cosmic baryon - dm ratio of 0.2 . 
 a larger baryon fraction reduces the particle mass . for the smallest @xmath1 solutions , resultant volume- and column density profiles 
 are almost identical as shown in figs.[fermion.rho ] and [ fermion.sigma ] . 
 there are some deficiencies of mass densities inside the location of the radial critical curve , @xmath127 . 
 however , in 3d and 2d encircled mass profiles shown in figs.[fermion.m3 ] and [ fermion.m2 ] , these mass deficiencies , which amount to at most 2% of the 3d encircled mass inside @xmath28 ( @xmath128 ) , are not noticeable . 
 the maximum allowed particle mass , @xmath1 , is obtained by equating @xmath111 and @xmath129 as 3.27 ev . 
 as can be seen in table [ neutrino.table ] , successful solutions have smaller particle masses . 
 therefore we are dealing with the cases that dark matter consists of neutrinos and another form of particles , possibly , nondegenerate cold dark matter particles . the volume and column density profiles are given in figs.[neu.rho ] and [ neu.sigma ] respectively . again 
 the model profiles are always lower than the observed profile near the center . however , the discrepancy between the models and observation is negligible in the linear plots of the encircled masses shown in figs.[neu.m3 ] and [ neu.m2 ] . 
 although @xmath1 depends on the baryon - dm ratio , @xmath114 , the resultant profiles are essentially identical and they are not distinguishable from the general fermion cases . for @xmath115 and 0.5 , the smallest mass solutions are for @xmath130 and 1.1 ev respectively . 
 it is typical to have a small fraction ( @xmath1312% ) of deficiency in the model 3d encircled mass inside @xmath28 ( 1.06@xmath132 ) . 
 a brightest cluster galaxy at the center of a cluster , typically has a stellar mass in excess of @xmath133 and a 2% deficiency may be accounted for by a single massive galaxy at the center . 
 since the mass profile obtained by @xcite includes the contribution of galaxies , we should at least examine the possible effect to our models dealing solely with particles . 
 our toy galaxy has a total mass of @xmath134 and a gaussian volume profile with the scale length of 20 kpc . 
 we did not perform any fitting or adjustment of the galaxy model parameters , except that the total mass corresponds to the 3d encircled mass deficiency with respect to the observed value . 
 it turned out that this toy galaxy had no effect on the particle mass , @xmath1 , although the ehse was solved from the origin as usual . on the other hand , as can be seen in the volume- and column densities in figs.[neu.rho ] and [ neu.sigma ] , the model galaxy remedies the local mass deficiency problem at the center . in fig.[neu.efek ] , the fermi levels @xmath135 and classical kinetic energies @xmath136 are plotted for the models without and with the toy galaxy . 
 the toy galaxy acts as an external gravity source , whose effect on the 3d encircled mass is largest near the center . 
 the gravity of the galaxy enhances the classical kinetic energy of a particle and dissolves the degeneracy . 
 this is the reason why there is a dip of the fermi level in the model with the galaxy . in other words , 
 the eos is softened locally by the stellar mass of the galaxy . 
 it should be emphasized that this is true only if the galaxy is given as an external mass source unaffected by the dark matter distribution . 
 also this effect is pronounced only near the origin of spherical symmetry , where the fractional contribution of the galaxy to the 3d encircled mass is the greatest . 
 one may wonder how fermions at the cluster center could be degenerate . here 
 we first point out the fact that even relic neutrinos are moderately degenerate , which used to be well known @xcite , but appears to be forgotten lately . 
 there is a clear distinction between the black body of fermions and that of bosons . while the range of values of the fermi distribution function for one - particle state is between 0 and 1 , that of the bose distribution function is between 0 and @xmath137 . 
 so the fermion black body is partially degenerate , while the boson black body is not . here 
 we calculate the degree of degeneracy for relic neutrinos immediately after decoupling and that after they become nonrelativistic , under the assumption of adiabatic expansion . 
 the current cosmology assumes that there are the equal numbers of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos for each species . 
 so the present number density of each quantum statistically independent species , @xmath138 , is 112.6/2 = 56.3 @xmath47 . at redshift @xmath40 , 
 the number density @xmath139 is given by    @xmath140    immediately after neutrino decoupling , when neutrinos were extremely relativistic , the fermi level , @xmath60 is given by    @xmath141^{1/3 } = 2.94 \times 10^{-4 } ( 1+z)\hskip 2 cm ( { \rm ev}).\ ] ]    on the other hand , the neutrino temperature then was    @xmath142    therefore the degree of degeneracy is given by    @xmath143    which indicates moderate degeneracy . 
 under adiabatic expansion , this degree of degeneracy is unlikely to change , while neutrinos are relativistic . 
 there is a transition from the relativistic to nonrelativistic regime when @xmath144 .    below    @xmath145    or at @xmath146 , where @xmath1 is units of ev , neutrinos become nonrelativistic . 
 then the expressions for both fermi level and neutrino temperature change , but they have the same dependence on @xmath147 . 
 as long as local gravity is negligible , nonrelativistic adiabatic expansion is assumed below @xmath148 ,    @xmath149^{2/3 } =   4.3\times10^{-8 } m^{-1 } ( 1+z)^2\hskip 2 cm ( { \rm ev}),\ ] ]    and    @xmath150    or    @xmath151    so the degree of degeneracy is    @xmath152    note that there is an offset of the zero point between the relativistic and nonrelativistic fermi levels given by @xmath153 , where the offset is negligible when particles are extremely relativistic . 
 again in the nonrelativistic regime , relic neutrinos are expected to be moderately degenerate . due to the change of dispersion relation of individual particles caused by the relativistic - to - nonrelativistic transition , the degree of degeneracy changes slightly , but this effect appears minor . 
 next we compare the kinetic energy level of bound neutrinos in the cluster and that of unbound neutrinos to see if relic neutrinos are cold enough so that they can fall to the cluster . 
 the fermi level and gravitationally induced kinetic energy at the cluster core are of @xmath154 ev or above as seen in fig.[neu.efek ] . on the other hand , unbound relic neutrinos which undergo adiabatic expansion 
 have the temperature given by eq([tnonrela ] ) . 
 for a1689 at @xmath155 and for @xmath156 ev , the kinetic energy of unbound relics will be @xmath157 ev , which is well below the energy level of the particles in the cluster core . 
 so it is possible that the relic neutrinos can fall into the cluster core . 
 the cluster also has hot plasma , which may affect the fermion degeneracy . 
 here we briefly argue that the effect of hot plasma will be minor . 
 first of all , hot plasma and neutrinos ( or weakly interacting fermions in general ) interact only through gravity and the plasma temperature has nothing to do with the velocity dispersion of neutrinos , which is determined by the encircles mass at a given @xmath63 . 
 what matters is the plasma s contribution to the encircled mass ( or encircled gravitational energy if the plasma is relativistic ) . the ratio of gas mass and total mass has been estimated to be about 7% by x - ray observations 
 they interact with fermions only through newtonian gravity , because the plasma is not hot enough to be relativistic or the kinetic energy of a plasma particle is negligible compared to the rest - mass energy . therefore unless the plasma particles have exceptionally high concentration near the 3d center of the cluster , their effect on the encircled mass should be minor compared to that by the dark matter particles . however , an extreme high concentration is not expected unless the plasma temperature profile has a singularity near the center . 
 since the x - ray emission is integrated along the light of sight , x - ray observations alone will not be capable of pin - pointing the plasma temperature near the 3d center of the cluster . 
 this degenerate fermion / neutrino hypothesis should be tested observationally with future - coming density profiles of other clusters obtained by gravitational lensing . 
 those profiles should be modeled by the fixed set of particle properties , @xmath158 , and by a varied set of the central density , @xmath0 . 
 modeling multiple cluster profiles may further constrain the particle properties . 
 there may be a room for improvement in the phenomenological equation of state ( peos ) . 
 the peos used in this paper , eq([peos ] ) , overestimates the degeneracy pressure , @xmath56 , since @xmath56 here is the zero - temperature degeneracy pressure for a given number density , @xmath23 , regardless of the temperature of fermions or regardless of the degree of degeneracy . 
 for the same observed density profile , the best - fit model with a more realistic peos will require a higher number density , @xmath23 , or a lower particle mass . 
 another possible improvement is that without fixing the density ratio of total matter and light fermions , the densities of light fermions and collisionless cold dark matter particles can be treated separately in terms of the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for the former and the jean equation for the latter , while they are coupled through the total encircled mass and the common velocity dispersion at a given @xmath63 . 
 one cosmological subject related particularity to the degeneracy of relic massive neutrinos , is its potential effect on `` free streaming '' . 
 relic neutrinos are hot dark matter , which were relativistic , when they decoupled . from the picture of completely collisionless particles , it is considered that small - scale fluctuations in the primordial neutrino density fluctuation spectrum should have been wiped out . 
 however , the partial degeneracy of relic neutrinos implies that not all of them could have behaved as free particles . 
 it is conceivable that the effect of fermi - dirac degeneracy is to suppress the `` free streaming '' or to preserve the initial fluctuation spectrum . 
 depending on the degree of this `` free - streaming suppression '' of neutrinos or fermionic hot dark matter in general , our expectation on the initial density fluctuation spectrum may need to be revised . 
 we plan to investigate this potential effect quantitatively in the near future . 
 in this paper , we have shown that the observed mass profile at the center of the cluster of galaxies , a1689 , is reproduced by models assuming the presence of degenerate fermionic dark matter . in the case that previously unknown fermions with spin 1/2 dominate the dark matter , the acceptable particle mass range is between 2 and 4 ev . in the case that the dark matter consists of the mixture of the degenerate relic neutrinos and classical collisionless cold dark matter particles , the mass range of neutrinos is between 1 and 2 ev , if the ratio of the two kinds of dark matter particles is fixed to its cosmic value . 
 both the pure fermionic dark matter models and neutrino - cdm - mixture models reproduce the observations equally well .

77,"despite considerable progress obtained over the last century , astrophysicists are still far away from a thorough understanding on how magnetic fields are produced in the sun and other cool active stars ; the picture gets even worse when it comes to explain quantitatively how these fields generate the plethora of active phenomena observed both at their surface ( e.g.  dark spots ) and in their immediate surrounding ( e.g.  corona , wind ) . particularly interesting in this respect is the case of fully convective stars for which conventional dynamo processes ( supposed to concentrate mostly in the interface layer between the radiative interior and the convective envelope , i.e.  the only place where the field can be stored for a time comparable to the period of the activity cycle ) can not be invoked to justify , not only the presence of a large - scale magnetic field ( e.g.  johns - krull & valenti 1996 ) , but also their very intense activity level . 
 the most recent observational results in this field , consisting of temporal series of magnetic maps obtained by indirect tomographic imaging from sets of rotationally modulated spectropolarimetric data ( donati et al . 
 1992 ; donati & cameron 1997 ; donati 1999 ; donati et al .  1999 ; donati et al .  2003 ; petit et al .  2003a , 2003b ) , are particularly intriguing and thus potentially very fruitful for providing new clues to what may be happening in the convective layers of these stars . 
 all reconstructed magnetic maps to date indeed show the presence of large magnetic regions in the stellar photosphere where the field is mostly azimuthal ( i.e.  parallel to the surface and oriented along parallels ) ; moreover , these regions are often observed to form partial , or even complete , rings of azimuthal field encircling the star at various latitudes , and are thus interpreted as the direct detection , at photospheric level , of the quasi - axisymmetric toroidal component of the large - scale dynamo field . 
 these results suggest in particular that dynamos operating in very active stars are likely to be significantly different than that of the sun . 
 the observations indeed reveal that such dynamos are able to produce large scale field ( and especially toroidal field ) very close to the surface ( since we would not observe toroidal field in the photosphere otherwise ) , and presumably even throughout the whole convective zone ; dynamo processes in these stars are therefore likely distributed within the convective envelope , rather than being confined at its base as in the sun . 
 this conclusion raises however a number of subsequent , and yet unresolved , problems ; we can no longer understand , for instance , how the magnetic field can be stored within the convective zone for periods of time as long as decades . at the same time 
 , it may provide new insight for a number of long standing mysteries , and in particular for our comprehension on how dynamos operate in fully convective stars . 
 one of these mysteries concerns the long - term fluctuations observed in the orbital period of close binary stars in which one member is at least a cool active star ( e.g.  hall 1990 ) , and occurring on a time scale of a few decades , i.e.  much shorter than what would be required for tidal coupling between system components to operate ( zahn 1989 ) . 
 the least unreasonable interpretation for this phenomenon remains that proposed by applegate ( 1992 ) ; he suggests that dynamo processes at work in one star of the binary system activate a periodic exchange between magnetic and kinetic energy within the convective zone of this star , and thus a cyclic fluctuation of its quadrupolar moment as well as of its gravitational field . 
 given the amplitude of the observed fluctuations in orbital period , one can easily infer that such magnetic to kinetic energy exchanges specific to dynamo processes must occur throughout the whole convective zone and not only within a thin layer ( lanza et al . 
 1998 ; donati 1999 ) , i.e.  that dynamo processes in these stars should indeed be distributed . 
 if applegate s ( 1992 ) idea is true , it therefore implies that very active stars such as those found in close binary stars , but also young single stars that did not dissipate most of their angular momentum yet and still exhibit very energetic active phenomena , should feature a convective zone that globally undergoes such periodic exchanges between magnetic and kinetic energy . 
 it means in particular that the internal velocity field within the convective zone of very active stars , and therefore both their radial and surface differential rotation profiles , should vary with time in a way correlated to the magnetic cycle . detecting such variations in the differential rotation of active stars 
 thus appears as a very interesting observational challenge , as it would provide a definite confirmation of both applegate s ( 1992 ) mechanism and of the existence of distributed dynamos . 
 it would also bring into a much wider astrophysical context the recent discovery that the solar angular rotation at the base of the convective zone is undergoing temporal fluctuations ( howe et al . 
 2000 ) as a probable consequence of the activity cycle .    measuring surface differential rotation of very active stars is however a rather tricky task ; detecting changes of this differential rotation is even more difficult . 
 several methods have been proposed to estimate surface differential rotation . 
 some of them try to make use of the subtle changes that differential rotation induce in the profile of spectral lines ( brunning 1981 ; reiners & schmitt 2002 ) ; this method can however not be used for the stars we are interested in , the spectral lines of which being heavily distorted by the presence of cool spots at their surfaces . 
 other methods ( e.g.  donati & cameron 1997 ) propose to take advantage of these surface features , and use them as tracers to derive some information on how their rotation periods depend on latitude . 
 the most recent of such techniques , that of cameron et al . 
 ( 2002 ) , succeeded , not only in estimating surface differential rotation of one active star , but also in suggesting that temporal changes in the amount of differential rotation were indeed occurring in this star ( cameron & donati 2002 ) .    in this paper , we propose to make use of yet another technique , first proposed by donati et al . 
 ( 2000 ) to estimate the differential rotation of a young pre - main - sequence star , then by petit et al . 
 ( 2002 , 2003a , b ) both for simulation purposes and application to spectropolarimetric data . 
 the aim of this paper is to apply this method to the extensive spectropolarimetric data set that we collected in the last seven yr for three stars , namely the young ultra - fast rotator ab  doradus , the young k0 star lq  hydrae and the k1 subgiant of the rs  cvn system hr  1099 , and from which yearly brightness and magnetic maps were obtained and published in the literature ( donati & cameron 1997 ; donati 1999 ; donati et al .  1999 , 2003 ) . 
 in sect .  [ sect : modelling ] , we recall the main aspects of both observational material and modelling tool , then describe its application to the three selected stars in sect .  [ 
 sect : diffrot ] ; after discussing at length the implication of our results for the understanding of the global dynamics of convective zones of cool stars ( in sect .  [ 
 sect : discussion ] ) , we finally conclude and propose in sect .  [ 
 sect : conclusion ] a few directions in which this work could be fruitfully extended . 
 the data we use are the spectropolarimetric observations collected at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) with a visitor polarimeter mounted at cassegrain focus and fibre linked to the high resolution ucl echelle spectrograph ( ucles ) . 
 this material , and in particular the observing logs , the observing procedures and the data reduction details , are described extensively in a series of published papers that present the results obtained up to now ( donati et al . 
 1997 ; donati & cameron 1997 ; donati 1999 ; donati et al .  1999 , 2003 ) . 
 the data we use in this paper are all observations of ab  dor , lq  hya and hr  1099 collected since epoch 1995.9 , i.e.  obtained in a similar spectrograph configuration . 
 this makes a maximum amount of 7 data sets ( corresponding to epochs 1995.94 , 1996.99 , 1998.03 , 1999.00 , 1999.97 , 2000.93 and 2001.99 ) for each of the three stars ; we however anticipate that several of them ( and in particular those with very few data or collected over a timespan of no more than a few days , e.g.  those at epoch 1999.97 ) will be unusable for our purpose , according to the conclusions of petit et al . 
 note that all data were reprocessed with the newest version of the reduction software ( donati et al . 
 2003 ) to ensure the highest possible internal accuracy in radial velocity as well as the best level of homogeneity . 
 all data were run through least - squares deconvolution ( lsd ) , a multiline tool developed by donati et al . 
 ( 1997 ) found to extract successfully the average rotationally broadened shape of unpolarised or circularly polarised lines ( called stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 lsd profiles in the following ) at each observed phase of the stellar rotational cycle , from the thousands of moderate to strong spectral features present in the recorded wavelength domain . 
 as mentioned earlier , the method we chose to estimate surface differential rotation for the selected stars is that introduced by donati et al . 
 ( 2000 ) , the validity of which was confirmed through an extensive sets of simulations by petit et al . 
 recently , petit et al .  ( 2003a , 
 b ) applied it successfully to large data sets collected over several years on a different telescope and with a different ( though similar ) instrumentation for two different stars , one of them being our third object of interest ( the k1 subgiant of hr  1099 ) and the other a giant star of fk  com type ( hd  199178 ) . 
 this method consists in assuming a given surface differential rotation law ( that we implement in our indirect stellar surface imaging code ) and producing brightness or magnetic images of the stellar surface from all unpolarised or circularly polarised data available for this star at a given season ; we then take as most probable the differential rotation law that generates the images with lowest information content ( given a certain data fit accuracy ) , or equivalently the images that provide the best fit to the data ( given a certain image information content ) . in practice , 
 both options yield very similar results ; the second one happens to be more convenient as it provides an easy way of estimating error bars on the differential rotation parameters ( see petit et al . 
 2002 ) . 
 the stellar surface imaging code that we use is that of brown et al . 
 ( 1991 ) and donati & brown ( 1997 ) , applied quite extensively to real data in the last decade ( the latest examples being donati et al . 
 2003 and petit et al . 
 2003a , b ) . 
 it includes in particular the possibility of reconstructing images of stars that are differentially rotating , i.e.  of taking into account explicitly the differential rotation pattern in the imaging process . 
 the surface differential rotation law we assume in this paper is given by the following equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the rotation rate at colatitude @xmath4 ,  the rotation rate of the equator and  the difference in rotation rate between the pole and equator . 
 at each season , one brightness and one magnetic image is produced from the full stokes @xmath0 and stokes @xmath1 data sets respectively , for each selected pair of differential rotation parameters within a reasonable search domain of the   plane . 
 this typically means that we have to compute a few hundred brightness and magnetic images for each star at each season , which therefore requires large amount of computing time ; for instance , in the particular case of the stokes @xmath0 data set of ab  dor at epoch 2001.99 where as much as 27,400 data points must be fitted simultaneously , we typically need a few days of computing time on the fastest available workstations to derive how the reduced  of the fit to the data varies with the differential rotation parameters at a good enough resolution . 
 a typical example of the reduced  maps we obtain from stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 data is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : csqmaps ] . 
 it could be argued that , in the sake of computing time , we could actually derive the optimal differential rotation parameters as part of the imaging process itself , since this would mean no more than fitting another two parameters in addition to the thousands of image pixels we already have to deal with . 
 however , our experience is that the  maps we obtain are not always as nice as those shown in fig . 
 [ fig : csqmaps ] , and sometimes do not feature any physically meaningful minimum . 
 we therefore preferred to keep our initial procedure , and check in each case whether the obtained reduced   maps showed a clear enough minimum to be able to claim safely that differential rotation is indeed detected at the corresponding epoch . 
 another very important advantage of producing reduced  maps is that they can also be used in a very straightforward way to obtain error bars on our estimates of the differential rotation parameters . 
 following press et al . 
 ( 1992 ) , we indeed know that the 1  @xmath5 confidence interval for each differential rotation parameter taken separately can be obtained by searching for all points of the   plane for which the  increase ( with respect to the minimum value in the map ) is smaller than 1 to [ fig : hrdriv ] , which includes all points of the map for which the  increase is smaller than 2.3 ] ( or equivalently for which the reduced  increase is smaller than @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of fitted data points ) , and projecting this ellipsoid onto the  and  axes respectively . the simplest way to evaluate these projections ( and thus the formal error bars for each parameter ) is to compute the curvature radii of the  paraboloid at its minimum and the correlation coefficient between the two parameters ; for a  paraboloid with linear and quadratic terms given by @xmath8 , the value of the optimal parameters and the associated error bars simply write : @xmath9 @xmath10    [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ "" , ]     [ tab : param ]    the conservation of angular momentum within the convective zone therefore implies , in our first test case , the following relation between  and : @xmath11  being a constant , equal to the rotation rate the stellar convective zone would have if spinning as a solid body . in our second test case , this relation becomes : @xmath12 implying in particular that the linear relationship between   and  is significantly less steep than in our first test case ( see table  [ tab : param ] ) . 
 it may be worthwhile to note that , although   and  refer specifically to the differential rotation parameters at the surface of the star , eq . 
 [ eq : rela ] still holds when replacing  and  by their equivalents estimated at radial distance @xmath13 from the centre of the star ( and noted respectively @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) since both do not show any dependence with @xmath13 in this particular case ; however , this is not true in the second test case , where eq . 
 [ eq : relb ] becomes , when expressed as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is equal to @xmath18 with @xmath19 denoting the squared fractional radius @xmath20 . in our second test case 
 , we therefore expect the relationship between @xmath15 and @xmath14 to change ( turning steeper with decreasing @xmath13 ) depending on the depth at which the tracers used to estimate differential rotation are anchored . 
 we can also derive by the same method an expression giving the kinetic energy @xmath21 within the convective zone . the general formula , writing : @xmath22 becomes , in our first test case : @xmath23\ ] ] and in the second test case : @xmath24\ ] ] where @xmath25 stands for : @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the sixth order moment of the fractional radius @xmath28 . in both cases 
 , we obtain that @xmath21 can be written as the sum of two terms , one that we know is constant ( given eqs . 
 [ eq : rela ] and [ eq : relb ] , reflecting the conservation of angular momentum ) and a second , potentially variable , one , directly proportional to @xmath29 . to compute the actual variation in kinetic energy @xmath30 
 , one must note that  can itself be written as the sum of two terms : @xmath31 where  and  respectively represent the minimum value of the observed photospheric shear ( that corresponding to the state closest to solid body rotation ) and the variable contribution to . in this context , the variation of kinetic energy induced by the differential rotation changes writes : @xmath32 ( @xmath25 being replaced by 8/175 in our first test case ) 
 .    it could be tempting to consider that the whole variation in kinetic energy is transformed into magnetic energy as part of the magnetic cycle ( as proposed by lanza et al . 
 however , this conclusion first requires that we obtain an expression similar to that derived above for @xmath30 ( see eq . 
 [ eq : dk ] ) , but for the associated changes in potential energy that result from the fluctuations in the internal angular velocity field and thus to the variations in the shape of the star . 
 we could then derive which fraction of the kinetic plus potential energy is converted into magnetic energy during the activity cycle . 
 similarly , we could also obtain estimates of the fluctuations in the in the stellar quadrupole moment ( as done for instance by applegate 1992 ) , but in the specific context of our study ( i.e.  with the internal velocity fields assumed above in eqs . 
 [ eq : drsun ] and [ eq : drufr ] ) . 
 we however keep this out of this initial study and postpone it for future papers ; it is nevertheless rather safe to claim that the amount of kinetic energy transformed into magnetic energy is of the same magnitude as ( though not strictly equal to ) @xmath30 .      if we now compare the model predictions obtained in sect . 
 [ sect : momentum ] with our observations , we straightforwardly obtain that the second test case ( featuring constant angular velocity along cylinders within the convective zone ) seems much more appropriate . 
 it is indeed only in this case that different depths in the convective zone correspond to different angular shears ( see eqs . 
 [ eq : drsun ] and [ eq : drufr ] ) , thus providing a natural explanation of the discrepancy between the  and  estimates derived from stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 data . 
 if this is indeed the correct interpretation , it would imply that magnetic features , showing the strongest shear , are in general anchored closer to the surface ( where @xmath15 is maximum ) than cool spots . 
 this is at least in qualitative agreement with the conclusions of , e.g. , donati et al . 
 ( 2003 ) , claiming that magnetic features ( and in particular those hosting predominantly azimuthal fields ) must be formed very close to the surface in these stars . 
 further support about the idea that dynamo magnetic fields ( and in particular their toroidal components ) can be produced very close to the stellar surface comes from the recent discovery that the sun features a subphotospheric layer with a strong radial gradient in angular rotation ( corbart & thompson 2002 ) that seems at least able to trigger dynamo action ( dikpati et al .  2002 ) .    however , there is already a number of potential problems with this simple description . 
 it implies for instance that the range of possible latitudinal shears we should observe on a given star at a given epoch goes from  at the surface , down to @xmath33 at the bottom of the convective zone , i.e.  that the maximum ratio between the shears we measure from stokes @xmath1 and stokes @xmath0 data should be @xmath34 . 
 although this is verified for ab  dor ( for which the measured ratio varies from 1.25 to 1.8 and thus remains always smaller than the maximum predicted value of @xmath35 ) , the situation is different for lq  hya where we observe ( at epoch 2001.99 ) differential rotation shears in stokes @xmath1 and stokes @xmath0 that differ by a factor of about 6 ( see table  [ tab : lqhya ] ) , much larger than the theoretical maximum of 1.9 . 
 the origin of this discrepancy is not clear yet ; the fact that only one point ( out of the seven for which measurements from stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 data are available ) exhibits this problem tells at least that the model we propose , although probably oversimplified , is not necessarily a complete nonsense . 
 one possibility is that the model we consider does not take into account the additional shears that probably exist in the interface layer between the convective envelope and the radiative interior , nor that associated with a potential subsurface shear similar to that of the sun ( corbard & thompson 2002 ) ; we may thus imagine that , in some rare cases , the bulk of the differential rotation tracers we use is anchored in these thin shear layers , producing a small number of observations in disagreement with our simple picture . 
 it may also indicate that the differential rotation estimate secured for lq  hya at epoch 2001.99 from stokes @xmath0 data is affected by some spurious contribution that we have not yet identified ( values derived from stokes @xmath1 data being always more reliable and less prone to systematic effects ) ; although we are of course fully aware that is a rather unsatisfying and potentially worrying statement , we can not yet rule out this possibility completely until a larger sample of estimates are available for us to check if this problem is truly an exception or rather a regular occurence . in the rest of the study , we exclude this point from the analysis and further investigate how compatible is the toy model we propose with the rest of our data . 
 a quantitative test consists in measuring the slope of the  versus  relations that we obtain for each star by taking into account all estimates derived in sect . 
 [ sect : diffrot ] ( and shown on figs . 
 [ fig : abdriv ] to [ fig : hrdriv ] ) and comparing it to those the model predict ( see eqs . 
 [ eq : rela ] to [ eq : relc ] ) . to determine the optimal linear relationship that provides the best fit through all data points and their associated confidence ellipses for each star ( something that a conventional least - squares fit , not taking into account the correlated errors on both axes , can not properly achieve ) 
 , we iteratively consider a large number of such relationships ( i.e.  a large number of @xmath36 and  pairs ) and compute , for each of them , the closest approach ( in terms of ) to all error ellipses and the associated overall goodness of fit ( defined as the sum of the minimum square distances to each ellipse ) . from these values , we derive a  map ( in the @xmath37 plane ) , look for a minimum and fit the map by a bi - dimensional paraboloid in the neighbourhood of this minimum ( by a method similar to that described in sect . 
 [ sect : modelling ] ) to obtain both the optimum values of @xmath36 and  as well as the corresponding error bars .    for ab  dor and using all the estimates listed in table  [ tab : abdor ] ( 10 points altogether with their associated error ellipses ) , 
 we obtain from this procedure that the minimum achievable reduced  is 10.5 , already indicating that the model provides a rather poor explanation of our observations . 
 when 2 ( out of the 10 available ) differential rotation estimates are removed from the full sample ( those obtained from stokes @xmath0 data at epoch 1995.94 and from stokes @xmath1 data at epoch 2001.99 ) on the reason that they deviate most from the fit including all points ( at a level of about 5  @xmath5 ) , the minimum achievable reduced  decreases to a smaller , but still uncomfortably high , value of 4.8 , yielding values of @xmath36 and  equal to @xmath38 and @xmath39   respectively ( with 1  @xmath5 error bars enhanced by a factor of @xmath40 to reflect the poor fit obtained with this model ) . 
 note that the value of @xmath36 we derive agrees well with that predicted for the second test model ( equal to 0.52 , see table  [ tab : abdor ] ) . 
 if we now impose @xmath36 to be equal to 0.2 ( the value predicted for our first test model ) , the minimum reduced  that we can now achieve is about 2.6 times larger than that obtained without constraining @xmath36 . 
 this strongly suggests that our first model ( assuming solar - like differential rotation within the convective zone ) is a much less probable option than the second one ( assuming constant angular velocity along cylinders within the convective zone ) , event hough the accuracy to which the observations are fitted with this second model is still not satisfactory .    to investigate whether the agreement with the data can be improved 
 , the best way is to attempt exploiting all built - in characteristics of our simple model , for instance by taking explicitly into account , when comparing with the data , the fact that the different types of tracers may be anchored at different convective depths . to achieve this , we proceed along the lines presented in sect .  [ 
 sect : momentum ] and try to measure the differential rotation estimates corresponding to stokes @xmath0 and stokes @xmath1 data with different linear relationships ( using eqs . 
 [ eq : relc ] and [ eq : lambdap ] ) . 
 more specifically , we proceed as explained in the paragraphs above , except that we now have three independent parameters , @xmath36 ( the slope of the  versus   relationship in the stokes @xmath1 data , presumably referring to the surface layers ) , @xmath41 ( the slope of this relationship in the stokes @xmath0 data , presumably referring to deeper convective layers ) and one value of . 
 the only difference from the previous procedure is that we now fit a three dimensional ( instead of a two dimensional ) paraboloid to the   map . 
 this new modelling attempt ( with the same two data points excluded ) yields a minimum reduced  of 3.2 , along with values of @xmath36 , @xmath41 and  respectively equal to @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44  ( error bars being again scaled up in proportion to the square root of the reduced ) . 
 although the fit to the data is now more satisfactory and the derived value of @xmath41 falls within the expected range ( between 0.13 and 0.40 , given the inverse squared fractional anchoring depths @xmath45 obtained from ratioing the estimated shears at each epoch , see above ) , the value of @xmath36 we extract is poorly compatible with that we expect for the surface layers ( equal to 0.52 ) , with a mismatch of about 3  @xmath5 . repeating the procedure with @xmath36 being fixed to the expected value of 0.5 yields no improvement in the accuracy level to which the data are fitted with respect to the two parameter fit described above . 
 we therefore conclude that the estimates of differential rotation and of its temporal variations at the surface of ab  dor suggest that the distribution of angular velocities within the convective zone is closer to that we expect for rapid rotators than to that of the sun . 
 however , the simple model we propose , in addition to the fact that the accuracy level to which it fits the data is only rough , also predicts some features that are not reproduced in the observations , and in particular the different slopes of the linear  versus  relationships expected for tracers anchored at different convective depths . 
 what it may simply indicate is that our test models are still far too simple to match the observations at that level of detail . 
 further attempts , with more realistic large scale angular velocity fields in the convective zone will be the subject of forthcoming papers . 
 the first part of this experiment can also be applied to our lq  hya data . using the two parameter fitting procedure described above through the available measurements ( 4 points with associated error ellipses , once discarded the estimate from stokes @xmath0 data obtained at epoch 2001.99 , see above ) , we obtain values of @xmath36 and  that are respectively equal to @xmath46 and @xmath47  and provide a nice fit to the data , with an associated reduced  level of 0.84 . for this star 
 again , we obtain that the slope of the observed versus  linear relationship is not compatible with a solar like differential rotation within the convective zone ; repeating the same procedure with @xmath36 fixed to 0.2 ( as required by our first test model ) increases the minimum reduced  up to 7.2 , i.e.  8.4 times that achieved with the unconstrained fit . assuming now constant angular velocity along cylinders , the model would then require the tracers to be anchored at about mid depth within the convective zone ( at a fractional radius of about 0.86 ) to agree with the observations . 
 another possibility is of course that the internal velocity field of lq  hya is somehow intermediate between that of a very fast rotator like ab  dor and that of a slow rotator like the sun , reflecting the fact that the rotation rate of lq  hya ( 3.9  ) is bracketed by that of ab  dor ( 12.2  d ) and that of the sun ( 0.25  ) . in this context , 
 contours of constant angular rotation within the convective zone should start deviating from being aligned with the rotation axis , and get slightly tilted towards the radial direction . once again , we caution that these conclusions are still highly speculative and require more observational material ( in particular measurements on other stars rotating slower and faster than lq  hya ) to be settled more firmly .    carrying out a similar investigation in the particular case of hr  1099 
 would also be very interesting , as our second model predicts a significantly higher slope for the  versus  linear relation ( equal to about 0.68 , see table  [ tab : param ] ) due to the fact that the convective zone ( pertaining more than 99% of the total stellar volume ) is much deeper in this star 
 . the smaller rotation rate of hr  1099 ( 2.2  ) may also act at the same time to decrease the value of @xmath36 with respect to the predicted one . 
 since no temporal variations of differential rotation are however yet detected on hr  1099 , all this remains essentially a matter of speculation , until more accurate estimates ( such as those of petit et al . 
 2002 , but covering a longer time span ) are available . 
 another important aspect of this problem concerns the amount of kinetic energy that the star either withdraws from or releases into the total energy reservoir of the convective zone when switching from one state of differential rotation to another . 
 in particular , we should make sure that the total power associated with the energy transfer from or into kinetic energy is significantly smaller , or at the very least not larger , than the stellar luminosity itself , to ensure that the process we invoke to explain our observations ( which in principle should apply to the vast majority of rapidly rotating cool stars ) does not implicitly require at the same time that the star looses its energy at a very fast rate . 
 of course , we reckon that the energy transfers we invoke likely correspond to some redistribution process between the various reservoirs in which the convective zone can store energy ( i.e.  kinetic , potential and magnetic energy wells ) ; however , we suspect that these transfers are inevitably associated with some energy dissipation , i.e.  that a significant fraction ( the exact proportion being poorly known ) of the energy transfered is lost ( and thus radiated ) in the process .    the changes in kinetic energy associated with the differential rotation fluctuations can easily be estimated from eq . 
 [ eq : dk ] . in the case of ab 
 dor , the results reported in sect . 
 [ sect : abdor ] suggest that   and  are respectively equal to 60 and 40  , implying that @xmath30 should be equal to @xmath48 or about @xmath49  erg . assuming this transfer occurs progressively over a typical timespan of a few years ( @xmath50  s ) 
 , we obtain that the power required to operate the change we invoke corresponds to about 1% of the total stellar luminosity . 
 ( note that @xmath30 is only weakly dependent on the assumed internal velocity field , varying only by a factor of about two between our two test models ) . 
 for lq  hya , our observations indicate that  is probably close to zero while  gets as large as 200  , implying that @xmath30 should now be equal to @xmath51 or about @xmath52  erg . 
 if we again consider that the corresponding evolution occurs on a time scale of a few years , we find that the associated power corresponds to 10% of the total stellar luminosity . 
 although this sounds rather large already , one must keep in mind that only a small fraction of this amount is actually lost ( i.e.   radiated ) in the process ; it suggests that , even in the case of the star that exhibits the most drastic effect ( i.e.  lq  hya ) , the corresponding power dissipated in the process does probably not exceed 1% of the stellar luminosity . since no temporal changes were detected in the case of hr  1099 , we thus can not obtain a similar estimate without any ( hopefully reasonable ) assumption on  and . 
 taking @xmath53 and @xmath54   as a guess ( and to remain grossly compatible with the differential rotation changes that the orbital period fluctuations observed on this system request , donati 1999 ) , we obtain that @xmath30 reaches as much as @xmath55  erg and that the associated power required to drive this change corresponds to about 3% of the stellar luminosity ( provided the change in  occurs over a few years ) . 
 if we finally assume that most of the changes in kinetic energy associated with the fluctuations in differential rotation are associated with equal ( and opposite ) variations in magnetic energy occurring throughout the whole convective zone , we can obtain a very rough estimate of the average magnetic field strength required to drive these changes . 
 we caution that this estimate is necessarily very rough for at least several reasons . 
 the first reason is of course that the magnetic field is expected to be very intermittent throughout the convective zone and to exhibit a strong gradient in the radial direction ( comparable to the one that the gas pressure undergoes ) , implying that an average magnetic field strength over the whole convective volume is not extremely meaningful ; the second reason ( already mentioned above ) is that fluctuations in potential energy are also expected to occur ( as a consequence of the changes in the shape of the star ) and probably participate as well in the total energy budget . 
 however , a rough estimate being better than no estimate , we decided to mention in the paper the derived average magnetic strengths , to at least convince the readers that the magnitude of these fields is physically plausible . for ab 
 dor and lq  hya , we obtain magnetic intensities of 9 and 23  kg respectively ; using the above guesses in the case of hr  1099 yields a field strength of 5  kg . 
 this is clearly larger that the magnetic strengths estimated at the surface ( e.g.  donati 1999 ; donati et al . 
 2003 ) , and reflects the strong radial gradient of field strength ( pointing inwards ) that probably exists within the convective zone . 
 this paper reports positive detections of surface differential rotation on two rapidly rotating cool stars at several epochs , by using stellar surface features ( both cool spots and magnetic regions ) as tracers of the large scale latitudinal shear that distorts the convective envelope in this type of stars . 
 we also report definite evidence that this differential rotation is different when estimated from cool spots or magnetic regions , and that it undergoes temporal fluctuations of potentially large amplitude on a time scale of a few years . 
 we consider these results as further evidence that the dynamo processes operating in these stars are distributed throughout the convective zone rather than being confined at its base as in the sun . with the help of two very simple models of the angular velocity field within the convective zone ( one that resembles that of the sun and one supposed to represent that of ultra fast rotators ) , we explore the quantitative implications that angular momentum conservation within the convective zone imposes on potential variations of surface differential rotation with time . 
 this modelling suggests , from comparison with our observations , that the rotation velocity field within the convective zone of the stars we investigated is not like that of the sun , and may resemble that we expect for rapid rotators , with constant angular velocity along cylinders aligned with the rotation axis . 
 the power required to drive the observed changes in the differential rotation of the convective zone are estimated to be of the order of 1 to 10% of the total stellar luminosity ; we speculate that these changes result from the dynamo processes ( and from the underlying magnetic cycle ) that periodically converts magnetic energy into kinetic energy and vice versa .    the technique outlined in this paper corresponds to the first practical method for investigating the large scale rotation velocity field in convective zones of cool active stars . 
 in particular , we note that it can already provide us with more information than what one could obtain with other existing techniques such as asteroseismology ( expected to yield rather poor resolution on the internal rotation profile in the radial direction , even when operated from space , at least in the next decade ) . 
 we therefore strongly argue in favour of renewing the experiment reported here , in order to explore more extensively the full capabilities of this new method 
 . monitoring continuously the same star for time spans as long as several months every year for several years would be especially interesting if one wants to disclose short term chaotic variability ( presumably due to the natural randomness inherent to turbulence and differential rotation ) from the long term supposedly periodic evolution driven by the magnetic cycle .    in this context , 
 the new spectropolarimeter espadons , designed for maximum efficiency and being built for the 3.6  m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( commissioning scheduled for spring 2003 ) , represents the optimal instrumental facility for carrying the observations that this new method requires . 
 we expect in particular that the large gain in sensitivity that this new tool will provide over older generation instruments should give us the opportunity of both extending the available data set to a much larger sample of stars and studying the physical processes of interest to us in much more details . 
 this research program will also strongly benefit from having similar instruments on smaller telescopes to allow the long , repeated and if possible multisite , observational campaigns that are necessary for optimising the performances of the investigation we suggest . in this respect , 
 the 2  m bernard lyot telescope atop pic du midi in france , that will soon be equipped with narval ( a carbon copy of espadons , whose construction just started ) and dedicated to spectropolarimetric studies , should be extremely useful for this kind of research .

each parameter is to compute the curvature radii of the paraboloid at its minimum and the correlation coefficient between the two parameters for a paraboloid with linear and quadratic terms given by the value of the optimal parameters and the associated error bars simply write cols tab param the conservation of angular momentum within the convective zone therefore implies in our first test case the following relation between and being a constant equal to the rotation rate the stellar convective zone would have if spinning as a solid body. the first reason is of course that the magnetic field is expected to be very intermittent throughout the convective zone and to exhibit a strong gradient in the radial direction comparable to the one that the gas pressure undergoes implying that an average magnetic field strength over the whole convective volume is not extremely meaningful the second reason already mentioned above is that fluctuations in potential energy are also expected to

through all data points and their associated confidence ellipses for each star something that a conventional least squares fit not taking into account the correlated errors on both axes can not properly achieve we iteratively consider a large number of such relationships i e a large number of and pairs and compute for each of them the closest approach in terms of to all error ellipses and the associated overall goodness of fit defined as the sum of the minimum square distances to each ellipse . this typically means that we have to compute a few hundred brightness and magnetic images for each star at each season which therefore requires large amount of computing time for instance in the particular case of the stokes data set of ab dor at epoch 2001 99 where as much as 27 400 data points must be fitted simultaneously we typically need a few days of computing time on the fastest available workstations to derive how the reduced of the fit to the data varies with the differential rotation parameters at a good enough resolution. it may also indicate that the differential rotation estimate secured for lq hya at epoch 2001 99 from stokes data is affected by some spurious contribution that we have not yet identified values derived from stokes data being always more reliable and less prone to systematic effects although we are of course fully aware that is a rather unsatisfying and potentially worrying statement we can not yet rule out this possibility completely until a larger sample of estimates are available for us to check if this problem is truly an exception or rather a regular occurence. one possibility is that the model we consider does not take into account the additional shears that probably exist in the interface layer between the convective envelope and the radiative interior nor that associated with a potential subsurface shear similar to that of the sun corbard thompson 2002 we may thus imagine that in some rare cases the bulk of the differential rotation tracers we use is anchored in these thin shear layers producing a small number of observations in disagreement with our simple picture. when 2 out of the 10 available

processes supposed to concentrate mostly in the interface layer between the radiative interior and the convective envelope i e the only place where the field can be stored for a time comparable to the period of the activity cycle can not be invoked to justify not only the presence of a large scale magnetic field e g johns krull valenti 1996 but also their very intense activity level. this method consists in assuming a given surface differential rotation law that we implement in our indirect stellar surface imaging code and producing brightness or magnetic images of the stellar surface from all unpolarised or circularly polarised data available for this star at a given season we then take as most probable the differential rotation law that generates the images with lowest information content given a certain data fit accuracy or equivalently the images that provide the best fit to the data given a certain image information content . the aim of this paper is to apply this method to the extensive spectropolarimetric data set that we collected in the last seven yr for three stars namely the young ultra fast rotator ab doradus the young k0 star lq hydrae and the k1 subgiant of the

 @xcite , p. 94 ) , seem like exceptional cases , which would not arise in physics in any case .    there is , however , a system of differential equations , arising as a limiting case of a much studied physical problem , in which uniqueness fails for _ every _ solution at _ every _ time . 
 the system is singular laplacian growth @xcite , @xcite . 
 one might call this behavior `` maximally nonunique . '' 
 it is so different from the usual behavior of differential equations that it hardly seems like a differential system at all . 
 the way it occurs is the following : the theory of singular laplacian growth describes the motions of certain singularities of a conformal map , which are all located on the unit circle in the complex plane . 
 they move on the circle , but they can also `` split , '' introducing new singularities , at any time . 
 this behavior , which does not sound very remarkable , essentially implies the maximal nonuniqueness property . in ref . 
 @xcite the term `` fragile '' was suggested for such a system , because its distinguishing feature is that its singularities can break apart . 
 it is natural to ask if other physical systems might reduce to a fragile system in some limit , and if the fragile property manifests itself in the behavior of the system . 
 turbulence is certainly a candidate to be a fragile system : like laplacian growth , turbulence is a phenomenon in which a differential equation has unexpectedly complex solutions . in this paper 
 i argue that turbulence is a system that has a fragile ( maximally nonunique ) limiting case . 
 the limiting case is the burgers equation . 
 ( on rather different grounds a resemblance between the problems of turbulence and laplacian growth has been noted by hastings and levitov @xcite ) . 
 the burgers equation @xcite , @xcite @xmath0 has played a shifting role in the problem of turbulence . 
 it was first introduced as a one - dimensional zero pressure version of the navier - stokes equation ( with @xmath1 the viscosity ) in the hope that it might exhibit in its solutions some of the complexity of turbulence . by the hopf - cole trick , 
 though , it was found to be equivalent to a linear diffusion equation , so that the initial value problem could be solved explicitly : one can write a formula for the solution ! that is surely too simple to be turbulent . 
 attention was thus focussed on the only case which still seemed promising , the @xmath2 limit , the inviscid burgers equation , which is a conservation law for @xmath3 . in this limit 
 the solution may develop discontinuities ( `` shocks '' ) . 
 the distribution of shocks , and their development in time , for random initial data , is a problem called burgers turbulence . 
 the reason that one should think of this as a @xmath2 limit , and not simply as a @xmath4 version of the equation , is that for @xmath4 the solution is ambiguous . to be sure , the solution of the inviscid equation is immediate by the method of characteristics : @xmath3 is constant along lines @xmath5 ( hence straight lines in the x - t plane ) . 
 but if the characteristics cross , which they certainly will do in the case of random initial data @xmath6 , then one has multiple determinations of @xmath7 , as in fig . 
 1 . the resolution of this difficulty is to take the formula for @xmath7 in case @xmath8 , which is unambiguous , and let @xmath1 approach zero . 
 the result is as shown in fig . 
 2 : a discontinuity forms at a definite location , separating one determination of @xmath3 from another . 
 the same procedure shows that shocks interact in a definite manner , coalescing as shown in fig . 
 3 when one overtakes or collides with another . 
 the rules for how these discontinuities form and interact were known long ago in the theory of compressible gas dynamics , where they are called the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions ( see ref . 
 @xcite , pp . 
 488 - 90 , ref . 
 @xcite , p. 596 ) . 
 they are justified by appeal to the second law of thermodynamics : while @xmath3 is conserved , entropy must increase in the shock . 
 that is what the argument with @xmath8 also does : we resolve the ambiguity in the inviscid burgers equation by putting in a dissipative term with the right sign . 
 the second law of thermodynamics says mechanical energy should be dissipated in the shock , and not created . 
 it is this condition which leads to the interaction rule illustrated in fig . 
 now recall the suggestion of onsager , as emphasized by alexandre chorin , among others , that a statistical theory of the turbulent steady state should be characterized by a negative temperature ( see ref . 
 @xcite , chapter 4 ) . 
 what is meant is that there is a maxwell - boltzmann probability distribution @xmath9 which , instead of giving more weight to the low energy microstates in the ensemble description of the macrostate , as is usual , gives more weight to high energy microstates . 
 ( this statistical `` temperature '' of turbulence has nothing to do with usual thermodynamic temperature , which is only weakly coupled to the mechanical degrees of freedom of interest . ) 
 let us accept this idea for the moment . 
 the second law says that entropy should increase , or perhaps better , in this more general situation , that information should be lost , in irreversible processes 
 . stated in terms of the free energy @xmath10 ( and remembering @xmath11 ) this says that free energy should _ increase _ in the approach to the steady state . 
 this is opposite to what is usual . putting onsager s idea together with the ideas of burgers turbulence 
 thus requires that mechanical energy should be created in the shock rather than dissipated . 
 we see that the limit in the inviscid burgers equation should be @xmath12 , i.e. , we should imagine the viscosity approaching zero through _ negative _ values , from _ 
 below_.    the inviscid burger s equation does not contain temperature or @xmath1 explicitly , of course , but the rules for how the shocks form and interact are now different . 
 the following argument gives the simple idea which is at the heart of this paper . 
 we do not try to give it an elaborate justification , since , like many simple ideas , it may contain some truth even if the arguments are wrong . 
 the argument is that there is a symmetry of the ( general ) burgers equation , @xmath13 we can convert the @xmath14 inviscid burgers equation into the familiar @xmath8 inviscid burgers equation by reversing the signs of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , i.e. , reflecting graphs like fig . 
 3 through the origin . the result is fig . 
 4 , in which a single shock has spontaneously split into two , with no reference to initial conditions . 
 this is the fragile property . 
 if shocks can split at any time , as indicated , then the solutions to the differential equation are maximally nonunique . 
 our aim in the previous section was to show that the equations which describe fluid flow , the navier - stokes equations , become maximally nonunique , or `` fragile , '' in some limit . 
 this limit is rather far removed from physical reality , however . 
 one naturally wonders how , if at all , the nonuniqueness property might manifest itself in a real system . 
 the example of laplacian growth encourages one to think that real processes would not completely obscure the underlying `` fragile '' processes @xcite . 
 the system we have imagined is characterized by two temperatures : a `` superhot '' negative temperature , which describes the ensemble of microscopic entities which make up the turbulent state , and the usual temperature , which describes the ensemble at the molecular level . 
 these two ensembles interact only weakly , it has been argued , but , again by the second law of thermodynamics , to the extent that they interact , there must be a flow of energy from the first to the second , from the turbulent ensemble to the molecular ensemble . 
 this picture is reminiscent of the kolmogorov cascade idea ( ref . 
 @xcite , chapter 3 ) , and suggests identifying the turbulent ensemble with the `` energy range , '' ( a hypothetical range in @xmath17 space containing most of the energy ) , and the molecular ensemble with the `` dissipation range , '' ( a range in @xmath17 space , disjoint from the energy range , in which dissipation is important ) , i.e. , assigning a temperature gradient to the kolmogorov picture , with negative temperature at small @xmath17 and positive temperature at large @xmath17 . 
 it is in the energy range , then , at small @xmath17 , that the fragile processes of nonuniqueness would occur . 
 these processes extract mechanical energy from the negative temperature `` bath , '' and this energy must ultimately derive from the forces maintaining the turbulence . 
 thus the onset of fragile processes would appear , on the macroscopic scale , as an increase in resistance to these applied forces . at a more microscopic level 
 it would be the onset of nonuniqueness , allowing splitting and proliferation of microscopic entities as in fig . 
 4 . at a still more microscopic level , corresponding to the dissipation range , the usual picture would apply , and one would have dissipative processes like fig . 
 3 . in this view turbulence _ is _ the visible manifestation of nonuniqueness on the intermediate scale of the energy range , and the work done by external forces goes directly into the proliferation of singularities at that scale , and only indirectly into dissipation .    in terms of modelling turbulence 
 , it suggests that the proliferative processes of the energy range , which are still hypothetical , may be like the dissipative processes of the dissipation range , but time reversed ( and on a larger length scale ) . in this way 
 the abstract picture suggested here might persist in a more realistic dynamics . 
 the issue of nonuniqueness may also be relevant to cfd modelling of turbulence . 
 the algorithms of differential equation solvers are not set up for equations which do not have unique solutions . 
 experience with laplacian growth confirms that proximity to a nonunique model may indicate trouble for conventional numerical solutions .    99 r. courant and d. hilbert , _ methods of mathematical physics _ , vol 2 ( interscience publishers , 1962 ) .

79,"over the past decade , the search for sources of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) has begun to focus upon small scale anisotropy in event arrival directions . 
 this refers to statistically significant excesses occurring at the scale of @xmath1 . 
 the interest in this sort of anisotropy has largely been fueled by the observations of the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) . in 1999 
 @xcite and again in 2001 @xcite , the agasa collaboration reported observing what eventually became seven clusters ( six `` doublets '' and one `` triplet '' ) with estimated energies above @xmath2  ev . 
 several attempts that have been made to ascertain the significance of these clusters returned chance probabilities of @xmath3 @xcite to 0.08 @xcite . 
 by contrast , the monocular ( and stereo ) analyses that have been presented by the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) demonstrate that the level of autocorrelation observed in our sample is completely consistent with that expected from background coincidences @xcite . 
 any analysis of hires monocular data needs to take into account that the angular resolution in monocular mode is highly asymmetric . 
 it is very difficult to compare the results of the hires monocular and agasa analyses . 
 they are very different in the way that they measure autocorrelation . 
 differences in the published energy spectra of the two experiments suggest an energy scale difference of 30% @xcite . additionally , the two experiments observe uhecrs in very different ways . 
 the hires experiment has an energy - dependent aperture and an exposure with a seasonal variability @xcite . 
 these differences make it very difficult get an intuitive grasp of what hires should see if the agasa claim of autocorrelation is justified . in order to develop this sort of intuition 
 , we apply the same analysis to both agasa and hires data . 
 the data set that we consider consists of events that were included in the hires - i monocular spectrum measurement @xcite . 
 this set contains 52 events observed between may  1997 and february  2003 with measured energies greater than @xmath0  ev . the data set represents a cumulative exposure of @xmath4  km@xmath5sr@xmath6yr at @xmath7  ev . 
 this data was subject to a number of quality cuts that are detailed in the above - mentioned papers @xcite . 
 we previously verified that this data set was consistent with monte carlo predictions in many ways including impact parameter ( @xmath8 ) distributions @xcite and zenith angle distributions @xcite . for this study , we presumed an average atmospheric clarity @xcite .    in order to calculate the autocorrelation function for this subset of data , we must first parameterize the hires - i monocular angular resolution . for a monocular air fluorescence detector , 
 angular resolution consists of two components , the plane of reconstruction , that is the plane in which the shower is observed , and the angle @xmath9 within the plane of reconstruction ( see figure  [ figure : picture ] ) .    [ cols=""^ "" , ] 
 we can see the result of these simulations . 
 the observed hires - i signal corresponds to the 90% confidence upper limit with the inclusion of only 3.5 doublets beyond random background coincidence . 
 if we repeat this analysis with first , a 7.5% reduction in the estimated angular resolution values and second , a 7.5% increase in the estimated angular resolution values , we obtain a range for the 90% confidence upper limit of @xmath10 $ ] doublets and a range for the 95% confidence upper limit of @xmath11 $ ] doublets . 
 a final area of concern is the systematic uncertainty in the determination of atmospheric clarity . 
 because hourly atmospheric observations are not available for the entire hires - i monocular data set , we have relied upon the use of an average atmospheric profile for the reconstruction of our data @xcite . while different atmospheric conditions have negligible impact on the determination of the arrival direction for events with measured energies this high , differing conditions can have an impact on energy estimation and thus the number of events that are included in our data set . over the @xmath12 error space for our estimation of atmospheric conditions , the total number of events in our data set fluctuates on the interval @xmath13 $ ] . 
 the value of the observable , @xmath14}$ ] , has a fluctuation on the interval @xmath15 $ ] owing to addition and subtraction of events from the data set . 
 note that in neither case does the value of @xmath14}$ ] exceed the mean value ( 0.99250 ) expected for a background set . 
 we conclude that the hires - i monocular detector sees no evidence of clustering in its highest energy events . furthermore , the hires - i monocular data has an intrinsic sensitivity to global autocorrelation such that we can claim at the 90% confidence level that there can be no more than 3.5 doublets above that which would be expected by background coincidence in the hires - i monocular data set above @xmath0  ev . from this result 
 , we can then derive , with a 90% confidence level , that no more than 13% of the observed hires - i events could be sharing common arrival directions . 
 this data set is comparable to the sensitivity of the reported agasa data set if one assumes that there is indeed a 30% energy scale difference between the two experiments . 
 it should be emphasized that this conclusion pertains only to point sources of the sort claimed by the agasa collaboration . 
 furthermore , because a measure of autocorrelation makes no assumption of the underlying astrophysical mechanism that results in clustering phenomena , we can not claim that the hires monocular analysis and the agasa analysis are inconsistent beyond a specified confidence level .

80,"interstellar gas in the solar neighborhood has a variety of thermal and chemical phases , including cold atomic gas inside or mixed with cold molecular clouds ( e.g. , sato & fukui 1978 ) , cool and warm atomic gas on the envelopes of molecular clouds ( chromey et al . 
 1989 ; andersson & wannier 1993 ; wannier et al . 
 1993 ) and in the diffuse , low density medium ( kulkarni & heiles 1987 ) , cold molecules in dark and dense clouds ( combes 1991 ) and in translucent clouds ( magnani , blitz & mundy 1985 ) , warm molecules in dense clouds near embedded luminous stars ( e.g. , cesaroni et al . 1994 ) , dense photo - ionized gas in the neighborhoods of o and b - type stars , low - density ionized gas between these stars ( walterbos & braun 1994 ; reynolds 1995 ; ferguson et al . 1996 ) , and hot , shock - heated gas near supernovae and windy stars ( ostriker & mckee 1988 ) . 
 there is also considerable variety in the types of molecules that are present inside dark clouds , ranging from primarily h@xmath0 in translucent clouds ( spitzer & jenkins 1975 ; magnani et al . 
 1998 ) , with a possible trace of pah or long - chain molecules ( leger & puget 1984 ; tulej et al . 1998 ) , to a mixture of complex molecules in dense clouds ( e.g. , langer et al . 1997 
 ; see reviews by van dishoeck and thaddeus , this conference ) . 
 the thermal and chemical states of the cold and cool gas have such a great variety because the clouds shield themselves to different levels from photodissociative radiation and radiant heating . 
 this makes the molecular abundance and temperature depend on density , column density , metallicity , age , and local radiation field , all of which vary from cloud to cloud and with radius in the galaxy . 
 the nature of cloud _ structure _ does not change this much , because it is largely the result of turbulence , self - gravity , and local explosions , which seem to act the same way everywhere . 
 here we discuss the dominant processes that affect the molecular and thermal states of the gas , and we review the some of the aspects of cloud structure that are likely to arise from turbulence . 
 interstellar clouds shield themselves from photo - dissociative radiation when the molecular formation rate ( in @xmath1 ) integrated over the cloud radius exceeds the molecular dissociation flux ( in @xmath2 ) from incident starlight ( jura 1975 ; federman , glassgold , & kwan 1979 ; van dishoeck & black 1988 ; sternberg 1989 ; hollenbach & tielens 1997 ) . 
 this means that clouds determine their own molecular abundances for any particular radiation field , depending on their density , column density , and metallicity . 
 dense clouds with only moderate column densities can have the same h@xmath0/h ratio as lower density clouds with larger column densities . as a result , 
 _ regions with larger pressures tend to be more molecular _ 
 , i.e. , higher pressures lead to higher densities and greater self - shielding at all cloud masses . 
 one implication of this result is that most galaxies have a radial gradient in the molecular fraction outside the nuclear or barred region because the pressure is lower at larger radii ( elmegreen 1993 ; honma , sofue , & arimoto 1995 ) . 
 the total ( turbulent+magnetic+thermal ) interstellar medium pressure varies approximately as @xmath3 for gas column density @xmath4 and total gas+star column density in the gas layer , @xmath5 . 
 typically , @xmath6 , so @xmath7 . 
 this means that as @xmath4 decreases exponentially with radius in a typical spiral galaxy , the total pressure decreases with radius too , and it has half the scale length . 
 this corresponds to a rather rapid decrease of interstellar pressure with galactocentric radius . 
 radial pressure gradients lead to the appearance of `` molecular rings '' in galaxies that have inner disk cutoffs from a bar or bulge . 
 molecular rings are not true rings , like galactic resonance rings , but only molecular emission concentrations that result from smooth exponential disks with inner cutoffs . 
 the rapid decrease of molecular fraction with increasing radius beyond the `` ring '' results primarily from large - scale pressure changes . 
 high latitude clouds , shells , spiral - arm dust lanes , and other pressurized fronts should also have large molecular fractions compared to other clouds with the same column density . 
 a good example of the influence of pressure on molecule formation is shown by the nearby l1457 cloud , which has h@xmath0 primarily in the southern part , where it was recently compressed ( moriarty - schieven , andersson & wannier 1997 ) . 
 the _ thermal _ state in clouds is generally related to the _ molecular _ state , at least in the solar neighborhood , because once a cloud begins to shield itself in the h@xmath0 lines , it also becomes optically thick from dust . 
 then it removes its principle quiescent heat source , which is the photoejection of electrons off grains ( de jong 1977 ; draine 1978 ; bakes & tielens 1994 ) . 
 molecular clouds need not always be cold , though . 
 different photons are involved with photodissocation , which is limited to spectral lines , and photoejection , which is a continuum process . besides 
 , density and column density can vary separately . 
 consequently , there are warm molecular clouds in the diffuse phase , i.e. , high density , low column - density clouds ( spitzer & cochran 1973 ) . 
 these clouds tend to dominate the diffuse cloud population in the inner ( high pressure ) regions of bright galaxies ( polk et al . 
 1988 ; honma , sofue , & arimoto 1995 ) . 
 there are also diffuse or dense molecular clouds in the high pressure regions of _ dim _ galaxies that are so cold they do not emit much co radiation ( allen et al . 
 such temperature variations for molecular gas inversely affect the conversion factor from integrated co linewidth to molecular hydrogen . 
 high temperature molecular clouds have proportionally less molecular matter per unit co emission than low temperature molecular clouds . 
 figure [ fig : nn ] shows a schematic diagram of the cold and cool interstellar cloud phases in the parameter space that is defined by density and column density . 
 the rising line that separates diffuse from self - gravitating gas comes from the relation @xmath8 for velocity dispersion @xmath9 . 
 this is the threshold for strong self - gravity in a cloud . 
 the falling line that separates molecular from atomic gas comes from the equation @xmath10 for metallicity @xmath11 and radiation field @xmath12 , normalized to solar neighborhood values . 
 this relation is based on the balance between the h@xmath0 formation rate ( on dust , hence the @xmath11 dependence ) along a column of gas , @xmath13 , and the photodissociation rate per unit area , which is proportional to the absorbed photon flux , @xmath14 . 
 the column density dependence in @xmath15 accounts for extra absorption in the line wings as @xmath16 increases ( federman , glassgold , & kwan 1979 ) . 
 equation [ eq : mole ] was considered in more detail by sternberg ( 1989 ) , who included a temperature dependence for the molecule formation rate and dust extinction . 
 sternberg also approximated the column density dependence of @xmath15 as @xmath17 for pure linewing absorption . according to sternberg , 
 dust dominates molecules for the absorption of light in the shielding layer when @xmath18 , which translates to @xmath19\left[z / z_0\right]\right)^{1/2}}}>>1 . 
 \label{eq : sternberg}\ ] ] ( this assumes sternberg s molecule formation rate , @xmath20 , and dust cross section , @xmath21 , both scale with metallicity , @xmath11 . ) if we scale the federman , glassgold & kwan ( 1979 ) result with @xmath22 instead of @xmath23 and add a @xmath24 dependence to the molecule formation rate ( from the thermal speed at which h atoms impact grains ) , then the equation of detailed balance implied by equation [ eq : mole ] , @xmath25 , gives a molecular column density for self - shielding of @xmath26 , and a corresponding dust opacity @xmath27 . 
 the square root of this opacity is essentially the quantity @xmath28 in sternberg ( 1989 ) , to within a factor of 2 . 
 the column density at this opacity limit is approximately @xmath29 @xmath30 for standard interstellar extinction , which means that points to the right of @xmath31 @xmath30 at high density @xmath32 in figure [ fig : nn ] are primarily shielded by dust , and points to the left are _ self_-shielded by molecules . in both cases , the clouds are molecular , as indicated . 
 low density clouds are generally atomic except at very high column density , at which point they may turn molecular if the conditions are right . 
 however , real clouds with very low densities are not likely to turn molecular at high column density if their spatial extent is so large that they include many field stars inside them . in that case 
 , there is no proper boundary for self - shielding . 
 such clouds will still make a transition from diffuse to self - gravitating at moderate column densities , however . 
 this explains why the largest hi clouds in spiral galaxies can be self - gravitating , and conversely , why the largest self - gravitating clouds are often atomic ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1983 ; 1987 ; rand 1995 ) . 
 figure [ fig : nn ] also suggests that high density clouds are generally molecular , except at very low column density . when the density is high because of a high pressure , molecular clouds can be diffuse . 
 the internal density can also be high in a region with a low ambient pressure provided the cloud is self - gravitating ; this makes the cloud molecular again .    in the solar neighborhood , 
 most clouds make a transition from atomic and diffuse at low column density to molecular and self - gravitating at high column density , with relatively little total cloud mass in the form of molecular diffuse gas or atomic self - gravitating gas . 
 however , in the spiral arms of our galaxy , atomic self - gravitating gas is prevalent in the form of giant hi cloud complexes ( @xmath33 m@xmath34 ) , which have relatively small molecular cores ( @xmath35 m@xmath34 ) that are also self - gravitating . 
 such clouds are often regularly spaced along the spiral arms . in other galaxies such as m51 
 , these @xmath33 m@xmath34 spiral arm clouds are mostly molecular ( rand 1993 ) . 
 this is a sensible result for m51 because it has a relatively high total gas column density , and therefore a high pressure ( @xmath36 ) . 
 figure [ fig : nm ] makes these same points in a different way , showing the densities of diffuse and self - gravitating gas as functions of cloud mass . 
 the larson ( 1981 ) relation between density and mass is used for the self - gravitating clouds . 
 it comes from the two equations @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    at low mass , both diffuse and self - gravitating states are possible , as in the usual two - fold solution to the virial equation with external pressure : @xmath39 in this equation , for masses less than @xmath40 , there are stable states with low density and negligible self - gravity , bounded by external pressure , and there are stable states with high density and strong self - gravity , bounded by gravity , all at the same mass . 
 similarly , in the interstellar medium , there are low mass diffuse clouds as well as low mass self - gravitating clouds , such as bok globules .    at high mass , 
 equation [ eq : virial ] has only one stable solution and that is with self - gravity dominant . 
 similarly in the interstellar medium , most massive clouds are strongly self - gravitating . 
 this mass limit changes when a magnetic field is present , but only slightly if the field has the equipartition energy density ( mouschovias & spitzer 1976 ) .    also shown in figure [ fig : nm ] are short lines that indicate transitions from atomic to molecular phase as the mass increases ( @xmath41 ) , from a mixture of non - self - gravitating and self - gravitating clouds to pure self - gravitating clouds ( @xmath42 ) , and from molecular back to atomic gas ( @xmath43 . the origin of this latter transition , which occurs at around @xmath33 m@xmath34 for normal pressure , is that the density of a massive cloud is so low as a result of the high velocity dispersion and the requirement of pressure equilibrium , that the cloud can no longer shield itself from photodissociative radiation . 
 the fact that the cloud is strongly self - gravitating does not matter . 
 examples of such clouds are again the giant hi complexes in spiral arms . at higher pressures , 
 this transition from molecular to atomic self - gravitating clouds occurs at higher masses . 
 two thermal phases of atomic gas , cool and warm , can co - exist in the solar neighborhood at the _ same _ pressure and radiation field because of inflections in the thermal cooling rate as a function of temperature ( field , goldsmith & habing 1969 ) . at temperatures of around 100 k , ionized 
 carbon and neutral oxygen cool the gas by collisions with neutral h , electrons , and , for oi , ionized h ( wolfire et al . 1995 ) . 
 these collisions are very strong coolants at temperatures near the energy levels of cii and oi , which are 94 k and 228 k , easily balancing the photoelectric heating rate that scales primarily with density . 
 thus the gas is thermally stable around 100 k. at lower temperatures , the cii and oi cooling transitions are barely excited , but the cooling rate does not drop much because the ci fine structure lines , which have lower excitation temperatures , become important coolants . thus the gas remains stable below 100 k too . at higher temperatures and lower densities with the same pressure , the collision rates and cooling rates decrease , leading to an unstable region until @xmath44k , at which point rapid cooling from ly@xmath45 emission and electron recombination onto grains 
 makes the gas stable again ( wolfire et al . 
 1995 ) . 
 figure [ fig : wolf ] shows the thermal pressure , heating and cooling rates , ionization fraction , temperature , and ionization parameter ( @xmath46 for radiation field @xmath47 scaled to the value in the solar neighborhood , temperature @xmath48 , and electron density @xmath49 ) for the `` standard '' model in wolfire et al . 
 ( 1995 ) . 
 the local coexistence of two stable thermal states should not apply everywhere in a disk galaxy . in the inner parts , where the pressure is very high and the ambient radiation field is only moderately high 
 , there may not be a warm atomic phase at all , and a high fraction of the atomic gas can be cool . 
 conversely , at large galactocentric radii , the pressure drops precipitously but the radiation field only a small amount , so there comes a point , at about 4 exponential scale lengths , where most of the hi becomes warm ( elmegreen & parravano 1994 ; braun 1997 ) . 
 local variations in the atomic state can arise because of variations in the radiation field and pressure . 
 these variations often follow a spiral density wave . 
 for example , most of the gas between the spiral arms is at low pressure , so it should be highly atomic , mostly diffuse , and warm . 
 a population of low - mass , self - gravitating molecular clouds typically remains as well , from the previous arm . 
 when this gas shocks to form a dust lane in the arm , the density and opacity to starlight go up in the atomic gas , the temperature drops , and the gas should turn molecular , even ultra - cold molecular . 
 but if massive star formation occurs inside or near this shocked gas , the enhanced radiation can warm it up again and dissociate it , forming a concentration of cool or warm hi near the resulting ob association , as observed in m83 ( allen , atherton & tilanus 1985 ; tilanus & allen 1993 ) , m51 ( tilanus & allen 1989 ) , m100 ( rand 1995 ) , and m81 ( allen et al . 1997 ) . 
 cold dense molecular material can coexist with this warm atomic gas if the molecules are in strongly self - gravitating clouds ; the gravity preserves their high density and self - shielding even in the presence of strong radiation fields . 
 the pressure , radiation field , and metallicity vary both systematically and randomly from place to place and time to time in any one galaxy , and from galaxy to galaxy along the hubble sequence . 
 what applies to the solar neighborhood will not generally apply elsewhere , and what typifies the milky way can be relatively rare in galaxies with different hubble types . 
 nevertheless , most of the variations that have been observed in other galaxies can be explained as a consequence of the simple rules given above . 
 the hotter phases of interstellar gas require local excess energy sources such as hot stars and supernovae . 
 these sources are relatively rare in a typical galactic disk ( not in a nuclear starburst disk , though ) , but each commands such a wide domain of influence that the locally heated regions can sometimes overlap with each other , making the hot gas pervasive ( cox & smith 1974 ; salpeter 1976 ; mckee & ostriker 1977 ) . 
 the domain of influence increases at lower density , so a single massive star at a large distance off the galactic plane can ionize a large volume in the halo . 
 for example , an o5 star in a gas with a halo - type density of 0.03 @xmath50 can ionize out to 3 kpc distance . 
 the origin of structure in interstellar gas is far less tangible than the origin of thermal and chemical states , because some of the structure is caused by supersonic turbulence , and no one understands yet how this works . 
 other structures , such as shells ( tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 ) and spiral shocks ( roberts 1969 ) , are somewhat easier to understand because they are regular and well defined . 
 turbulent structures , on the other hand , are irregular , boundary - free , and extremely intricate .    for example , a single molecular cloud , such as the orion cloud , probably contains a total number of dense tiny clumps and cloud pieces ( each with masses of @xmath51 m@xmath34 in the @xmath52 m@xmath34 orion cloud ) that exceeds the total number of all other orion - type clouds in all of the galaxies out to and including the virgo cluster ( considering @xmath53 orion - type clouds per spiral galaxy the size of the milky way ) . 
 obviously there are far too many pieces of structure in a typical molecular cloud to catalog or map at the present time , and far too many to simulate on a computer . 
 yet these tiny pieces are very important : they probably contain most of the mass in the cloud , as demonstrated by the generally high excitation densities for many molecular transitions ( e.g. , falgarone , phillips , & walker 1991 ; lada , evans & falgarone 1997 ) , and therefore control most of the chemistry , and ultimately , star formation 
 . how should we proceed to understand interstellar matter in the face of such complexity ( scalo 1990 ) ? 
 one of the most fundamental properties of turbulent clouds seems to be the arrangement of gas into hierarchical structures that are fractal or multi - fractal , with increasing density and local volume filling factor on smaller scales . 
 scale - free structures like this make a certain amount of sense for turbulent gas because the velocities that continuously form them have a scale - free nature as well , reminiscent of the kolmogorov velocity law in incompressible laboratory turbulence . 
 scale - free velocities should make scale - free structures , as long as thermal pressure and gravity are not important structuring agents as well . when gravity is important , the gas becomes centrally condensed and builds up a pressure gradient . 
 most star - forming clouds are centrally condensed already . 
 we would like to know whether non - linear gas motions ( i.e. `` turbulence '' ) with a magnetic field can produce structures and velocities similar to what is observed in space . 
 figure [ fig : sim ] shows one time step in a computer simulation of a supersonically turbulent , magnetic gas . the density is plotted as a grayscale , with two cycles of gray representing the span of density in the central `` cloudy '' region of a two - dimensional mhd simulation . 
 the initial conditions are a uniform density ( value 1 ) , and pressure ( value 1 , giving a sound speed of 5/3 ) , with a uniform magnetic field oriented vertically in the figure . 
 the initial alfven speed for this field is 10 in these units , which is supersonic . 
 there is no self - gravity . 
 the full grid measures 800 cells in the vertical direction , and 640 cells horizontally ( only the central 480 cells in the vertical direction are shown here ) . 
 after this initial setup , the magnetic field lines at the top and bottom of the grid are accelerated back and forth , horizontally , with random accelerations for random durations at random times , taking big swaths of field lines all at once . 
 the distribution of swath size is the same as we measured for the distribution of interstellar cloud sizes , namely a power law with @xmath54 ( elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ) . 
 what this result simulates is the non - linear excitation of field lines by moving neighboring clouds . 
 the gas in the simulation has two stable thermal states , one at a temperature corresponding to a sound speed of 1 , and another at a temperature corresponding to a sound speed of @xmath55 ( i.e. , 10 times hotter ) . 
 the magnetic field - line excitations at the top and bottom of the grid heat up the gas there to the high temperature state , and also drive the motion of gas toward the grid center . 
 this forms a dense `` cloud '' at the vertical center of the grid , and this cloud takes the cool thermal state . 
 the simulation was run for @xmath52 timesteps , with each time step equal to one - tenth of the time it takes an initial alfven wave to travel over a distance of one cell . 
 the figure shows the dense central part of the grid , measuring 640 cells horizontally and 480 cells vertically . 
 substructure inside the dense part is apparently hierarchical , with some `` clumps '' containing 4 levels of substructure . 
 the larger pieces move with a mildly supersonic speed , and last for about one sound crossing time ; during this time , they are `` bound '' by ram pressure from their constant motion . 
 that is , the @xmath56 term in the equation of motion acts like a binding pressure . 
 the thermal pressure is actually lower between the clumps than inside the clumps , so they are not bound by thermal pressure ; i.e. , there is no warm interclump medium . 
 simulations like these suggest that hierarchical structure is a natural consequence of non - linear magnetic wave interactions . 
 this gives an indication that perhaps turbulence is causing some of the structures seen in interstellar clouds . 
 we have a long way to go before the picture is complete . 
 optical images of galaxies like ours show such dominance by spiral arms that we should always question whether any local interstellar structures might have been caused by density waves . obviously , the string of giant molecular clouds along the sagittarius - carina arm , including the m17 and m16 clouds in the first quadrant , the eta carina cloud in the third quadrant , and many others ( e.g. , cohen et al . 1985 ) , should look like pieces in a giant spiral arm _ dust lane _ if viewed from outside the galaxy . there are probably streaming motions along this dustlane too . 
 spiral arm streaming motions ( roberts 1969 ) are well documented for other galaxies ( e.g. , kuno & nakai 1997 ) and for some regions in our galaxy , particularly along the tangent points of the inner spiral arms ( burton 1992 ) . 
 these streaming motions affect our estimates for the kinematic distances to molecular clouds . 
 for example , 
 the longitude and velocity of the m17 cloud , @xmath57 and @xmath58 km s@xmath59 , give it a kinematic distance of 2.5 kpc in the standard galactic rotation model . 
 but hanson , howarth & conti ( 1997 ) found a spectroscopic distance in the range of 1.1 to 1.7 kpc . at the preferred distance of 1.3 kpc 
 , its radial velocity should be only 10 km s@xmath59 . 
 this implies that the m17 molecular cloud has a streaming motion in the radial direction of @xmath60 km s@xmath59 , moving away from the sun . 
 this is consistent with the expected sense of spiral wave streaming , i.e. , directed radially inward along the arm inside corotation , or it corresponds to a purely azimuthal streaming of @xmath61 km s@xmath59 . 
 thus , the true streaming speed is somewhere between 10 and 30 km s@xmath59 . in any case 
 , the observed radial speed gives it a kinematic distance that is wrong by nearly a factor of 2 ! 
 such an error affects the mass estimate for m17 and other clouds as well as our perception of galactic spiral structure . 
 if turbulence makes some clouds and cloud clumps , then it also makes some of the low density regions between these clouds and clumps . 
 these are the spaces cleared out by the turbulent motions when the gas is moved into denser regions . for a fractal cloud population , 
 the intercloud medium has certain regular properties that also come from fractal geometry . 
 one of these properties is the size distribution of holes . in a hierarchical model with clumps inside other clumps , 
 each level in the hierarchy has a constant proportion of the number of empty regions of a particular size to the number of clumps of that size . 
 this means that the hole size distribution is the same as the clump size distribution , which is @xmath62 for size @xmath63 and fractal dimension @xmath64 ( mandelbrot 1982 ) . 
 the dimension for this type of fractal is defined by the relation @xmath65 for number of subclumps in a clump , @xmath16 , and for size ratio of clump to subclump @xmath66 . 
 it may also be defined from the scaling of mass with size @xmath67 . if @xmath68 from the cloud size distribution and mass - size relation ( elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ) , then the hole size distribution should be @xmath69 too . 
 the fractal brownian motion model proposed by stutzki et al . 
 ( 1998 ) also has a size distribution for clouds equal to the size distribution for holes . 
 this model begins with a white noise spectrum , and then convolves this with a power law that has decreasing power at high frequencies . 
 the result is a noise model with the large scale features emphasized . 
 these features , like the original noise , are equally likely to have positive or negative excursions around the mean density . 
 if we identify the positive excursions with clouds and cloud clumps and the negative excursions with holes between the clouds , then the size distribution for holes will be the same as the size distribution for clumps . 
 these predicted size distributions are steeper than the shell size distribution found by oey & clarke ( 1997 ) , who got a power law with a slope of @xmath70 ( instead of @xmath71 ) on a @xmath72 plot . 
 oey & clarke s objects are real shells , however , not just random regions with locally low densities . 
 there are no studies yet of the distribution of hole sizes , but consideration of this might prove fruitful . 
 the volume filling factor of low density gas is another important consideration for comparisons with observations . for the hierarchical fractal model discussed above 
 , the low density volume filling factor equals @xmath73 for density contrast @xmath74 between the highest and lowest levels ( elmegreen 1997 ) . to evaluate this , we used @xmath75 considering densities from 0.1 cm @xmath76 to 100 @xmath50 in the diffuse medium , or from 100 @xmath50 to @xmath52 @xmath50 in molecular clouds . 
 the large value of this filling factor indicates that _ a turbulent interstellar medium should be mostly empty , with most of the mass in the form of clouds that occupy only a small fraction of the volume_.    this result challenges the usual interpretation of the open frothy structure of the interstellar medium as an indication of stellar winds and supernovae ( brand & zealey 1975 ; hunter & gallagher 1990 ) . 
 more likely , the frothy structure is from a combination of these direct stellar processes plus pervasive turbulent motions . for the turbulent motions 
 , the energy can be put into the gas in non - explosive forms ( e.g. , shear , magnetic wave interactions , etc . ) , although some of it may ultimately come from explosions around stars too . a recent fractal interpretation of the frothy structure in hi maps of the smc 
 was made by stanimirovic et al . 
 ( 1998 ) . 
 equation [ eq : ficm ] gives the total filling factor of low density gas from all levels in the hierarchy . 
 there is another filling factor for a hierarchical cloud distribution and that is the filling factor of regions with a certain average gas density , @xmath77 , @xmath78\right ) d\log s \propto { { 1}\over{<\rho>}}d\log < \rho>. \label{eq : fave}\ ] ] this result 
 is easily derived using the intermediate step shown , along with the size distribution function @xmath79 and the density - size relation @xmath80 , which comes from the mass - size relation that defines the fractal dimension @xmath64 in this model , @xmath67 . 
 equation [ eq : fave ] indicates that the summed volume of regions with a certain average density occupies a smaller and smaller fraction of the total volume as that density increases . 
 equation [ eq : ficm ] above suggests further that as this average density increases ( and @xmath81 ) , the gas inside each dense piece becomes more and more uniform . 
 thus we recover the standard model of _ interstellar clouds composed of numerous , tiny , near - uniform clumps , arranged in a fractal pattern with the average gas density varying inversely with size _ ( for @xmath64 near 2 ) . 
 we also get an explanation for the common perception that clumps in emission line surveys generally occupy 110% of the volume ( e.g. , blitz 1993 ) . evidently , this is a selection effect caused by the limitations of molecular emission maps which are typically sensitive to only a factor of @xmath82 range in density for any one survey . 
 berkhuijsen ( 1998 ) has obtained a remarkable result recently in plotting the volume filling factor of ionized interstellar gas as a function of its local average density . 
 the result , shown in figure [ fig : berk ] , is a @xmath83 distribution , as expected for a turbulent fluid with any fractal dimension . 
 this does not mean that the ionized fluid itself is turbulent in this way ; in most regions , the ionization structure is probably just a reflection of the neutral structure of the gas before it was ionized . 
 hierarchical or fractal structure in the intestellar medium implies that clouds are highly clumped , i.e. , that any one cloud is likely to have another cloud nearby , and , conversely , any empty region is not particularly likely to have a cloud nearby . 
 such clumping makes the mean free path for intersecting a cloud on the line of sight different for regions near clouds than for regions between clouds . 
 thus the _ intercloud _ mean free path can be larger than the _ average _ mean free , which has always been obtained in the past by assuming a uniform density . 
 this result has important implications for the distance ionizing photons can travel once they leave a molecular cloud / ob association complex . 
 the mean free path is generally defined as @xmath84 for number density of clouds @xmath32 and cross sectional area @xmath85 . 
 when @xmath32 is not uniform , but clumped instead , this expression has a different value on lines of sight near cloud complexes than it does on lines of sight between cloud complexes . 
 the hierarchical cloud model discussed above ( elmegreen 1997 ) can be used to show that the number of sub - clouds on a line of sight through a fractal cloud is @xmath86 if there are 8 interstellar absorption lines kpc@xmath59 on _ average _ ( blaauw 1952 ) , then these correspond to @xmath87 fractal cloud complexes per kiloparsec . 
 indeed , most of the local gas is not randomly distributed with a constant space density of clouds everywhere . 
 it is highly clumped into cloud complexes associated with the ob associations in orion , sco - cen , and perseus , and with the taurus clouds . 
 these are the types of clouds that occur with the rate of 3 kpc@xmath59 . 
 the average mean free path on lines of sight _ between _ the fractal cloud complexes should be @xmath88 pc . 
 this may be defined as the pure intercloud mean free path . 
 it exceeds the galactic scale height , which means that once photons get into the disk intercloud medium , they are likely to reach the halo . for this reason , the ionization of the halo , giving the `` reynolds '' layer ( reynolds 1995 ) , may be much easier than previously thought ( compare this result to the uniform cloud model by miller & cox 1993 ) . 
 hii regions expand away from giant molecular clouds into the intercloud medium . for fractal clouds , 
 the neutral density varies inversely with distance @xmath20 as @xmath89 for @xmath68 . 
 when the ionization front reaches this neutral density , it heats and ionizes the gas , causing the smallest pieces to expand and mix with each other . 
 this makes the local density more uniform on a timescale equal to the sound crossing time for the small pieces , but it does not affect the overall density gradient much because the sound crossing time is large on a large scale . thus a young hii region should have a radial density gradient reflecting the @xmath90 gradient in the initial neutral cloud . as a result 
 , there should be an extended component of _ diffuse ionized gas _ surrounding most hii regions . 
 the fraction of the ionization outside the conventional strmgren sphere can be large , perhaps 50% ( elmegreen 1997 ) . 
 such extended ionization around hii regions presumably corresponds to the observations of diffuse ionized gas in our galaxy ( reynolds 1995 ) and other galaxies ( walterbos & braun 1994 ; ferguson et al . 
 this diffuse ionized gas is clearly associated with the outlying parts of individual hii regions in many cases ( walterbos & braun 1994 ) . 
 the mass distribution of purely hierarchical structures should scale as @xmath91 constant , or ( fleck 1996 ) : @xmath92 actually , @xmath93 from clump surveys ( stutzki et al . 
 1998 ; heithausen et al . 
 1998 ) . 
 elmegreen & falgarone ( 1997 ) got @xmath94 with @xmath95 from a model of hierarchical cloud structure using the observed @xmath96 for size @xmath63 with @xmath97 , and the observed @xmath98 with @xmath99 , and then combining these relations with the standard conversion @xmath100 , which gives @xmath101 . 
 stutzki et al . 
 ( 1998 ) got @xmath102 with a cloud model based on fractal brownian motion , using @xmath103 and the same @xmath64 and @xmath104 . 
 the physical difference between these two models is that hierarchical clouds have all their small clumps inside larger clumps , whereas fractal brownian motion clouds have small structure with equal probability everywhere , although it is weaker outside the larger clumps . in theory 
 , the brownian motion model makes more sense for turbulence , which should have some density structure everywhere , but in practice , the low density regions outside of the main hierarchy in an interstellar cloud may be ionized or invisible in co , in which case only the dense hierarchical core , which is common to both models , will be seen . 
 the @xmath105 function also applies to the probability of choosing part of a hierarchical cloud from any level . 
 if stars form at all levels in a hierarchy because all levels have dense gas in tiny clumps , then the resulting stars will be hierarchically clumped too . 
 such a distribution for stars is in fact commonly observed ( elmegreen & efremov 1997 , 1998 ) . if , in addition , bound clusters form with some high and nearly constant efficiency , so @xmath106 , then the mass distribution for star 
 _ clusters _ will be about the same as the mass distribution for cloud structure ( elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ) .    battinelli et al . 
 ( 1994 ) found cluster mass functions from two samples that had power law slopes equal to @xmath107 and @xmath108 . 
 elmegreen & efremov ( 1997 ) similarly found @xmath109 for three different age groups in the lmc . 
 these cluster mass functions are very similar to the expectations from hierarchical clouds , given by equation [ eq : fleck ] .

 interstellar structure that is hierarchical or fractal in the cloudy parts and has large and connected empty regions between these clouds is probably the result of turbulence .

81,"it has long been known that there is an @xmath0 supermultiplet which , with respect to @xmath1 supersymmetry , appears as a combination of one vector and one chiral multiplet @xcite . 
 this supermultiplet is irreducible under @xmath0 supersymmetry and carries vanishing central charge . 
 it is usually referred to as the vector supermultiplet . 
 not long after its introduction , it was realized that there exists a variant , the vector - tensor multiplet , which , under @xmath1 supersymmetry , appears as a combination of one vector and one linear multiplet @xcite . 
 this variant is irreducible under @xmath0 and , in contrast , carries non - vanishing central charge off - shell . on shell 
 it is equivalent to the vector multiplet . 
 this multiplet was originally constructed using component field techniques @xcite , and it and its properties have received little attention . recently , however , within the context of trying to understand the consequences of @xmath0 duality in superstrings , the vector - tensor multiplet has re - emerged . specifically , when heterotic string theory is reduced to an @xmath0 theory in four dimensions the dilaton and the antisymmetric tensor field lie in a vector - tensor multiplet @xcite . 
 it is clear from this work that the vector - tensor supermultiplet is fundamental in heterotic theories and that elucidation of its properties , such as its behavior under duality transformations , is of importance . 
 the coupling of the vector - tensor multiplet to supergravity has also recently been considered @xcite . 
 it was shown that this requires the gauging of the central charge , leading to a chern - simons coupling between the vector - tensor multiplet and a vector multiplet . 
 if one wants to fully understand the complete , off - shell structure of the tensor - vector multiplet , one powerful approach is to construct the appropriate @xmath0 superfield . 
 it is the purpose of this paper to provide such a formulation . 
 much of the interesting structure of the vector - tensor multiplet appears in its couplings to other multiplets @xcite . here , however , we will restrict ourselves to a superfield formulation of the free abelian case , leaving interacting generalization to future publications . 
 since the vector - tensor supermultiplet has non - zero central charge , it is necessary to expand the usual superspace . 
 the maximal central extension of the @xmath0 superalgebra has two central charges . 
 consequently the corresponding superspace has two extra bosonic coordinates @xcite . 
 working in this superspace , one can introduce superfields and covariant constraints . 
 following the geometrical formulation of supergauge fields , we introduce a super - connection and the associated curvature . 
 we then introduce the appropriate constraints , solve the bianchi identities and show how the component fields of the tensor - vector multiplet emerge . using superspace techniques we rederive the supersymmetry and central charge transformations and , after showing that there exist a lagrangian superfield in central charge superspace , the higher components of which are all total derivatives 
 , we give the superfield and component actions . 
 the existence of a superfield lagrangian is an example of a central - charge generalization of the superactions described in @xcite . 
 it suggests that there is an even - dimensional submanifold of the central charge superspace naturally associated with the vector - tensor multiplet . 
 central charge superspace has recently also been considered in @xcite and used to rederive the usual gauge supermultiplet . 
 also , we want to point out that there is a strong relationship between the theory of @xmath1 supersymmetry in six dimensions and four - dimensional , @xmath0 central charge superspace . indeed , the superfield equations of motion in the six - dimensional theory motivated the choice of one important constraint equation in four - dimensional central charge superspace . 
 in this sense , our constraint can be understood as a superfield realization of the dimensional reduction by legendre transformation discussed in @xcite . 
 we start by briefly recapitulating the relevant formulae of @xmath0 superspace . throughout the paper 
 we will use the conventions of @xcite . 
 the @xmath0 supersymmetry algebra is obtained from the poincar algebra by adding four fermionic operators @xmath2 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and their anti - hermitian conjugates @xmath5 . 
 moreover the algebra admits one complex `` central charge '' @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are hermitian . 
 these operators satisfy the following anticommutation relations : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the four - momenta and @xmath11 . 
 the automorphism group of algebra is @xmath12 where the @xmath13 acts on the @xmath14 index in @xmath2 . 
 the antisymmetric tensor @xmath15 with @xmath16 provides an invariant metric for raising and lowering the @xmath13 indices by @xmath17 and @xmath18 . 
 @xmath0 superspace is a space with coordinates @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are commuting bosonic coordinates while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are anticommuting fermionic coordinates . 
 a superfield @xmath25 is a function of the superspace coordinates , @xmath26 . 
 taylor - series expansion of a general superfield @xmath25 in the @xmath27 coordinates terminates after a finite number of terms due to the anticommuting nature of @xmath27 . on the other hand 
 , the expansion in @xmath21 and @xmath28 never ends . 
 this means there are an infinite number of component fields ( functions of the spacetime coordinates @xmath20 ) in a general superfield . 
 this infinite number of component fields can be reduced to a finite number either off - shell , by applying appropriate constraints , or on - shell , by choosing equations of motion which propagate only a finite number of component fields . 
 translations in the superspace are generated by the supercovariant differential operators @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 where @xmath33 . 
 it is straightforward to compute the anticommutation relations for these operators . 
 they are @xmath34 by construction @xmath35 and @xmath36 anticommute with @xmath37 and @xmath38 and so can be used to impose supersymmetric covariant conditions on superfields . 
 the supervielbein @xmath39 of the @xmath0 superspace is defined as the matrix that relates the supercovariant derivatives @xmath40 and the ordinary partial derivatives @xmath41 the matrix @xmath42 is the inverse of @xmath39 . 
 these two matrices define the geometry of the @xmath0 superspace . 
 the torsion @xmath43 is defined as the exterior derivative of the supervielbein one - form @xmath44 , @xmath45 the non - vanishing components of the torsion are found to be @xmath46 
 in this section we give a geometrical superfield formulation of the vector - tensor multiplet . 
 we begin by considering the usual geometrical form of super - gauge theory , though in superspace with central charge . 
 we then find a suitable set of constraints on the superfield strength to reproduce the field content of the vector - tensor multiplet . 
 restricting our attention to abelian gauge theories , let us introduce a hermitian connection @xmath47 . 
 the hermiticity of the connection implies @xmath48 where @xmath49 is real , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . 
 the curvature two - form is defined as @xmath52 the coefficient functions @xmath53 comprise thirteen lorentz - covariant types . 
 the ones that contain torsion terms are given by @xmath54 the curvature tensor @xmath55 is subject to the bianchi identities @xmath56 or equivalently @xmath57 each tensor component of the curvature tensor is an @xmath0 superfield which , in turn , has an infinite number of component fields . 
 all but a finite number of these component fields must be eliminated by virtue of appropriate constraints . 
 these constraints must be lorentz , gauge , and supersymmetric covariant . 
 it is natural to adopt a set of constraints which set the pure spinorial part of the curvature tensor to zero . that is @xmath58 before imposing further conditions 
 we would like to explore the consequences of . to do so we must solve the bianchi identities subject to these constraints . 
 the result is that all the components of the curvature tensor @xmath59 are determined in terms of a single superfield @xmath60 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath61 . 
 henceforth , we denote these superfields by @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in particular @xmath64 and @xmath65 furthermore , @xmath62 is constrained to satisfy @xmath66 }   = - \epsilon^{\dot\alpha\dot\beta } \bar d_{\dot\alpha}^{[i } \bar   w_{\dot\beta}^{j ] } , \label{3 } \\ & \epsilon^{\alpha\beta } d_\alpha^{(i } w_\beta^{j ) }   = \epsilon^{\dot\alpha\dot\beta } \bar d_{\dot\alpha}^{(i } \bar   w_{\dot\beta}^{j)}. \label{4}\end{aligned}\ ] ] let us explore the consequences of  on the field content of @xmath62 . 
 the expansion of @xmath62 in the anti - commuting coordinates has the general form @xmath67 it is obvious that conditions  will not impose any restriction on @xmath68 . 
 first we consider the implications of the lowest component of superfield constraints . condition implies that @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 . 
 conditions and further implies the reality condition @xmath72 and @xmath73 where @xmath74 . 
 condition yields @xmath75 higher components of the superfield constraint 
 imply further conditions on the fields @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . one way to realize these conditions is to note that , from equations , , and , @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 . 
 the equations  are the general solution of the bianchi identities subject to our constraints . 
 three of the bianchi identities they satisfy are @xmath82 taking the lowest component of equation gives rise to @xmath83 so that @xmath84 is the field strength of a gauge field @xmath85 . 
 that is @xmath86 the lowest components of and give @xmath87 } & = - \tfrac12 ( \partial_z + \partial_{\bar z } )   \mathscript f_{ab } , \\ \partial_{[a } h^i_{b ] } & = - \tfrac12 i ( \partial_z-\partial_{\bar z } )   \mathscript f_{ab } , \label{h1 } \\ 
 \partial_a d & = - \tfrac14 i \left\ { ( \partial_z-\partial_{\bar z } )   h_a^r   + i ( \partial_z + \partial_{\bar z } ) h_a^i \right\ } , \label{temp11}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath88 . 
 this is as far as we can go using solely the constraints . 
 so far we have the following component fields : an @xmath13 doublet of spinors @xmath89 , a real gauge field @xmath85 , a complex vector field @xmath90 , a real scalar @xmath78 and a real @xmath13 triplet of scalars @xmath91 . 
 we would like to impose further constraints to reduce the number of fields to an irreducible multiplet . 
 as we will show very shortly , it is possible to impose further constraints to ensure that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath90 are each field strengths , one of an anti - symmetric tensor and the other of a scalar . 
 what about the fields @xmath78 and @xmath91 ? 
 we will find that @xmath78 and @xmath91 play the role of auxiliary fields . 
 note that the usual @xmath0 gauge multiplet has a triplet of auxiliary fields . 
 hence , if we want to derive the usual gauge multiplet we are led to set @xmath78 to zero by promoting the constraint to the stronger one @xmath92 } = 0 , \qquad    \epsilon^{\dot\alpha\dot\beta } \bar d_{\dot\alpha}^{[i } \bar   w_{\dot\beta}^{j ] } = 0.\ ] ] on the other hand , if we want to derive the vector - tensor multiplet , which has a single auxiliary field , we must eliminate @xmath91 . 
 this can be achieved by promoting condition to the stronger condition @xmath93 henceforth , we add condition as a further constraint on the theory . 
 now let us proceed using conditions  as well as the stronger version of , constraint . 
 apart from eliminating @xmath91 , it can be shown that the consequences of imposing are @xmath94 we note that the conditions obtained so far on @xmath90 given in and are not sufficient to render the real and imaginary components of @xmath90 as field strengths . 
 we would like , therefore , to impose yet another , and final , constraint that will achieve this goal . 
 we take a reality condition on the central charge @xmath95 this means that superfield @xmath62 , and hence all the curvature tensor components , depend on the two central charges @xmath21 and @xmath96 only through the combination @xmath97 with no dependence on @xmath98 . 
 substituting from constraint into and immediately gives the following constraints on the real and imaginary components of @xmath90 @xmath99}^i = 0 . \label{t5}\ ] ] these equations achieve just the goal we were aiming for . 
 they assert that @xmath100 and @xmath101 are field strengths of an anti - symmetric tensor and a scalar field respectively . 
 that is @xmath102 in conclusion , we find that the component fields in @xmath62 are exactly those of the vector - tensor multiplet , namely @xmath103 . it will not have escaped the readers notice that these fields are actually functions of the central charge coordinates as well as the spacetime coordinates . however , by virtue of constraint , they depend on the central charge coordinates only via @xmath104 . 
 let us introduce a real central charge coordinate @xmath105 . 
 moreover , the dependence of these fields on @xmath106 is highly restricted by the conditions we derived so far . 
 in fact , as we now show , these conditions completely determine their dependence on @xmath106 in terms of their lowest component in their central charge expansion . to see this 
 let us summarize the relevant conditions in , , and derived on the bosonic fields . 
 they are @xmath107}^r . \end{split } \label{t4}\ ] ] equations constitute a system of first - order `` differential equations '' for the @xmath108 dependence of the bosonic fields . 
 the general solution is completely determined in terms of the `` initial conditions '' ; that is , the values of the fields at @xmath109 , say , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 . 
 thus in a taylor series expansion in @xmath106 each term in the series gets related to lower - order terms , so that for instance , @xmath113 with similar formulas for @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath84 . 
 furthermore , in the next section , we will derive the corresponding equation for the fermionic field @xmath68 . 
 in this section , we would like to derive the supersymmetry and central charge transformations of the component fields . in order to exhibit these transformations 
 it is necessary to compute the part of @xmath62 quadratic in the fermionic coordinates . 
 moreover , since all the component fields are present in the lowest and first order terms of @xmath62 , the quadratic term is sufficient for computing the supersymmetry transformations . 
 we have @xmath114 let us first consider the constraint equations , , and . 
 demanding that the linear term in @xmath27 in these equations vanish completely determines @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 . 
 we find @xmath118 we note that these terms do not involve any new fields . 
 they are completely given in terms of the lowest component of @xmath62 , namely @xmath68 . 
 we are still left with equation which is a reality condition . evaluating the linear term in , and making use of , yields the following constraint on the fermionic field @xmath68 @xmath119 where @xmath120 . 
 equation is the relation for the fermionic field @xmath121 corresponding to equations for the bosonic fields . 
 it fixes the expansion of @xmath68 in the central charge @xmath106 , leaving only the lowest component @xmath122 arbitrary . 
 we are now in a position to compute the supersymmetry transformation of the different component fields . 
 to do this we have to act on @xmath62 with @xmath123 we find @xmath124 }   + 2 \xi_\alpha^i d   + \tfrac{i}{3 } \bar\xi^{\dot\alpha i } { { \smash{{\sigma}^{a}}_{\alpha\dot\alpha } } }   \epsilon_{abcd } \partial^b b^{cd } - 2 { { \smash{{\sigma}^{a}}_{\alpha\dot\alpha } } }   \bar\xi^{\dot\alpha } \partial_a \phi . \end{split } \label{susy}\ ] ] note that the fields in these supersymmetry transformations are formally functions of both @xmath20 and @xmath106 . 
 we have already shown that the only independent components of these fields are the lowest order terms in @xmath106 . 
 further , transformations do not mix component fields from different orders in @xmath106 . 
 thus equations also express the variations of the lowest - order independent fields , which are functions of @xmath20 only .    to get the central charge transformations we have to act with @xmath125 on @xmath62 . 
 it is straightforward to get the following set of transformations @xmath126 expressions and reproduce the supersymmetry and central charge transformations of the vector - tensor multiplet given in the component field calculations of @xcite . 
 they are a realization of the @xmath0 supersymmetry algebra with central charge . 
 note that as a result of our constraints , in particular , only one of the two central charges is represented nontrivially . 
 we now discuss how to write a superfield action for the vector - tensor multiplet . 
 we start by noting that the relevant field strengths of the different bosonic fields occur at the linear level in @xmath62 . to get a quadratic expression in these field strengths 
 , we have to consider expressions quadratic in @xmath62 . 
 these expressions can contain both @xmath35 and @xmath36 . 
 contracting the indices to get a proper lorentz invariant lagrangian implies that there must be an even number of @xmath78 s . 
 in such an expression , the relevant terms will occur at @xmath127 level if it involves no derivatives or the lowest component if it involves two derivatives . in the former case we will have to integrate over two @xmath27 s only . 
 but in contrast to the chiral space for @xmath1 supersymmetry , there is no two - dimensional subspace of the @xmath0 superspace over which supersymmetry is represented . 
 hence , we are forced to consider expressions quadratic in @xmath62 with two supersymmetric covariant derivatives , and to integrate over spacetime only . 
 in fact , we find that the free lagrangian for all the component fields is contained in the lowest component of @xmath128 to be precise , we have @xmath129 it is straightforward to verify that lagrangian is invariant under supersymmetry transformations up to a total divergence . 
 although this implies that it must be invariant under central charge transformation as well , since the latter is equivalent to two successive supersymmetry transformations , one can check directly that it is indeed invariant under up to a total divergence . 
 this invariance of the lowest component of the lagrangian under central charge and supersymmetry transformations , in fact , implies that the higher components are spacetime total divergences . to show this 
 let us consider first the invariance under central charge transformation . since the lagrangian transforms by a total divergence under a single central charge transformation , it must does so under @xmath130 such transformations . 
 that is @xmath131 put another way , all the coefficients in the @xmath106 expansion of @xmath132 but the lowest one are , in fact , spacetime total divergences . 
 therefore we have @xmath133 although a little involved we can extend this proof to the expansion in @xmath27 as well . 
 that is , it can be shown that @xmath134 we would like to stress that this is completely general . 
 if the lowest component of a superfield is supersymmetric invariant up to a spacetime total divergence , all the higher components in @xmath106 as well as @xmath27 are spacetime total divergences . 
 this has the immediate consequence that a spacetime integral of this superfield will single out the lowest component . in other words 
 we can write down the following superfield expression for the invariant action @xmath135 this represents a central charge generalization of the type of superactions considered in @xcite . 
 this completes our study of the superfield formulation of the vector - tensor multiplet . 
 we conclude by briefly mentioning the connection between the superspace formulation of the vector - tensor multiplet and @xmath1 supersymmetry in six dimensions . the presence of central charge led us to augment @xmath0 superspace by two new bosonic coordinates , @xmath21 and @xmath96 . 
 the resulting space , with six bosonic coordinates , is actually none - other than the superspace of @xmath1 supersymmetry in six dimensions ( though with the fermionic coordinates treated slightly unconventionally , being formulated as a pair of @xmath13 majorana - weyl spinors @xcite ) . 
 the introduction of a connection @xmath136 in the central charge superspace then mirrors the formulation of supersymmetric gauge theory in six dimensions . 
 in fact our first set of constraints are precisely those used for the six - dimensional vector multiplet @xcite . to obtain the vector - tensor multiplet we imposed two further constraints . 
 the first condition still has a six - dimensional interpretation : it corresponds to the on - shell condition for the six- dimensional vector multiplet . 
 it is important to note that this does not imply that the multiplet is on - shell in four - dimensions . 
 instead it implies a relationship between the derivatives of the component fields in the internal @xmath21@xmath137 directions and in the four - dimensional @xmath138 directions , as shown in equation . 
 the second condition breaks the six - dimensional lorentz symmetry . 
 it forces the superfield to be independent of one of the internal @xmath21@xmath137 directions . 
 as we have shown , together these conditions are sufficient to completely determine the dependence of the multiplet on the central charge coordinates . 
 the connection to the component formulation of the vector - tensor multiplet given by sohnius _ 
 @xcite now also becomes clear . 
 the second condition is a conventional dimensional reduction of the six- dimensional vector multiplet down to five - dimensions . 
 the first condition , corresponding to an on - shell condition in six- dimensions , reproduces the `` dimensional reduction by legendre transform '' from five to four dimensions . 
 a superspace formulation of the vector - tensor multiplet allows a number of further issues to be addressed . 
 first is the question of duality . on shell , the usual vector multiplet and the vector - tensor multiplet 
 describe the same degrees of freedom . from the @xmath1 point of view , one is the dual of the other since the chiral multiplet in the usual vector multiplet is dual to the tensor multiplet in the vector - tensor multiplet . 
 central charge superspace should provide a realization of this duality in a manifestly @xmath0 supersymmetric way . 
 a related question is to find an unconstrained @xmath0 prepotential for the vector - tensor multiplet . 
 we also note that the form of the multiplet described here has been explicitly non - interacting . 
 however , the superspace formalism also allows the description of non - abelian multiplets as well as multiplets with gauged central charge and chern - simons terms as have been discussed in components in @xcite . 
 it is also pertinent to the discussion of the most general form of the action for the vector - tensor multiplet . 
 finally the central charge superspace can be used to give a superfield description of other exotic @xmath0 multiplets , in particular the tensor and double - tensor multiplets mentioned in @xcite . 
 we leave the discussion of these issues to future publications .

82,"the statistical toolkit @xcite was originally conceived as a statistical data analysis toolkit for the problem of comparing data distributions . 
 its development follows the unified software development process @xcite . according to this approach , the life - cycle of the software is iterative - incremental , every iteration representing an evolution , an improvement , an extension in comparison with the previous one . 
 iterations in the statistical toolkit development process are driven by the needs of its experimental applications ; practical use cases steer the implementations of new tests . 
 the first development cycles of the statistical toolkit implemented a set of goodness - of - fit ( gof ) tests for the two - sample problem , i.e. for the comparison of two distributions . 
 these developments were motivated by experimental requirements for regression testing , validation of simulation with respect to experimental data , comparison of expected versus reconstructed distributions , and more in general for the comparison of data from different sources . 
 new requirements have been identified , based on the experience of using the statistical toolkit in several analyses for the validation of geant4 physics models . 
 these projects highlighted the need for complementary functionality , beyond the problem of assessing the compatibility of two distributions . 
 one of the problems faced in simulation validation ( and , more in general , in the comparison of experimental distributions ) , consists in the identification of possible systematic effects : tests of randomness address this requirement . 
 another problem encountered in the experience with the simulation validation consists of the comparison not only of individual data distributions , but also of categories ( e.g. the evaluation of differences in the behaviour of two geant4 physics models with respect to a set of experimental test cases ) . 
 goodness - of - fit tests quantify the compatibility of the agreement between a set of sample observations and the the corresponding values predicted from some model of interest , or between two ( or more ) sets of observations . 
 the result of a goodness - of - fit test is expressed through a @xmath0-value , which represents the probability that the test statistic has a value at least as extreme as that observed , assuming the null hypothesis is true . 
 the collection of tests implemented in the current version of the statistical toolkit is given in table [ old_tests ] ; extensive details can be found in @xcite .

 an effort has been invested to provide an effective software development environment , which exploits more modern tools and facilitates the use of the statistical toolkit in a variety of computing environments .    for the new development cycle subversion ( svn ) 
 @xcite has been selected as a tool in support of the configuration and change management discipline . 
 the statistical toolkit code was moved to a svn repository .    in order to facilitate using the statistical toolkit on a wide variety of operating systems , 
 the build system has been moved to the cross platform make ( cmake ) @xcite system . 
 the ` ctest ` testing tool , distributed as a part of cmake , is used for unit testing .    to be as self - consistent as possible , 
 the number of dependencies on external software systems has been minimized . 
 the only essential external dependency is on the gnu scientific library @xcite . 
 an additional user layer was implemented to facilitate the use of the statistical toolkit in analysis environment that are concerned neither with aida @xcite nor with root @xcite analysis objects , which are supported by the two user layers available in the current version . 
 the new user layer allows the analyst to supply input data to the statistical toolkit in the form of comma - separated lists of values ( csv ascii files ) . 
 if no external dependencies are specified , this user layer is built by default . 
 otherwise , in properly set - up environments aida or root ( or both ) are found by ` cmake`and the corresponding user layer is built automatically . 
 the statistical toolkit comes with an extensive set of ` unittests ` , which are meant to test the correct implementation of the statistical tests for each new version of the statistical toolkit . 
 the new development cycle extends the functionality of the statistical toolkit with tests for randomness , one sample goodness - of - fit tests , i.e. comparing data to reference functions , and tests for categorical data . 
 table [ new_tests ] lists the new tests .

 chi2curvescomparisonalgorithm ` +      randomness tests provide complementary information to the existing goodness of fit tests ( table [ old_tests ] ) : for instance , tests for randomness can highlight the presence of systematic effects in the distributions subject to comparison , which goodness of fit tests can not detect . 
 a use case is illustrated in @xcite : goodness of fit tests confirm the compatibility of various geant4 proton elastic scattering models respect to reference data , nevertheless asymmetries in the distribution of differences between the results of the simulation and reference data hint to the presence of systematic effects associated with some of the geant4 physics models . 
 the runs tests are statistical tests , used to test the hypothesis that the elements of the sequence are mutually independent or whether the data have some pattern . 
 a run is defined as a series of values of the same type ( e.g. series of increasing / decreasing values , series of true / false values , etc ) , the number of consequent values of the same type being the length of the run .    as an example consider tossing a coin and noting the outcome , which is either head ( @xmath5 ) or tail ( @xmath6 ) . 
 a run in this example is each sequence of the same type of outcome . 
 both too many runs ( as in case of cyclic pattern @xmath7 , which has the maximum possible number of runs for given number of observations ) and too few runs ( where heads and tails are clustered together @xmath8 ) exhibit evidence of a non - random relationship between the order of the experiments and the outcome . 
 the wald - wolfowitz test from @xcite is the best known test that is based on the number of runs . 
 it has been proposed as a test of whether two samples are from the same population , but as such has poor power @xcite and the mann - whitney test is preferable . 
 the new version of the statistical toolkit ( to be released ) encompasses implementations of the the wald - wolfowitz runs test for one or two samples . when the test is used with two samples , the algorithm in @xcite is used to construct one ( binary ) sample , and results from the test for one sample are returned .    to calculate the @xmath0-values , either the exact or an approximated formula 
 can be used . 
 the exact calculation of the two - tailed probability of the test statistics implemented in the statistical toolkit follows the description from @xcite , while the approximated formula takes into account that for large samples the distribution of the number of runs approaches a normal distribution . 
 wilcoxon @xcite published a test for comparison of two samples , based on comparison of the general size of the two samples , ranking of the ( combined ) samples and then comparing the average ranks of separate ranks . 
 the developments of the test followed fast and the first to publish it were mann and whitney @xcite . 
 the new version of the statistical toolkit implements the mann - whitney @xmath1 test and an approximated formula for the @xmath0-value calculation , again assuming that the samples are large , hence the distribution of the ranks can be described with a normal distribution . 
 categorical data analysis involves testing the significance of the association ( contingency ) between the groups . in practice 
 the number of categories is usually small ( below 20 ) , although in principle the tests for categorical data could be used for any number of groups . 
 the difference between the observed and the expected data , considering the given marginal and the assumptions of the model of independence , can be calculated using the @xmath3 test ( already available in the statistical toolkit ) ; however , the @xmath3 test gives only an estimate of the true probability value . 
 the estimate might be inaccurate in case the marginal is very uneven or if there is a small value ( less than five ) in one of the cells of the contingency table . 
 fisher s exact test for contingency tables @xcite is most widely known exact test for categorical data analysis . 
 it is calculated by generating all tables that are more extreme than the table given by the user . to get the two - tailed @xmath0-value 
 , the @xmath0-values of the tables that have @xmath0-values of the same size or smaller than the data table probability are added up to form the cumulative @xmath0-value , including the @xmath0-value of the data table itself . 
 this method becomes computationally intensive already for moderately sized tables , since the number of table probabilities to be enumerated can easily reach billions . 
 fisher s exact test for @xmath2 contingency tables is available in the new development version of the statistical toolkit . 
 an algorithm to calculate the @xmath3 test with yates continuity correction has also been implemented as part of the new development cycle . 
 the @xmath3 tests can be applied to general ( @xmath4 ) contingency tables , while due to computational reasons fisher s exact test is only implemented for @xmath9 tables . 
 the new development cycle of the statistical toolkit comes with a more versatile build system and provides the user significant extensions in testing capabilities . 
 the new tests extend the statistical toolkit capabilities with tests for randomness and tests for categorical data analysis . 
 the new user layer component makes it possible to use the toolkit with many spreadsheet applications that allow exporting data directly to comma separated list of values . 
 new tests , together with the new user layer , make the statistical toolkit a powerful data analysis tool for experimental physics problems concerned with data comparisons .

83,"cognitive radio ( cr ) has been an important research area for its superiority in spectrum efficiency . 
 generally , there are two categories in cr transmissions : underlay and overlay . in the underlay mode 
 , the primary users ( pus ) and the secondary users ( sus ) can transmit in the same spectrum simultaneously with the guarantee that the sus transmissions should not affect the pus to a certain extent ( e.g. , the interference - signal - ratio at the pus should not exceed some constant ) . in the overlay mode , the sus sense the spectrum holes  that the pus do not utilize periodically , and then transmit through these holes . 
 recently , green ( i.e. , energy - saving and co2 emission reduction ) transmission becomes a vital consideration in communications system design due to severe energy shortage and environmental problems . under this circumstances , renewable energy , e.g. , solar , 
 has been introduced into wireless communications . 
 renewable energy or energy harvestingaided wireless communications becomes a hot research topic@xcite-@xcite . 
 especially , the renewable energy aided cr network gains much interest because of its assemblage of spectrum efficiency and green energy advantages ( e.g. , eco - efficiency and potential energy - efficiency)@xcite . in @xcite , 
 an upper bound on the theoretical achievable throughput of energy harvesting su has been obtained under overlay mode . in @xcite , 
 the harvesting - sensing - throughput  tradeoff is investigated for energy harvesting cr . 
 an optimal single - slot spectrum sensing strategy for throughput optimization has been proposed . in @xcite , a hybrid underlay - overlay cognitive radio with energy harvesting 
 is considered , and an access strategy for maximizing the long - term throughput of the system is derived by applying the partially observable markov decision process framework . in @xcite , 
 a renewable energy aided cooperative cr system , where su receives unsuccessful packets transmitted by pu and relays them to pu rx , is considered . 
 the stable throughput region is analyzed . in @xcite , 
 the robust optimization is performed for energy harvesting cr with the channel and energy harvesting uncertainties .    in the paper 
 , we investigate a renewable energy powered cr , where a pu shares spectrum with an su . 
 the pu transmits with constant power . 
 the su transmitter ( tx ) is equipped with an energy harvester ( e.g. , a photovoltaic ) , and the harvested renewable energy is stored in a battery before usage . 
 the generated data from application layer of the su tx is stored in a first - in - first - out ( fifo ) data buffer . in each transmission slot , the su tx allocates the stored renewable energy for transmitting some data to the su rx . to guarantee the pu s transmission qos , 
 the isr at the pu rx should be less than a threshold ( i.e. , the su tx s transmitting power is constrained in each slot ) . as delay is an important qos merit ( delay - sensitive traffic such as the video increases sharply in wide - spectrum wireless networks , e.g. , lte networks ) , we focus on the average buffer delay minimization by scheduling the allocated renewable energy in each slot . 
 accordingly , a constrained stochastic optimization problem is formulated . 
 next , we analyze the constraints : in each slot , the allocated power , the transmitted data , and the pu s isr should not extend the corresponding battery power , the corresponding buffer data , and the isr threshold , respectively . based on activity of the constraints , we propose two algorithms . 
 when the renewable energy constraint is inactive ( the data constraint or the isr constraint is active ) in all slots , we propose the optimal greedy algorithm . 
 when the renewable energy constraint is active in all slots , we propose an optimal power re - allocation algorithm . 
 generally , the two algorithms give the upper bound and lower bound , respectively . 
 additionally , we explore the case that the pu s private information ( e.g. , the pu s channel gain ) is not accessible by the su . 
 consider a cr network , where a pu co - exits with an su . 
 slotted - time model is utilized in the paper , and each slot is with length @xmath0 . 
 the channel power gains for pu tx @xmath1 pu rx , pu tx @xmath1 su rx , su tx @xmath1 su rx , and su tx @xmath1 pu rx during the @xmath2-th slot are denoted as @xmath3 $ ] , @xmath4 $ ] , @xmath5 $ ] , and @xmath6 $ ] , respectively . 
 the pu transmits with a fixed power @xmath7 . 
 the su tx is connected with a renewable energy harvester . 
 the harvested renewable energy is stored in a battery before usage . 
 the data are generated randomly in the application layer of the su tx , and wait in an fifo data buffer . in each slot , some data in the buffer are transmitted to the su rx . 
 denote the transmitting power of su in the @xmath2-th slot as @xmath8 $ ] . to guarantee the pu s transmission , the interference - signal - ratio ( isr ) at the pu

 we have @xmath19=q[n]-r[n]+d_a[n]\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the objective is to minimize the average buffer delay over @xmath20 slots under the isr constraint by scheduling the renewable allocation in each slot @xmath21\right\}_{i=1}^{n}$ ] . 
 accordingly , we have the following problem .

 in this section , the constraints in the formulated problem are analyzed . and 
 two optimal algorithms ( referred to as the greedy algorithm and the pa algorithm ) for special scenarios are proposed thereafter . moreover , the two algorithms give the upper bound and lower bound respectively . 
 although the bounds are not the exact solution , they give an important insight into the performance gap .

 more data transmission corresponds to more renewable allocation . 
 that is to say , allocate renewable as much as possible in each slot ( referred to as greedy renewable allocation ) is optimal for minimizing instant data queue length in a slot . 
 formally , the greedy renewable allocation can be expressed as @xmath26=\mathcal{c}[n]\end{aligned}\ ] ] for @xmath27 then there is a natural question__is the greedy renewable allocation optimal over several slots in average sense?is the greedy renewable allocation optimal for the formulated problem ? _ _      with respect to the optimality of the greedy allocation , we have the following lemma .    generally , the greedy renewable allocation is not optimal .    when the renewable generation process , the data arrival process , and channel state variation are markov processes , the formulated problem ( [ optimization problem when private available ] ) corresponds to @xmath28 of lemma 10 in @xcite . thus , the greedy renewable allocation is not optimal in this case . 
 thereafter , we arrive at the lemma .    _ 
 remark : although not optimal , the greedy renewable allocation is practically useful since its on - line feature and low - complexity . 
 in addition , as the greedy allocation is a feasible solution of ( [ optimization problem when private available ] ) , it gives an upper bound of the optimal data queue length . 
 _    the greedy renewable allocation is optimal in special circumstances . 
 the following lemma characterizes the scenarios that greedy allocation is optimal .

 when ( [ sufficient condition for optimality of greedy ] ) holds , the constraint ( [ merged constraint ] ) can be reduced as @xmath31\le \min\big\{\frac{\rho p_0 g_{11}[n]}{g_{21}[n]},\big(e^{q[n]}-1\big)\frac{p_0g_{12}[n]+n_0}{g_{22}[n]}\big\}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] define @xmath32:=\log \big[\frac{\rho p_0 g_{11}[n]}{g_{21}[n]}\frac{g_{22}[n]}{p_0g_{12}[n]+n_0}+1\big].\ ] ] ( [ 1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath15\le \min\big\{q[n],r_s[n]\big\}$ ] .

 hence we reach the lemma .

 it is a strong condition since ( [ sufficient condition for optimality of greedy ] ) should be satisfied for arbitrary @xmath36 $ ] . _    _ remark : @xmath37}{\tau}\ge \big(e^{q[n]}-1\big)\frac{p_0g_{12}[n]+n_0}{g_{22}[n]}$ ] means that the renewable energy is enough for emptying the data buffer in each slot . @xmath37}{\tau}\ge 
 \frac{\rho p_0 g_{11}[n]}{g_{21}[n]}$ ] demonstrates that the available renewable energy is more than the isr upper bound on the su s transmitting power in each slot . 
 alternatively , ( [ sufficient condition for optimality of greedy ] ) means that the renewable energy constraint is inactive in all slots . in either case , the greedy policy that transmits as much data as possible in each slot is optimal in average sense over slots . _      since @xmath17=q[1]+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n-1}\big(d_a[j]-r[j]\big)$ ] , we have @xmath38=nq[1]+\sum\limits_{n = 1}^{n+1}\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{n-1}d_a[j]-\sum\limits_{n = 1}^{n+1}\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{n-1}r[j].\ ] ] then ( [ optimization problem when private available ] ) is equivalent to the following problem . @xmath39\right\}_{n=1}^{n } } \sum\limits_{n = 1}^{n } \beta_n\log \big[\alpha_np[n]+1\big]\end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath40\le \mathcal{c}[n],\forall n\ ] ] where @xmath41}{p_0g_{12}[n]+n_0}$ ] , @xmath42 .    if @xmath43}{\tau}\le \min\bigg\{\frac{\rho p_0 g_{11}[n]}{g_{21}[n]},\big(e^{q[n]}-1\big)\frac{p_0g_{12}[n]+n_0}{g_{22}[n]}\bigg\}\end{aligned}\ ] ] for @xmath30 , @xmath44=e[n]$ ] . then ( [ equivalent optimization problem when private available ] ) becomes @xmath45\right\}_{n=1}^{n } } \sum\limits_{n = 1}^{n } \beta_n\log \big[\alpha_np[n]+1\big]\end{aligned}\ ] ]

 [ example1 ] demonstrates the power allocation of the pa algorithm for @xmath78 $ ] ( numerical example 1 ) , @xmath79 , @xmath80 $ ] , @xmath81 $ ] . for slot 1 , 
 the renewable at slot 1 is the initial renewable energy @xmath82=1 $ ] , all renewable energy is allocated , @xmath83=1 $ ] . for slot 1 & slot 2 , 
 the maximal renewable energy at slot 2 is @xmath82+ea[1]=1 + 1=2 $ ] . 
 as the channel condition for slot 2 ( @xmath84 $ ] ) is better enough than slot 1 ( @xmath85 $ ] ) , then the power allocation is adjusted and the re - allocation occurs . 
 more power is allocated at slot 2 , @xmath83=0.4 $ ] , @xmath86=1.6 $ ] . for slot 1 & slot 2 & slot 3 , 
 the maximal available renewable energy is @xmath82+ea[1]+ea[2]=1 + 1 + 2=4 $ ] . 
 since the channel condition for slot 3 ( @xmath87 $ ] ) is better enough than slot 1 and slot 2 , the power is re - allocated once again , more power is utilized for data transmission at slot 3 , @xmath83=0.5000 $ ] , @xmath86=1.3333 $ ] , @xmath88=2.1667]$ ] . 
 [ example2 ] shows the power allocation of the pa algorithm for @xmath89 $ ] ( numerical example 2 ) , @xmath79 , @xmath90 $ ] , @xmath91 $ ] . 
 the explanations for slot 1 and slot 1 & slot 2 are same as former example . for slot 1 & slot 2 & slot 3 , as the channel condition for slot 3 ( @xmath87 $ ] ) is not better enough than slot 1 and slot 2 , then no re - allocation occurs . 
 power allocation of slot 1 and slot 2 remains static as that for slot 1 & slot 2 , and the newly arrived power at slot 3 ( @xmath92=2 $ ] ) is totally allocated for slot 3 . 
 the su s renewable allocation constraint is related to @xmath7 , @xmath93 , etc . 
 hence there are two scenarios :    * the private information of the pu , e.g. , @xmath7 , @xmath93 , can be obtained by the su . * 
 the private information of the pu is unavailable at the su . 
 we have studied the scenario that the pu s private information is available at the su in section [ section private information available ] . in this section , 
 we investigate the problem _ how can we do when the private information is unavailable ? _    when the private information of the pu ( e.g. , @xmath7 , @xmath93 ) is unavailable , the su can not compute the second item @xmath94}{g_{21}[n]}$ ] in ( [ merged constraint ] ) . 
 in contrast , @xmath95+n_0 $ ] can be obtained at the su rx and can be fed back to the su tx . 
 the third one @xmath96}-1\big)\frac{p_0g_{12}[n]+n_0}{g_{22}[n]}$ ] can be obtained . 
 consider the following relaxed problem    @xmath97\right\}_{n=1}^{n } } \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{n = 1}^{n+1 } q[n]\end{aligned}\ ] ]    @xmath98&\le & \min\bigg\{\frac{e[n]}{\tau},\big(e^{q[n]}-1\big)\frac{p_0g_{12}[n]+n_0}{g_{22}[n]}\bigg\ } \nonumber\\ & : = & \mathcal{f}[n].\end{aligned}\ ] ]    since @xmath99\ge \mathcal{c}[n]$ ] for arbitrary @xmath2 , ( [ relaxed optimization problem when private unavailable ] ) is a relaxed version of ( [ optimization problem ] ) . 
 that is to say , the optimal data queue length of ( [ relaxed optimization problem when private unavailable ] ) gives a lower bound for that of ( [ optimization problem ] ) . 
 that is to say , even without the pu s private information , the su can derive a lower bound on the average buffer length by solving a relaxed problem . 
 furthermore , regarding the relaxed problem ( [ relaxed optimization problem when private unavailable ] ) , we have the following results .    for problem ( [ relaxed optimization problem when private unavailable ] ) , when @xmath100}{\tau}\ge \big(e^{q[n]}-1\big)\frac{p_0g_{12}[n]+n_0}{g_{22}[n]}\ ] ] for @xmath101 , the greedy allocation is optimal ; if @xmath100}{\tau } < \big(e^{q[n]}-1\big)\frac{p_0g_{12}[n]+n_0}{g_{22}[n]}\ ] ] for @xmath101 , the pa algorithm gives the optimal allocation . 
 the lemma can be verified by derives in section [ section private information available ] . 
 the detailed proofs are omitted for brevity . 
 in this section , simulations are carried out to illustrate the average data buffer length performance of the pa algorithm and the greedy algorithm . 
 unless otherwise specified , @xmath75 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 $ ] . 
 [ fig_sim1 ] plots the average buffer length performance v.s . 
 the channel condition @xmath87 $ ] for the greedy algorithm and the pa algorithm , respectively . we have set 
 @xmath105 $ ] , the initial renewable energy @xmath82=e_a[0]=12 $ ] , @xmath106 $ ] , the initial data @xmath107=1 $ ] , @xmath108 $ ] . 
 it can be observed that the average buffer length decreases with the channel condition improvement ( increase of @xmath87 $ ] ) for the pa algorithm . 
 in contrast , for the greedy algorithm , the buffer length decreases sharply in small value region of @xmath87 $ ] and remains almost constant when @xmath87>0.5 $ ] . 
 in addition , for bad channel conditions ( small value region of @xmath87 $ ] ) the gap between the pa algorithm and the greedy is apparently smaller than that for the good channel conditions ( the lager value region ) . 
 generally , the channel state improvement results in more data transmission given renewable energy arrival . for the pa algorithm , larger value of @xmath87 $ ] incurs the re - allocation of the renewables at slot 3 . specifically , when @xmath109 , the pa algorithm produces @xmath110 $ ] , i.e. , the renewable re - allocation happens at slot 2 only . 
 when @xmath87\ge 0.3 $ ] , the re - allocation happens at both slot 2 and slot 3 . 
 furthermore , with the increase of @xmath111 , more power is allocated to slot 3 ( e.g. , the power allocations are @xmath112 $ ] and @xmath113 $ ] for @xmath87=0.3 $ ] and @xmath87=0.9 $ ] , respectively ) . since the channel condition of slot 3 is the best among the there slots , more data can be transmitted . 
 thus , the average buffer length decreases with the increase of @xmath87 $ ] . for the greedy algorithm , when @xmath87 $ ] is small , the isr constraint ( [ isr constraint inproblem ] ) and the renewable constraint ( [ renewable constraint ] ) are active constraints for all the three slots ( especially for slot 3 ) . 
 consequently , the average buffer length decreases with the increase of @xmath87 $ ] . 
 once @xmath87 $ ] is larger enough , the active constraint becomes the rate constraint ( [ rate constraint ] ) . 
 that is to say , the transmitted data is determined by the buffer queue length at the beginning of the 3-th slot and it is irrelevant to @xmath87 $ ] . then the average buffer length remains static ( in the greedy algorithm , @xmath87 $ ] does not affect the data transmissions of slot 1 and slot 2 ) . 
 when @xmath87>0.5 $ ] , the average buffer length for the pa algorithm decreases and remains static for the greedy algorithm . 
 hence the gap between the two algorithms becomes apparently larger . 
 [ fig_sim2 ] draws the average buffer length performance regarding the mean renewable energy arrival , @xmath114 , for the pa algorithm and greedy algorithm , respectively . in the simulation , 
 @xmath115 $ ] , the initial renewable energy @xmath82=e_a[0]=1/4*\bar{e}_a$ ] , @xmath116 $ ] , the initial data @xmath107=2 $ ] , and @xmath117 $ ] . from the figure , we can find that with the increase of @xmath114 , the mean buffer length decreases for both algorithms , and the performance gap becomes indistinct ( almost zero finally ) . for the pa algorithm 
 , since the channel conditions of slot 1 and slot 2 are similar , no power reallocation happens between slot 1 and slot 2 . 
 the power re - allocation occurs between slot 2 and slot 3 , and the re - allocation becomes weaker with the increase of @xmath114 . 
 for example , the power allocation is @xmath118 $ ] for @xmath119 , i.e. , the stored renewable energy for slot 2 is totally re - allocated to slot 3 , @xmath86=0 $ ] & @xmath88=e[3]=e_a[1]+e_a[2]$ ] . in contrast , for @xmath120 , the power allocation is @xmath121 $ ] . 
 @xmath86=87.5\%*e_a[1]$ ] & @xmath88=12.5\%*e_a[1]+e_a[2]$ ] and only @xmath122 is re - allocated . 
 regarding the greedy algorithm , renewable energy constraint ( i.e. , ( [ renewable constraint ] ) ) is the active constraint . 
 then , the stored renewable energy is totally utilized in each slot , @xmath8=e[n]=e_a[n-1]$ ] . 
 when @xmath114 increases , for both algorithms , the allocated power in each slot increases , more data is transmitted . then the average buffer length decreases . 
 meanwhile , with the increase , the pa allocation approaches the greedy allocation . 
 thus , the average buffer length gap becomes minor . 
 [ fig_sim3 ] illustrates the average buffer length performance of the pa algorithm and the greedy algorithm regarding the mean data arrival , @xmath123 . in the simulation , 
 @xmath124 $ ] , @xmath82=e_a[0]=8 $ ] , @xmath125 $ ] , @xmath107=0 $ ] , and @xmath126 $ ] . 
 it can be seen that the average buffer length increase with the increase of @xmath123 according to linear relationship for the pa algorithm . concerning the greedy algorithm , 
 the increase is slow first and fast then . 
 the average buffer length gap between the two algorithms becomes smaller in small value region of @xmath123 and remains constant in large value region . 
 it can be explained as follows : the pa algorithm is irrelevant to the mean data arrival , and forasmuch , the produced power allocation remains as @xmath127 $ ] , and the transmitted data @xmath128+r[2]+r[3]$ ] is constant with respected to @xmath123 . 
 the average buffer length @xmath129 . 
 hence the average buffer length varies linearly with @xmath123 . with regard to the greedy algorithm , 
 since the initial data is zero , the rate constraint is active and the power allocation in slot 1 is zero . 
 when @xmath123 is small ( @xmath130 ) , for slot 2 and slot 3 , the rate constraint is active . 
 hence the increment is slow . when @xmath131 , @xmath132 , renewable energy constraint is active for slot 2 and rate constraint is active for slot 3 . 
 the increase is moderate . when @xmath133 , the renewable constraint is active for slot 2 and slot 3 . 
 then the increase becomes linear . 
 combing above analysis of the two algorithms , we can explain why the gap becomes smaller first and remains static then . 
 delay - optimal data transmission of cr networks in the presence of renewable energy is studied in the paper . considering the data generation , renewable energy arrival , and wireless channel state , the su s renewable energy allocation in each slot 
 is scheduled to minimize the average data buffer length with isr constraint . by formulating a constrained stochastic optimization problem and corresponding theoretical analysis 
 , we propose two practical algorithms : the on - line greedy algorithm and the off - line pa algorithm . 
 the two algorithms are respectively optimal in certain special conditions . 
 meanwhile , the greedy algorithm gives an upper bound on the average data buffer length , and the pa algorithm derives a lower bound . 
 additionally , the case that su can not get the pu s private information is also discussed . 
 numerical results demonstrate that the greedy algorithm and the pa algorithm can produce effective upper & lower bounds on the average buffer length and give important insights into the performance thereafter .

84,"the origin of cosmic rays is an unsolved problem since the discovery in 1912 . 
 the spectrum of cosmic rays has a break at the knee energy ( @xmath4  ev ) , and those below the knee energy are believed to have galactic origin . 
 recently , the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) found more than 50 sources on the galactic plane in the very high energy ( vhe ; @xmath5  gev ) gamma - ray band ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . because vhe gamma - rays are produced either through inverse compton scattering of low energy photons by relativistic electrons , or through the decay of pions produced by collisions of relativistic protons with interstellar medium , high energy particles are surely present in the vhe gamma - ray sources . 
 if relativistic electrons are present , they may be traced through the observations of synchrotron x - ray emission . 
 however , in spite of extensive x - ray followup observations , a non - negligible fraction of the galactic vhe gamma - ray sources do not have an x - ray counterpart , and they are referred to as unidentified ( unid ) sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    among identified galactic vhe gamma - ray sources , pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) represent the largest population @xcite . 
 accordingly , one would expect that pwne are the first candidate of the origin of the unid vhe gamma - ray sources . 
 however , identifying the vhe gamma - ray sources as pwne is not straightforward . 
 the vhe gamma - ray emission region sometimes shows significant spatial offset from the x - ray emission region or a pulsar ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 furthermore , the life time of x - ray emitting electrons through synchrotron emission may be shorter than that of vhe gamma - ray emitting electrons through compton scattering . 
 this means that x - ray emission from the pwne can be much dimmer than the vhe gamma - rays if the pwne are old . 
 finally , a pulsar is not always found in the vicinity of ( candidate ) pwne . 
 hess  j1427608 is one of the unid vhe gamma - ray sources located at @xmath6 @xcite , and is extended with @xmath7 . 
 the flux is @xmath8 in the 110  tev band with a photon index of @xmath9 @xcite . 
 no plausible counterpart is listed in the galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) catalog @xcite or in the simbad data base in the vicinity of hess  j1427608 . 
 we also looked for a possible counterpart in the atnf pulsar catalog @xcite . 
 however , no energetic pulsar was found within from hess  j1427608 . here 
 , the definition of the energetic pulsar is those with @xmath10  erg  s@xmath11  kpc@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the spin - down energy and @xmath14 is the distance to the source . 
 this search radius of is large enough compared to offsets of radio pulsars to vhe sources among known pwn systems , and virtually excludes the possibility of associating hess j1427608 with any known energetic radio pulsar . 
 thus , hess  j1427608 seems to be one of the most `` unlikely '' pwne among the vhe gamma - ray sources . in order to search for an x - ray counterpart 
 , we observed hess  j1427608 with suzaku , and also analyzed the xmm - newton archive data . 
 we observed the sky region including hess  j1427608 with suzaku ( @xcite ) from 2010 january 13 through 16 . 
 the journal of the observation is listed in table  [ tab : obslog ] . 
 suzaku is equipped with two types of detectors : four sets of x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis0xis3 : @xcite ) and a non - imaging hard x - ray detector ( hxd : @xcite ; @xcite ) . 
 xis1 uses the back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd while the others the front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds . among the four sensors , 
 xis2 is not operational and a part of xis0 ( corresponding to the off - source region in the latter analysis ) is not usable due to its anomaly . hereafter , 
 unless otherwise mentioned , we used only xis1 and xis3 data for the current analysis . 
 xis was operated in normal clocking mode without any window options . 
 spaced - row charge injection ( @xcite ; @xcite ) was used to reduce the effects of radiation damage . 
 we used version 2.4.12.27 of the processed data for hess  j1427608 . 
 the data was analyzed with the headas software version 6.10 and xspec version 12.6.0 . 
 we used the cleaned event file created by the suzaku team . 
 the resultant effective exposure was 104  ks . 
 figure 1 shows xis images in the soft ( 0.52  kev ) and the hard ( 28  kev ) bands . 
 the images were corrected for exposure using an exposure map generated by the ftool xisexpmapgen after subtracting non x - ray background ( nxb ) images generated by the ftool xisnxbgen @xcite . 
 finally , the xis1 and xis3 images were added , and the resulting image was binned to a pixel size of and smoothed with a gaussian of @xmath15 . 
 the position center and the extent of hess  j1427608 are shown as a black cross and a yellow dashed circle , respectively . 
 a few faint , point - like sources are seen in the soft band , while an apparently extended source is detected in the hard band . 
 the position and apparent extension of the hard source match those of hess  j1427608 . as will be shown in a later section , all the suzaku soft - band sources 
 may be explained by the point - like sources in the xmm - newton archive data while the suzaku hard - band source seems to be a truly new source . 
 we thus designate the central hard - band source suzaku  j14276051 , and mainly focus on this source in the following analysis . 
 because hess  j1427608 and suzaku  j14276051 are both extended , we evaluate the x - ray size of the source . 
 for this purpose , careful estimation of the x - ray background is necessary since suzaku  j14276051 is relatively faint . in particular 
 , this region contains significant contribution from the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) as well as the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , both of which are subject to mirror vignetting effect resulting in a centrally - peaked spatial distribution . 
 therefore , it is not appropriate to assume a flat background image defined at an off - source region within the field of view ( fov ) . instead , we estimated the grxe+cxb image in the source region through monte - carlo simulation . 
 we explain details of the x - ray background estimation below . 
 first , we estimated the surface brightness of the grxe and cxb assuming their uniform distribution in the sky . for this purpose 
 , we analyzed the x - ray spectrum in the off - source annulus region shown in figure  [ fig : xisspecreg ] . 
 the region ( between and from the center of suzaku  j14276051 ) was selected to minimize contamination from suzaku  j14276051 . in other words , 
 the off - source region contains only the grxe and the cxb after the subtraction of nxb . 
 figure  [ fig : xisanuspec ] shows the spectra extracted from the off - source region . 
 the spectra were modeled by optically thin thermal three temperature plasma with neutral iron emission line plus the cxb following @xcite . 
 in the course of model fitting , the hydrogen column density was fixed to @xmath16 determined by hi observations ( @xcite ) , the photon index of the cxb to 1.4 , and the surface brightness of the cxb to @xmath17 in the 210  kev band ( @xcite ) . 
 we made the ancillary response file using the ftool xissimarfgen assuming a uniform emission in the sky . 
 the model could reproduce the observed spectrum well . 
 the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : xisanuspec ] . 
 next , we simulated the grxe+cxb event data assuming uniform emission with the best - fit spectrum model determined above using the ftool xissim @xcite . in order to avoid an extra ambiguity due to poor statistics , the exposure time for the simulation 
 was set to 500 ks . 
 then we extracted the grxe+cxb spectrum in the source region and added it to the nxb in the source region to obtain the total background spectrum , following the instruction in section 5.5.2 of the suzaku technical description . 
 figure  [ fig : xisspeccomp ] shows the simulated background spectra of the xis1 and xis3 respectively as well as the source and off - source spectra . as can be seen from the spectra , the source region contains significant emission above the grxe+cxb level . 
 figure  [ fig : xisprof ] shows the radial profiles of the nxb - subtracted image and the simulated grxe+cxb image in the 28  kev band . 
 the difference is attributed to suzaku  j14276051 . even if we consider the relatively broad half - power radius (; 
 @xcite ) of the point spread function of suzaku mirror , suzaku  j14276051 is clearly extended . in order to estimate the source extent , we compared the observed radial profile with that of a model calculation for an extended source having a 2d - gaussian distribution . instead of performing the @xmath18 fitting , we calculated @xmath18 for a set of @xmath19 , i.e. , , , , and . 
 the simulated profiles were generated with xissim . 
 it turned out that none of them gave an acceptable fit ; the radial profile of suzaku  j14276051 has a core and a tail in comparison with the best - fit simulation data . 
 we thus performed the @xmath18 test using only the core region ( @xmath20 ) . 
 we then could obtain an acceptable fit ( @xmath21 for 3 degrees of freedom ) . 
 the best - fit value obtained was @xmath0 with 90% confidence level . 
 although suzaku  j14276051 is extended , we tried to search for pulsations in the xis light curve as point sources may be hidden in the image . 
 we extracted light curves of the source region in the 0.510  kev band and binned them to a time resolution of 16 sec . 
 we calculated fourier power spectra every 2048  bin ( @xmath22  9.1  hour ) using the ftool powspec to obtain the ensemble - averaged power spectrum density ( psd ) . 
 the psd of xis1 is dominated by the orbital period of the satellite and its higher harmonics , probably due to the contamination of earth albedo . 
 thus we used only the psd of xis3 in the subsequent analysis . 
 no significant peak was detected in the psd with an upper limit of @xmath23 ( poisson fluctuation level was normalized to 2.0 ) , which corresponds to an rms amplitude of 0.0064  count  s@xmath11 . 
 because the net count rate of the source is 0.021  count  s@xmath11 , this corresponds to a relative amplitude of 31% . 
 thus we conclude that no coherent pulsation is present in the light curves of suzaku j14276051 with an upper limit of 31 % between the pulse periods of 32  sec and 32768  sec . 
 figure  [ fig : xisspec ] shows the background - subtracted energy spectra of suzaku  j14276051 . here 
 , the background spectrum ( sum of grxe , cxb , and nxb ) was calculated with the method detailed in section  [ subsec : xisimage ] . 
 it is found that the spectrum of suzaku  j14276051 is featureless and heavily absorbed . 
 although a hint of feature is seen in the 67  kev band , which may be due to the spacial variation of the iron emission line in grxe , it is not statistically significant . 
 we calculated the ancillary response file using the ftool xissimarfgen for an extended source of a gaussian profile with @xmath24 . 
 the spectrum was well modeled by either an absorbed power - law or a thermal model , whose best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : xisparm ] . however , 
 a thermal origin is unlikely because the abundance is unreasonably small , and the x - rays are thus considered to be produced by non - thermal processes . 
 the absorbed x - ray flux of the source is @xmath25 in the 210  kev band . 
 we also analyzed the spectrum of the hxd to search for emission of suzaku  j14276051 above 10  kev . 
 we used the background spectrum called `` bgd_d '' provided by the suzaku team @xcite and added the cxb to it using the ftool hxdpinnxbpi . 
 we used the xis nominal - position response file categorized to epoch 6 , released as a caldb . 
 we made the background - subtracted spectrum and fitted it with a power - law , whose photon index was fixed to @xmath26 , as derived from the xis analysis . 
 the flux in the 1540  kev band is ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) if no systematic error is taken into account . 
 based on @xcite , who showed the reproducibility of nxb in the 1540  kev band is about 3% in the 90% confidence range , we constructed the nxb spectra with 3% higher count rates to include the systematic error of the nxb reproduction . 
 then , a significant signal is no longer detected . 
 we thus obtained the 90% upper limit of @xmath30 in the 1540  kev band . 
 in order to estimate the contribution of point sources , we analyzed the archival data of xmm - newton including the hess  j1427608 field . 
 xmm - newton ( @xcite ) carries three x - ray telescopes each equipped with a european photon imaging camera ( epic ) at the foci . 
 epic consists of two mos ccd camera ( mos1 and mos2 : @xcite ) and a pn ccd camera ( pn : @xcite ) . 
 the observation was carried out on 2007 august 9 for 24  ks . during the observation , epic was operated in full - frame mode with medium filter . 
 the data were analyzed with the science analysis software ( sas ) version 10.0.0 , headas version 6.10 and xspec version 12.6.0 . 
 time intervals of enhanced background , which are caused by soft proton flares , were removed with thresholds of 0.20  count  s@xmath11 for mos1 , 0.24  count  s@xmath11 for mos2 , and 0.6  count  s@xmath11 for pn , respectively , calculated for pattern=0 events above 10  kev . 
 we used x - ray events of pattern=012 ( for mos cameras ) and pattern=04 ( for pn camera ) for the image and spectral analyses . 
 the resultant effective exposures were 21  ks ( mos1 ) , 22  ks ( mos2 ) , and 15  ks ( pn ) , respectively . 
 the journal of the observation is listed in table  [ tab : obslog ] . 
 figure  [ fig : epicimage ] shows the summed images of mos1 and mos2 in the soft ( 0.32  kev ) and the hard ( 212  kev ) bands . 
 the xis images are also overlaid in green contours . using the sas tool edetect_chain , 
 a total of 16 point sources were detected within from the center of suzaku  j14276051 . 
 eleven and seven sources were found in the soft and the hard bands , respectively , and two sources were commonly detected in both bands . 
 names and count rates of the point sources are listed in table  [ tab : xmmps ] . 
 summing up the count rates of the point sources located within the suzaku source region ( x1 through x7 ) , we obtained @xmath31  count  s@xmath11 in the 0.52  kev band . 
 this may be converted to the xis bi count rate of @xmath32  count  s@xmath11 assuming the power - law spectrum in table 2 . because this is comparable to the rate actually observed with suzaku ( @xmath33  count  s@xmath11 ) , 
 the xis data may be explained by the sum of the xmm - newton point sources in the soft band . 
 on the other hand , if we carry out a similar calculation for the hard band , the xmm - newton point sources would produce @xmath34   count  s@xmath11 in xis . 
 because this corresponds to only @xmath35  % of the actual xis count rate , suzaku  j14276051 is difficult to be explained by the sum of the sources and may be a truly diffuse source . 
 we calculated the energy spectra of only x1 and of the summed spectra of the central seven point sources ( x1 through x7 ) . 
 we made the response file and the ancillary response file using the sas tool rmfgen and arfgen , respectively . 
 we fitted these spectra with the model of an absorbed power - law . 
 because of the poor statistics , the photon index was fixed to 3.1 , which was determined by the spectral analysis of suzaku  j14276051 . 
 the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : epicparm ] . 
 figure  [ fig : epicspec ] shows the summed spectra of the seven point sources . 
 the absorbed x - ray flux of the summed spectra was @xmath36 in the 210  kev band , which is about 5% of the flux derived with suzaku for suzaku  j14276051 . 
 it is also found that the column density of the summed spectra is two orders of magnitude smaller than that derived for suzaku  j14276051 . 
 these results confirm that suzaku  j14276051 can not be explained by the xmm - newton point sources . 
 we discovered an apparently - diffuse hard x - ray source , suzaku  j14276051 with suzaku , and several point sources with xmm - newton in spatial coincidence with hess  j1427608 . 
 we found that suzaku  j14276051 could not be explained by the sum of the point sources detected with xmm - newton , and concluded that it is a truly diffuse source . even if time variability of the detected point - like sources is considered , it is unlikely that suzaku  j14276051 is explained by them because the hydrogen column densities are quite different . 
 the xmm - newton point sources are most likely foreground sources . to explain 
 suzaku  j14276051 by the sum of several point sources would require that all those sources would be below detection threshold at the time of the xmm - newton observation , which appears very unlikely . 
 thus , we concluded that suzaku  j14276051 is an intrinsically diffuse source and the x - ray counterpart of hess  j1427608 . 
 we searched various catalogs and literature for the possible counterpart of hess  j1427608 in other wavebands . 
 a gev gamma - ray source , 2fgl  j1427.66048c , is listed in the 2-year catalog of fermi ( @xcite ) . 
 the gev source is located at @xmath37 , which is away from the center of hess  j1427608 ( see figure  [ fig : xisimage ] ) . since the error radius of the position is about , 
 it may be associated with hess  j1427608 @xcite . however , 
 this is a `` c - designator - applied '' 
 fermi source whose position , emission characteristics , or even existence may not be reliable due to a potential confusion with interstellar emission @xcite . 
 we believe it is premature to discuss a possible association of the gev source to hess  j1427608 ; future fermi data and analysis is necessary . 
 we also searched the akari point source catalogues ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . 
 no point source was found in the mid - infrared ( @xmath38 m ) and the far - infrared ( @xmath39 m ) bands within from the center of hess  j1427608 . 
 although we mentioned hess  j1427608 as one of the most `` unlikely '' pwne in the introduction , its center - filled morphology and featureless spectrum in the x - ray band suggest that the source could be a pwn . 
 thus we postulate here that the source is a pwn as a working hypothesis 
 . figure  [ fig : wideband ] shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from x - rays to vhe gamma - rays . 
 the estimated synchrotron spectra from the vhe gamma - ray spectrum @xcite , assuming that the same electron population would inverse - compton scatter cmb photons up to vhe gamma - rays and radiate synchrotron emission in x - rays , are also plotted with a local magnetic field @xmath40 of 1 , 3 , and 10@xmath41 . 
 this sed plot indicates that the simple one - zone leptonic model with @xmath40 of about 5@xmath42 g would roughly explain both the x - ray and vhe gamma - ray data . in this context 
 , the steep suzaku spectrum of @xmath43 could indicate that the suzaku energy band is higher than the cut - off energy . 
 the inferred magnetic field strength of @xmath225@xmath42 g is within the range of typical values on the galactic plane . 
 thus the sed is consistent with a one - zone leptonic model expected for pwne . 
 we next examine the flux ratio and luminosities . the x - ray to vhe gamma - ray ratio is useful to probe the nature of unid sources @xcite . in the case of hess 
 j1427608 , the unabsorbed x - ray flux @xmath44 of @xmath45 ( 210  kev ) and the vhe gamma - ray flux @xmath46 of @xmath47 ( 110 tev ) result in a flux ratio of @xmath48 . 
 if we assume a distance to hess  j1427608 of @xmath49  kpc , the x - ray luminosity would be @xmath50 . 
 the estimated flux ratio and x - ray luminosity are within the values of known x - ray and vhe gamma - ray emitting pwne , given that both values show a large scatter : @xmath51 in @xmath52 and @xmath53  erg  s@xmath11 in @xmath54 @xcite . 
 thus the flux ratio and luminosity are also consistent with sources of pwn origin .    while there are observational evidences supporting the pwn origin as discussed above , others challenge such a view . with the assumption of @xmath49  kpc , 
 the core size and whole radial extent would be 2  pc and 12  pc , respectively . 
 the core size of 2  pc is a little large , but not exceptional among other pwn @xcite . 
 the whole extent of 12  pc is not surprisingly large compared with the nebula of e.g. , psr  j18261334 @xcite . 
 the largest drawback of the pwn hypothesis is lacking the detection of both a pulsar and radio pwn associated . 
 it is known that the pulsar luminosity and its nebula luminosity in the x - ray band are correlated over 7 orders of magnitude @xcite . according to the correlation 
 , the not - yet - detected pulsar should be brighter than @xmath55 in x - rays , one - tenth of the pwn luminosity . such a pulsar would have been easily detected with xmm - newton . 
 in addition , the x - ray photon index of the nebula ( @xmath56 ) is very steep among the known x - ray nebulae most of which have a @xmath57 between 1.22.2 @xcite .    in terms of photon 
 index comparison , non - thermal snrs might present a more plausible scenario than pwne . 
 most of non - thermal snrs radiate synchrotron x - rays with a photon index of @xmath58 @xcite . 
 the x - ray luminosity and extent are also compatible to synchrotron snrs @xcite . 
 however , the facts that the source has a center - filled morphology in the x - ray band and no detection of the shell structure in the radio band hamper the interpretation as a non - thermal snr .    in summary , we have not reached a firm conclusion on the nature of hess  j1427608 . 
 pwn and/or non - thermal snr , which are not necessary exclusive to each other , are the prime candidates but a decisive observational evidence is lacking . increasing statistics in fermi data 
 may reveal a pulsation from 2fgl  j1427.66048c 
 . a deep radio observation would also be helpful if it could detect pulsations or reveal the morphology of the source . 
 we observed hess  j1427608 with suzaku , which is combined with the archival data analysis of xmm - newton , and obtained following results .    * 
 we discovered an x - ray counterpart , suzaku  j14276051 , of hess  j1427608 . 
 it is intrinsically extended ( @xmath59 ) and has a spectral shape of an absorbed power - law with a photon index of @xmath2 . 
 * several faint point sources were found in spatial coincidence with hess  j1427608 using xmm - newton archival data in the soft x - ray band . * 
 observational properties of suzaku  j14276051 and hess  j1427608 are compared with those of known pwne and non - thermal snrs . 
 some properties favor the pwn and/or snr origin , but the available data are insufficient to draw firm conclusions .

85,"a wealth of information about the motion of microscopic particles can be gathered by scattering a well - controlled probe , typically light in the case of atoms with optical resonances . 
 young s historic double slit experiment demonstrated that the probe light wave shows interference if it can propagate along more than a single path . 
 interference fringes therefore can give sensitive information about the scatterers , as was shown by eichmann and coworkers @xcite by realizing young s double slits with two trapped atoms . 
 on the other hand , the motional state of the probed particle gives information about the probe field , as recently discussed by eschner @xcite . as a commonly accepted rule 
 , one can have either full interference contrast or full which - way - information at the same time . between these two extremes , 
 there are interesting intermediate situations that can be quantified using general quantum duality relations derived by englert @xcite that have been used for instance in atom interferometers @xcite . in mesoscopic samples of weakly disordered clouds of cold atoms , 
 coherent multiple scattering of light leads to enhanced backscattering @xcite .    in this letter , 
 we investigate coherent backscattering ( cbs ) of light by two atoms that are trapped in harmonic oscillators . 
 this model system can describe how atomic motion destroys multiple scattering interference via recoil and doppler effects . 
 we calculate the cbs interference visibility both at zero and finite temperature in shallow traps that allow to treat the limiting case of freely moving atoms . 
 the cbs double scattering geometry realizes a two - way interferometer where the two mutually exclusive alternatives are the order in which the photon visits both atoms . 
 which - way information is then present if one knows which of both atoms has been visited first . 
 we calculate the which - way distinguishability proposed by englert and show how it is physically encoded . 
 consider two atoms trapped in identical harmonic oscillators at fixed positions well separated from each other by many wavelengths of the probe light . 
 a single incident photon with wave vector @xmath0 and polarization @xmath1 is then scattered by the atoms and detected in the backscattering direction @xmath2 with polarization analysis in the helicity - preserving channel @xmath3 . 
 a photon scattered in the backscattering direction by a single atom with a non - degenerate ground state has the same polarization , but opposite helicity , and does not contribute to the detected intensity . 
 since the atoms are far from each other , the probability for repeated scattering is very small . 
 the detector then receives a photon that has been scattered exactly once by each atom , either along way a or along way b , see fig .  [ twoways.fig ] . 
 the total amplitude is the coherent superposition of both amplitudes . 
 such an interference of counter - propagating multiple scattering amplitudes in the backscattering direction is known as coherent backscattering ( cbs ) @xcite .    without interaction , the free electromagnetic field and the internal and external ( motional ) atomic degrees of freedom

 , title=""fig:"",width=151 ]    [ atomicoverlap.fig ] 
 since the atoms are well separated , the total double scattering process is described by the product of two individual scattering processes with free propagation inbetween . in the far - field photon propagator @xmath26 
 , we expand the absolute distance to linear order in the small relative displacement : @xmath27 . in the exponential 
 , the zeroth - order contribution @xmath28 drops out from all interference quantities , whereas the linear term generates a phase difference between the amplitudes of @xmath29 and @xmath30 and must be kept . to this leading order 
 , the denominator can be taken constant .    the transition operator @xcite for way a takes a useful form in time representation and interaction picture where @xmath31 . 
 up to irrelevant prefactors , @xmath32 read from right to left , it describes how the photon is scattered first by atom 1 , then propagates with @xmath33 , and is finally scattered by atom 2 . 
 the transition operator @xmath34 of the reverse way b is obtained from @xmath35 by the substitution @xmath36 . 
 the complex detuning @xmath37 of the probe frequency @xmath38 from the transition frequency includes the spontaneous decay rate or inverse lifetime @xmath39 . 
 retardation times of order @xmath40 have been neglected in the time arguments of the operators . 
 indeed , the photon scattering by two atoms defines two distinct time scales for the atomic motion : first , the total inverse detuning @xmath41 which is simply @xmath42 at resonance . 
 second , the free propagation time @xmath40 from one atom to the other . for resonant atomic scatterers with @xmath43 of order @xmath44s or larger , and typical distances @xmath28 of 1@xmath45 mm or less , 
 one has @xmath46 such that the scattering is resonance - dominated , and the free propagation time can be safely neglected . in all of the following , 
 we have in mind the limit of quasi - free atoms and therefore consider the case of shallow traps @xmath47 in which the oscillation period of an atom is much larger than the time @xmath48 it takes to scatter a photon . 
 the incident photon can choose between two _ a priori _ indistinguishable paths , way @xmath49 or @xmath50 . 
 following englert s fashionable choice @xcite , we call this binary degree of freedom a qubit . 
 let @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the choice of way @xmath49 and @xmath50 . scattering entangles the qubit with the motional degrees of freedom . 
 consequently , the atomic oscillator states can serve as a which - path detector .    prior to scattering , 
 the total initial state of qubit and detector is @xmath53 . 
 the qubit is in the pure state @xmath54 , the symmetric superposition of equally probable ways . 
 an external cooling laser field serves as a thermal bath for the trapped atoms . 
 the detector is thus in a thermal state @xmath55 at inverse temperature @xmath56 with partition function @xmath57 . 
 the total final state is then obtained by applying the transition operators associated with way @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath58 in general , @xmath59 is not a unitary operator since it describes only the scattering amplitude around the backscattering direction . 
 the factor @xmath60 guarantees , however , that @xmath61 is properly normalized . 
 adapting englert s general definitions @xcite , we can express the _ visibility _ @xmath62 and the _ distinguishability _ @xmath63 obeying the fundamental _ duality relation _ @xmath64 as follows : @xmath65 the visibility is the ratio of interference contribution and background intensity @xmath66 and therefore equal to the cbs contrast . 
 the distinguishability @xmath63 describes the maximum which - way information available in principle , i.e. , that can be extracted by the additional measurement of an optimal detector observable ; @xmath67 denotes the trace - class norm of the operator @xmath68 . 
 another interesting quantity is the _ predictability _ @xmath69 the predictability measures the amount of which - way information available _ a priori _ , as for instance in unbalanced interferometers like young s double slits with different widths . for balanced interferometers @xmath70 , 
 the predictability vanishes , @xmath71 .    with the help of these quantities 
 , we can quantify the breakdown of coherent photon backscattering by mobile atoms , both at zero and finite temperature . 
 the distinguishability @xmath72 is difficult to evaluate in our case because it is defined via the trace - class norm of operators on the infinite - dimensional hilbert space of harmonic oscillators . on the contrary , visibility @xmath62 and predictability 
 @xmath73 involve a thermal harmonic average of products like @xmath74 or @xmath75 . 
 since the transition operator ( [ transitionoperatora ] ) contains only exponentials linear in the displacement , taking the trace amounts to gaussian integration . 
 at zero temperature , the atoms are initially in their respective harmonic oscillator ground states . in other words , 
 the detectors are prepared in pure states . setting @xmath76 in ( [ d_and_v ] ) permits to show that in this case the duality relation is always saturated : @xmath77 . 
 thus , we can use the visibility @xmath62 , much easier to calculate than the distinguishability @xmath63 , in order to understand how much which - way information is present and how it is encoded . carrying out the thermal average , we find in the limit @xmath78 @xmath79 neglecting higher - order terms @xmath80 in the two relevant small parameters defined as 
 follows : the influence of atomic recoil without harmonic trapping is encoded in the factor @xmath81 with @xmath82 the recoil energy , @xmath83 the probe detuning from the atomic resonance , and @xmath84 as before . 
 the harmonic trap enters through the parameter @xmath85 it is worthwile to discuss the physical significance of both parameters . 
 let us first consider a very shallow trap @xmath86 where the free recoil effect described by @xmath87 dominates . at least to order @xmath88 , we find @xmath89 . 
 together with the general property @xmath90 ( read : the _ a priori _ information can not be larger than the total available information ) this implies that all which - way information is actually available _ a priori _ : @xmath91 . just as in the case of other asymmetric interferometers , 
 this predictability is due to unbalanced scattering amplitudes . at perpendicular scattering @xmath92 , 
 the situation is completely symmetric , and both paths are equally probable . 
 but for the extreme case @xmath93 of atoms in line with the probe , the atom in front scatters either the incident probe photon at the laser frequency or the already scattered photon on its way out again , now at laser frequency minus twice the recoil . 
 a different frequency generally implies a different scattering cross section such that the two paths have different probabilities . for a given position configuration , 
 this information is known _ a priori _ without the necessity to perform any measurement . 
 more quantitatively , the relative change in the resonant cross section @xmath94^{-1}$ ] under a small frequency change @xmath95 then is @xmath96 , one finds exactly @xmath97 . to this order 
 , the predictability vanishes at exact detuning , since a small frequency change on the flat top of the resonance lorentzian has no effect . 
 let us now interpret the influence of harmonic trapping at zero temperature . 
 the predictability ( [ predzero ] ) contains no contribution in @xmath98 , which indicates that this parameter encodes which - path information that may only be revealed _ a posteriori _ by an appropriate measurement on the detector . in a temporal picture ( see fig . 
 [ atomicoverlap.fig](b ) ) , one can determine which way the photon has taken if one can measure which atom has scattered the photon first . 
 this is only possible if the initial position uncertainty @xmath25 is smaller than the distance @xmath99 travelled by the first scattering atom . 
 more quantitatively , the first scatterer takes up the recoil in the direction of @xmath100 and travels the distance @xmath101{2\hbar { { \omega_\ab{rec } } } / m}}\delta t $ ] during the whole time @xmath102 until the emission of the final photon by the second atom . 
 is simply twice the total contribution per atom that can be justified by a stationary - phase argument if both the wigner time delay of the phase and the amplitude change of the resonant scattering function @xmath103 are taken into account . 
 ] at that moment , the second atom receives the same recoil in the direction @xmath100 , such that the final momentum states for both ways become indistinguishable ( note that the recoil in the direction joining the atoms is exchanged instantaneously , because we can neglect the propagation time ) . 
 the zero - temperature position uncertainty is the oscillator length @xmath104 , which finally shows that which - path information is indeed present on the scale @xmath105 . 
 on the steep slope of a resonance curve implies a large scattering cross section difference @xmath106 that can provide which - path information . 
 ( b ) cbs visibility ( [ d_and_v ] ) as function of the thermal doppler shift ( [ xiclassical ] ) at resonance @xmath107 . 
 , title=""fig:"",width=207 ]   on the steep slope of a resonance curve implies a large scattering cross section difference @xmath106 that can provide which - path information . 
 ( b ) cbs visibility ( [ d_and_v ] ) as function of the thermal doppler shift ( [ xiclassical ] ) at resonance @xmath107 . 
 , title=""fig:"",width=283 ]    if the atoms are coupled to a thermal bath , the detector is not prepared in a pure state , and one expects that the duality relation no longer saturates . 
 we thus have to calculate visibility and distinguishability separately . 
 after the gaussian thermal average , the visibility is given in terms of a product of amplitudes like ( [ transitionoperatora ] ) for way a and b. it can be evaluated numerically for all values of the detuning @xmath108 and of the thermal trap parameter @xmath109 this parameter corresponds to the zero - temperature trap parameter ( [ zeta ] ) at effective oscillator excitation @xmath110 { { \omega_\ab{ho } } } $ ] , with @xmath111^{-1}$ ] the bose - einstein distribution function . for highly excited atoms 
 @xmath112 the oscillator frequency drops out of the definition of the thermal trap parameter which becomes @xmath113 the classical thermal doppler shift ( @xmath114 ) in units of the linewidth . 
 figure [ visibility.fig](b ) shows a plot of the visibility at exact resonance @xmath107 as function of @xmath115 on a semi - logarithmic scale . here 
 , we concentrate on the effect of harmonic trapping at finite temperature and neglect the free recoil contribution , which is justified if @xmath116 . the visibility decreases monotonically with temperature . for @xmath117 
 , we can expand to lowest order and find analytically ( compare with eq . 
 ( [ distzero ] ) ) : @xmath118 at this point , we recover the case of free thermal atoms . 
 our result ( [ visfinal ] ) agrees with the cbs contrast calculated in @xcite for the low - temperature case @xmath119 ( if the avarage medium effect included there is disregarded ) . 
 note that our calculation is also valid in the high - temperature regime @xmath120 where the visibility goes to zero as @xmath121 . 
 it is too difficult to evaluate analytically the trace - class norm for the distinguishability @xmath63 with the transition operators in the general form ( [ transitionoperatora ] ) . 
 therefore , we formally expand the exponentials in powers of the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath122 { { { \omega_\ab{rec } } } / { { \omega_\ab{ho } } } } } $ ] . the leading order expression for @xmath63 in the shallow - trap limit @xmath112 
 becomes @xmath123 here , @xmath124 $ ] is the momentum associated with @xmath125 , the antisymmetric oscillator mode projected onto the probe direction @xmath100 . 
 it is reasonable that only this mode should be relevant : symmetric motion can not encode differential information about the paths ( and could be disposed of by transformation into a co - moving frame ) , whereas the momentum along the only other available direction @xmath126 is exchanged instantaneously . to linear order in @xmath127 , 
 the positive operator @xmath128 can be moved outside the absolute value ( using @xmath129 since @xmath130 and @xmath131 commute to zeroth order in @xmath132 ) . 
 this makes the distinguishability proportional to the thermal expectation value of the momentum modulus , which is easy to evaluate for a maxwell - boltzmann distribution : @xmath133 it can be read as the relative shift @xmath134 of the resonant cross section under the small doppler frequency change @xmath135 . 
 this suggests an interpretation in terms of the frequency - shift mechanism ( cf . 
 fig.[visibility.fig](a ) ) : by measuring the actual atomic velocities _ a posteriori _ , one can determine which way was more probable : if atom 1 is found to move towards a red - detuned probe and atom 2 to move away from it , way a was more probable than b because atom 1 had a larger absorption cross section  this is simply the principle of doppler cooling . 
 contrary to the zero - temperature case , now the predictability @xmath136 is zero to the order considered because the interferometer symmetry is reestablished by the isotropic thermal average . naturally , as in the case of harmonic trapping at zero temperature , the distinguishability vanishes also at exact resonance @xmath107 because no differential information can be encoded on the flat top of the resonance lorentzian . in the high - temperature limit @xmath137 , 
 i.e. , for very large frequence shifts @xmath138 with moderate detuning , one explores the flat wings of the lorentzian , and the distinguishability must then drop to zero .    at finite temperature , 
 the quantum duality is no longer saturated and reads to order @xmath115 : @xmath139    \left(\frac { 2 k_\ab{in } { { v_\ab{rms } } } } { |\gamma| } \right)^2    .\ ] ] this value of @xmath63 assumes an optimal measurement within just the system of center - of - mass motion . 
 but the initial thermal distribution requires the presence of a thermal bath ( e.g. , cooling lasers ) . 
 the total system ( detector plus bath ) is described by a pure state for which the quantum duality saturates . 
 however , the which - path information could only be retrieved by an optimal measurement including all bath degrees of freedom that are not under our control . 
 measurements on just the detector necessarily correspond to a non - optimal measurement with respect to the whole system and therefore imply a reduced distinguishability . 
 we have studied the coherent backscattering effect from two trapped atoms , an interesting case study for quantitative quantum duality in a physically realistic setting . at zero temperature , 
 inelastic scattering due to the recoil effect provides _ a priori _ which - path information . 
 further which - path information can be gained by measuring which atom has scattered the photon first , which is possible if the initial position uncertainty is small enough . at finite temperature , the atomic movement destroys the interference once the average doppler shift becomes of the order of the resonance width . 
 which - path information resides in the atomic velocities via resonance conditions , but the duality inequality no longer saturates because an initial thermal state corresponds to a non - optimal detector preparation .

86,"tracking and vertexing in a high multiplicity environment such as the lhc is a challenging task . in order to get a good secondary vertex resolution 
 , one needs measurements as close to the interaction point as possible . 
 to have acceptably low occupancies one needs a very fine segmented detector . 
 the cms experiment uses a hybrid pixel detector with @xmath1m@xmath2 pixel size . 
 the barrel part has three layers at mean radii of 4.4 , 7.3 and 10.2 cm . in the innermost layer the occupancy reaches @xmath3 at the full lhc luminosity of @xmath4s@xmath5@xmath6 . 
 + the main purpose of the pixel detector is the reconstruction of secondary vertices ( mainly for b and @xmath7 physics ) and the generation of track seeds for the reconstruction in the full tracker . 
 also tracks reconstructed with the pixel detector alone is the only available tracking information at the first stage of the higher level trigger ( hlt ) . here 
 speed is more important than accuracy or efficiency . 
 as pointed out in @xcite , pixel - only tracks can be reconstructed in less than 20ms ( 110ms ) per event for regional ( global ) track finder . 
 the @xmath8 resolution is @xmath9[gev / c ] and the impact parameter can be measured with @xmath10 m for @xmath11gev / c rising to @xmath12 m for @xmath13 gev / c . 
 the component of the vertex position along the beam line is measured at the hlt . 
 the resolution depends on the physics channel ( number and momentum of tracks ) and is typically @xmath14 m with an efficiency of @xmath15 . 
 the smallest independent unit of the barrel support structure is a half - shell . 
 it is made out of 53 cm long and 0.25 mm thin carbon fiber ladders glued to aluminum cooling pipes with 0.3 mm wall thickness . to reach full spatial coverage ladders 
 are mounted with overlap on alternating sides of the cooling tubes . 
 this is shown in figure [ fig : mechanics ] on the left . 
 since the ladders are not tilted , charge sharing is enhanced between pixels due to lorentz drift in the 4 t magnetic field and hence the spatial resolution through analog signal interpolation is increased . 
 + eight modules are screwed onto each ladder using thermal grease to improve the heat transfer from the electronics components to the cooling tubes . 
 this allows an easy removal of the mounted modules . 
 + three half - shells are mounted together at the end flange building up half of the barrel detector . 
 the left and right half barrels are mechanically separated . 
 a six layer pcb is mounted on the end flange . 
 it distributes power and signals to the individual modules . 
 the pcb is equipped with lcds ( low current differential signal ) driver chips and is otherwise passive . 
 about 10 cm long cables and cooling tubes connect the barrel support structure to the service half - cylinders . 
 a sketch of the later is shown in figure [ fig : supply ] . 
 the barrel layers are made out of two types of sensor modules . 
 each layer has 32 half modules at the edges of the half - shells and 128 , 224 and 320 full modules for the three layers respectively . 
 a sketch of a module is shown in figure [ fig : module ] . 
 16 ( 8) readout chips ( rocs ) are bump bonded to the full ( half ) sensors . 
 a dedicated in bump bonding process has been developed at psi @xcite and the whole production is done in house . a three layer flexible high density interconnect ( hdi ) is glued on top of the sensor and wire bonded to the rocs and to the token bit manager chip ( tbm ) @xcite . 
 it is then glued to si - nitride base stripes which give mechanical stability and reduces stress to the bump bonds due to an excellent cte match to si . 
 details about the module assembly are described in these proceedings ( @xcite ) .      the active area of a full ( half ) module sensor is 64.8@xmath1610.6 mm@xmath2 ( 64.8@xmath16 5.3mm@xmath2 ) . it is a double sided processed `` n+ on n '' design . 
 this is a pixelated high dose n implantation in a lightly n - doped bulk material . 
 the backside is p - doped forming the pn junction . 
 the inter - pixel isolation is done with a moderated p - spray technique . 
 there are mainly two reasons for this choice : ( i ) after irradiation , the bulk material will be type inverted . 
 depletion will then begin at the structured n - side , allowing the device to be operated in a partially depleted mode and thus at a lower bias voltage . 
 ( ii ) a multiple guard ring structure on the p - side controls the voltage drop from the large negative bias voltage towards the sensor edge and allows to put all sensor edges to ground potential . 
 this enables a safe operation at very high bias voltages up to 600v . 
 the readout chip ( roc ) is fabricated in a commercial @xmath17 m 5 metal layer cmos process . 
 it s main purposes are    * amplification and buffering of the charge signal from the sensor * zero suppression in the pixel unit cell . 
 only signals above a certain threshold will be read out . 
 this threshold can be adjusted individually for each pixel by means of four trim bits . 
 the trim bits have capacitive protection against single event upset ( seu ) , which have shown to reduce seu by 2 orders of magnitude @xcite . 
 a typical threshold dispersion after trimming at t=-10@xmath18c is 90 electron equivalents with a noise of 170 electrons . 
 * level 1 trigger verification . hit information without a corresponding l1 trigger are abandoned . 
 * sending hit information and configuration data out to the tbm chip * adjusting various voltage levels and offsets in order to compensate for chip - to - chip variations in the cmos device parameters    the roc has 6 on chip voltage regulators . 
 this makes it possible to operate the detector without voltage regulator boards inside the cms tracker volume , improves ac power rejection and strongly reduces intermodule cross - talk . 
 more details about the roc can be found in @xcite . 
 the module is readout in a daisy chained scheme . 
 it is controlled by the token bit manager ( tbm ) chip . for each level 1 trigger 
 the tbm generates a token bit which controls 8 or 16 rocs . 
 one roc at a time sends its hit information through a lvds ( low voltage differential signal ) to the tbm chip where they are amplified and converted into a lcds ( low current differential signal ) . 
 the later has been chosen because of its low voltage swing , in order to reduce cross - talk on the kapton signal cable to the supply tube . 
 + there is one analog readout link running at 40mhz for each half module and each full module in the outermost layer and 2 such links for each full module in the two inner layers . in order to reduce readout time 
 , the pixel address is sent in a digital coded analog signal , i.e. there exist 6 discrete address levels . 
 the amplified sensor signal is sent purely analog . 
 each hit pixel needs 6 clock cycles or 150ns to be read out . 
 the address level separation has been measured with the entire system and was found to be @xmath1930 times the rms of the level width . 
 thus , reliable address decoding is ensured . 
 figure [ fig : signal ] shows a simplified diagram of the signal flow for the barrel pixel detector . 
 the signal path in the middle shows the fast detector control link . 
 the pixel front end controller ( pfec ) sends a clock signal with encoded fast control signals ( l1 trigger , reset , internal calibration and resynchronization signal ) to the detector . 
 the pfec also downloads configuration data at run start and if necessary during runs via the industrial i@xmath2c protocol , modified to run at a higher clock rate of 40mhz . 
 all connections between service tube and counting room are optical links . 
 the doh ( digital opto hybrid ) does the conversion between optical and electrical signals . 
 a pll chip regenerates the fast signals and restores the clock . 
 a delay chip can adjust the phase for each signal separately . 
 the gatekeeper chip blocks idle signals needed for automatic gain adjustment of the optical links from being transmitted to the module . 
 finally there is a lvds to lcds level converter chip on the end flange print . 
 + the path on the right shows the readout part . 
 the tbm drives the analog signal all the way to the service tube . 
 a level translator chip ( alt ) generates signal levels acceptable to the laser driver chips of the analog optical link . 
 driver and optical transmitter are located on the analog opto hybrid ( aoh ) . 
 the signal is received in the counting room by a vme front end driver unit ( pxfed ) @xcite . 
 it converts back to electrical signals , does a baseline correction , determines all pixel addresses and digitizes the analog pulse height . 
 it then passes this information to the cms daq system . 
 + some of these components need to be programmed . 
 this happens through a dedicated digital link via a standard i@xmath2c protocol . 
 the boxes in gray show pixel specific full custom auxiliary asics developed at psi . 
 barrel modules have been tested in a high rate 300 mev / c pion beam at psi . 
 figure [ fig : effi ] shows the detection efficiency as a function of particle fluence for trigger rates of 10 and 100khz . 
 three different methods have been used . for low trigger rates efficiencies 
 are shown for tracks reconstructed with a beam telescope or using small scintillators only . 
 the third method measures the efficiency for internal calibration signals which are superimposed on top of the beam induced data traffic . for comparison , 
 triangles show the efficiencies as expected from simulations . at high trigger rates 
 the data losses are dominated by readout related dead times . 
 the agreement between data and simulation is excellent here . for low trigger rates 
 the measurement shows @xmath20 higher inefficiency than expected from simulations . 
 this can be understood by radiation damage of the sensor under test . 
 + resolution studies have been made in @xcite . using pion beam test data together with simulations 
 , one expects a resolution in @xmath21 between 10 and 20 @xmath22 m for sensors irradiated up to @xmath23n@xmath24cm@xmath2 , which corresponds to the first 4 years of operation in the innermost layer . 
 the z resolution depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath26 and only weakly on the irradiation dose . 
 for @xmath27 the resolution is @xmath28 m , increasing to 40 @xmath22 m at @xmath29 . 
 an overview of the cms barrel pixel detector has been given . 
 the design is finalized and all system components have been tested extensively . the device is still in the construction phase and will be delivered to cms in summer 2007 .

87,"quantum phase transitions constitute a very active topic in theoretical physics @xcite , to which disorder and frustration of a quantum spin glass add considerable intricacies @xcite . 
 although quantum effects were usually considered to be negligible in spin glasses at finite temperatures , diverse experiments @xcite have proved them to be highly relevant , leading to the first experimental realization of _ quantum annealing _ @xcite . 
 one of the most widely employed theoretical approaches to the quantum spin - glass transition ( qsgt ) is the random couplings ising model in a transverse field ( ritf ) @xcite . within the analytical approach 
 , a griffiths phase was found in the 1d case via an elegant rg procedure @xcite , while such a structure was proved to be absent from the infinite range case within the replica formalism @xcite . 
 the 1d rg analysis was extended to study the presence of a certain number of long - distance links , proving the relevance of the perturbation @xcite . 
 regarding numerical approaches , quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) remains as the most suitable tool at @xmath0 . 
 using it , a coherent picture was obtained in the 2d and 3d cases , showing that the griffiths phase is present in 2d but absent in 3d @xcite . 
 classical spin glasses have been thoroughly analysed on bethe lattices @xcite . 
 however , finite bethe lattices are dominated by boundary effects and present no frustration . a way out is to study random graphs with a fixed connectivity which , in the classical case , allow the application of the _ cavity approach _ @xcite . 
 these random graphs present genuine frustration , since they have _ loops _ , and have no boundaries . on the other hand 
 , the average size of the loops grows with the number of sites @xcite , thus making them resemble , _ locally _ , a bethe lattice ( see figure [ graph : fig ] ) . 
 the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite is known to be a highly accurate method to analyze @xmath1 ground state properties of 1d or quasi-1d quantum many body systems , including tree structures @xcite . 
 we have extended the method in order to trace the behaviour of finite size samples of random graphs of fixed connectivity @xmath2 across the qsgt within the ritf model . given the high connectivity of these graphs , 
 the applicability of the dmrg is highly non - trivial . 
 it is remarkable that in the case of non - random couplings , we have found the number of retained states needed to ensure a good accuracy to be very high , rendering the application of the dmrg unfeasible .    the careful analysis of _ 
 pseudo-_critical points of finite size samples constitutes a powerful tool to study a qsgt . as a recent example , the work of igli and coworkers @xcite studies the distributions of , e.g. , the average entanglement entropy and the surface magnetization of finite size 1d samples . in this work 
 we provide measurements of , among other observables , spin - glass susceptibilities , energy gaps , long distance spin - spin correlations and entanglement entropies , and use them to obtain insight on the mechanism of the transition . 
 a full characterization of the qsgt , nonetheless , is not attempted in this work , since it would require to obtain statistics on a large number of disorder realizations . 
 the rest of the paper is organized as follows : sec . 
 [ model : sec ] presents the model , and sec . 
 [ dmrg ] provides details on the application of dmrg . 
 [ results ] shows the numerical dmrg results obtained . 
 [ conclusions ] presents a discussion of the results and some concluding remarks . 
 let us consider the random ising model in a transverse field ( ritf ) on a generic graph @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes pairs of neighboring sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 on the graph . 
 the values of @xmath7 are uncorrelated random variables with a uniform probability density distribution in the interval @xmath8 $ ] . 
 we will focus our study on randomly generated graphs , with @xmath9 sites and a fixed connectivity @xmath2 @xcite , i.e. , each site @xmath5 is connected to @xmath2 other ( randomly chosen ) sites @xmath6 . 
 an example of such a graph , with @xmath10 sites , is shown in fig . 
 [ graph : fig ] . 
 it should be noticed that , locally and for large @xmath9 , such graphs resemble _ bethe lattices _ , as we have highlighted with thicker links in fig .  [ graph : fig ] . nonetheless , the behaviour of finite bethe lattices is dominated by the boundary , unlike in our case , where there is none . moreover , trees have no loops and , therefore , present no _ frustration _ , while random graphs with fixed connectivity do contain loops and , therefore , have genuine frustration . 
 it has been proved , nonetheless , that short loops become rare as @xmath11 : more precisely , the probability of finding a loop of any fixed size @xmath12 falls to zero when @xmath11 @xcite . 
 the physics of classical spin glasses in these graphs has been studied using the cavity method by mzard and parisi @xcite . 
 let @xmath13 be the absolute value of the disorder - averaged energy per site of the classical ground state . 
 our numerical experiments show that it increases from @xmath14 at @xmath15 up to @xmath16 for larger @xmath9 , which is the theoretical limiting value for @xmath11 under the assumption that all links are satisfied . 
 we will take the product of eigenstates of @xmath17 , for all @xmath5 , as the _ canonical basis _ for our problem . in this basis 
 , we denote the state in which all spins point in the positive @xmath18-direction as @xmath19 . 
 let us assume , for the moment , that @xmath20 for all @xmath5 . for @xmath21 , all the non - diagonal terms in the hamiltonian vanish . 
 therefore , the ground state is given by the configurations with the classical minimum energy . 
 disregarding accidental degeneracies , there are two such configurations , related by a simultaneous flip of all spins , @xmath22 for all @xmath5 . 
 the transverse field @xmath23 may be considered as a _ kinetic energy _ coefficient , providing a hopping term among the classical configurations . in the @xmath24 
 limit the transverse field term dominates and the ground state tends to the state @xmath25 , with all the spins pointing in the positive @xmath18-direction , separated by a large gap @xmath26 from the first excited state . 
 let us remark that all the components of the canonical basis have the same amplitude in the state @xmath25 . 
 by decreasing @xmath23 there is a certain value @xmath27 for which the system undergoes a quantum spin - glass transition ( qsgt ) . for @xmath28 , 
 the system is in a quantum paramagnetic phase , which presents no long - range order . 
 below @xmath29 , the system is in a quantum spin - glass phase , presenting a hidden long - range order which may be detected by a number of observables . 
 we will focus here on the divergence of the _ spin - glass susceptibility _ : @xmath30 i.e. , physically , a small longitudinal magnetic field @xmath31 , applied at site @xmath6 , generates a magnetization response on each site @xmath5 , which is measured ( and squared , so as to disregard its sign ) ; the results are summed over all sites @xmath5 and averaged over all sites @xmath6 . if the system is in a paramagnetic phase , the magnetization will be proportional to @xmath31 and short - ranged in space , so that the sum over @xmath5 and @xmath6 yields a finite value for @xmath32 . on the other hand , on approaching the spin - glass phase , an infinitesimally small longitudinal magnetic field @xmath31 , localized at a single site @xmath6 , will eventually induce a finite magnetization over a long - range of spins . 
 this effect is at the origin of the divergence of @xmath32 . 
 we shall now discuss the numerical approach we have used to study this system , and the results obtained . 
 the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) has proved to be an accurate method to analyse the properties of 1d and quasi-1d systems @xcite . 
 the dmrg may be described as a variational method within the matrix - product states ( mps ) , which constitute a low - dimensional subspace of the full hilbert space @xcite . 
 a mps may be expressed as @xmath33 where each @xmath34 is a square matrix with dimension @xmath35 , which may be considered as the number of retained states per block when splitting the system into a left and right parts . 
 the total number of variational parameters is less than @xmath36 . 
 the success of the dmrg is related to the ability of these mps to reproduce faithfully the ground states of local 1d many - body problems for low values of @xmath35 @xcite . if @xmath37 , any state of the hilbert space may be exactly represented as a mps . 
 the minimum number of retained states @xmath35 is related to the exponential of the von neumann entanglement entropy of the dmrg block @xcite . in a non - critical 1d system , this entropy is bounded for all sizes , while it grows as @xmath38 for a 1d critical system of length @xmath12 . 
 it is believed that for a @xmath39-dimensional system out of criticality , the entanglement entropy scales as @xmath40 , where @xmath12 is the shortest spatial dimension of the system @xcite . 
 this estimate is known as the _ area law _ and is believed to have logarithmic corrections at critical points . 
 an important practical consequence is that , in order to study a 2d system , the number of retained states @xmath35 should grow as @xmath41 , thus making the dmrg very inefficient . 
 our system , on the other hand , is defined on a random graph of fixed connectivity , @xmath2 . 
 we will show that this poses no problem to the number of retained states @xmath35 , which appears to remain manageable even for @xmath42 as long as the couplings are random . 
 however , the implementation of the dmrg on such a model has required the following technical refinements of the original method :    * ( a ) path selection . * : :    in a non-1d system , dmrg proceeds by converting the system into an    effective 1d problem with long - range couplings . 
 a path is chosen along    the graph , which does not repeat sites , and is considered to be    appropriate if the number of broken links between the left and the    right blocks is kept low along a dmrg sweep . 
 normally , the selection    of a suitable path in a quasi-1d system ( e.g. ladders ) is done by    geometrical intuition . in our implementation 
 we have designed an    automated procedure : a simulated annealing algorithm is employed in    order to minimize the number of broken links . 
 the full problem of    finding the optimal path is computationally very hard . 
 therefore , we    do not aim at the exact optimum , but only to a reasonably good local    minimum . 
 we have noticed that our quasi - optimal path performs much    better than a random path . * 
 ( b ) perron - frobenius criterion . * : :    the hamiltonian of the ritf on any graph fulfills , on the canonical    basis , the conditions of the perron - frobenius theorem , i.e. , all    off - diagonal components are _ non - positive_. hence , all the ground    state components must have the same sign . using the mps representation    of the ground state 
 obtained within the dmrg , it is always possible to    reconstruct the amplitude of any configuration    @xmath43 . 
 the obtention of the full    @xmath44 is unfeasible , since it would require    reconstructing the amplitude of an exponentially large number of    configurations . 
 nonetheless , it is possible to pick up a few random    configurations @xmath45 , and check that all their amplitudes    have the same sign . 
 whenever this criterion was not met a rather rare    event , the calculation was repeated changing the random seed for the    lanczos procedure on the first dmrg step . * 
 ( c ) wavefunction annealing . 
 * : :    for large @xmath23 the ground state    @xmath25 is easily representable as a mps ,    requiring a single retained state . 
 the dmrg works extremely well in    this regime and , therefore , our simulations are always started well    within the paramagnetic ( large @xmath23 ) phase . 
 the qsgt    is approached by repeatedly decreasing the value of    @xmath23 by a small amount , always using the previous    ground state as a seed for the new calculation , exploiting the    wavefunction transformations suggested by white @xcite . 
 this type of    _ annealing _ of the ground state provides a faster convergence and more    accurate results for low @xmath23 . * 
 ( d ) adaptive number of retained states . * : :    the number of retained states @xmath35 , and the number of dmrg    sweeps @xmath46 , are not fixed in our algorithm . 
 we set a    maximum value for the sum of the neglected eigenvalues of the density    matrix in the rg truncation ( @xmath47 ) , and    select @xmath35 accordingly . 
 moreover , sometimes convergence    takes more sweeps than usual ( @xmath48 ) in order to obtain machine precision in the convergence of    the ground state energy . * 
 ( e ) energy gap measurements . * : :    when there is a symmetry in a problem , e.g. , under su(2 ) , it is    usually possible to obtain the first excited state as the ground state    of a different _ sector _ of the hilbert space . in our case , lacking    this , the best option has proved to be the following one . for each    dmrg step , after the ground state @xmath49 had been    found , it was `` promoted '' to a higher energy by the following    transformation of the hamiltonian :    +    @xmath50    +    in such a way that the ground state of this new hamiltonian is the    former first excited state , as long as we take    @xmath51 , @xmath52 being the gap we    are looking for . the density matrix used for truncation 
 was built as a    linear combination of the density matrices for each state , with equal    weights . 
 however , we should remember that only ground states of local    hamiltonians are expected to be faithfully represented by mps @xcite ,    and eq . 
 ( [ h.gap ] ) does not define a local hamiltonian . 
 therefore , the    accuracy in the gap estimate is worse than that in the ground state    energy and in other observables . 
 we have applied the modified dmrg technique to study a few samples of random graphs with fixed connectivity @xmath2 and sizes ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath42 . 
 a full characterization of the qsgt would require relevant statistics on the disorder . 
 unfortunately , in order to obtain a high accuracy for each sample , the required cpu - time is rather large . 
 therefore , we have decided to focus on a precise study of a few realizations , in order to gain insight on the mechanism of the transition for finite samples . 
 most of our findings will be illustrated in the figures of this section by showing in detail the results obtained for a sample with @xmath54 sites . 
 it should be remarked that the highlighted features are typical of all the ensemble . 
 the numerical simulations were done with the dmrg algorithm explained in section [ dmrg ] , with a neglected probability tolerance @xmath55 and a tolerance on the convergence of the energy of one part in @xmath56 , for ten samples of each size ( @xmath57 50 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 , 300 , 400 , 500 ) . 
 each sample is a different random graph , always with fixed connectivity @xmath2 , and the bonds @xmath7 are random and independent , uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath8 $ ] . 
 figure [ xsg : fig](a ) shows three observables calculated for a given instance of a @xmath54 graph , as a fuction of @xmath23 . 
 the most relevant quantity is the spin - glass susceptibility , defined in equation [ xsg ] . 
 a small magnetic field @xmath58 is applied at a single site @xmath59 , and the magnetic response is measured with the formula @xmath60 which is found to increase very fast as @xmath23 approaches @xmath61 from above , and thereupon saturating at a very high value . 
 figure [ xsg : fig](b ) proves the divergence of @xmath32 by showing its behavior at three different values of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) : the saturation value is seen to scale as @xmath66 . 
 we estimate the _ 
 pseudo-_critical value @xmath29 for the given sample as the value of @xmath23 at which the slope of the susceptibility attains its maximum . with this definition 
 , @xmath29 appears to be almost independent of the chosen site @xmath59 , at our level of precision @xmath67 . 
 figure [ xsg : fig](c ) , finally , shows @xmath32 for ten different samples with @xmath54 sites , differing in the graph structure and in the choice of the couplings @xmath7 , and diverging at different ( sample dependent ) values of @xmath29 . 
 figure [ xsg : fig](a ) also shows two other observables which point towards the same value for @xmath29 . 
 the first is the block entanglement entropy , defined as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the reduced density matrix for a part of the system . 
 it is measured for all the left - right decompositions along a dmrg sweep , and its maximum value is denoted by @xmath70 . 
 this value of @xmath70 is obviously dependent on the dmrg path . 
 nonetheless , since this path has been chosen so as to minimize the number of retained states , it is expected that it will also minimize the maximum value of the entropy . 
 it should be emphasized that this observable attains its maximum value , as a function of @xmath23 , at the same @xmath29 which is found by analyzing the spin - glass susceptibility . 
 the relevance of the entanglement entropy in order to characterize the critical point of a qsgt has already been remarked in the literature @xcite . 
 the dmrg , being based on the obtention and analysis of the density matrix of different parts of the system , is specially well suited for measuring this observable @xcite . 
 the other observable shown in figure [ xsg : fig](a ) is the energy gap @xmath52 , which extrapolates to zero at a value of @xmath23 which is close to @xmath29 . 
 the sign of the difference between these two pseudo - critical points is sample dependent . 
 this discrepancy is likely to be a finite size effect . 
 the next observable that we calculated for each sample is the average value of @xmath71 , see figure [ szzsx : fig ] . for high @xmath23 , 
 the transverse field is dominant , the ground state is close to @xmath25 and the value of @xmath71 is close to 1 . 
 as we decrease @xmath23 , this value is reduced . 
 it is remarkable that , at the value of @xmath29 defined by @xmath32 , and confirmed by the maximum block entropy , @xmath71 is never lower than @xmath72 , at variance with the 1d ritf , where it is normal to have values below @xmath73 .    also in figure [ szzsx : fig ] 
 we have plotted the behavior of the quantum equivalent of the @xmath74 order parameter , which measures the magnitude of the long - distance spatial correlations @xcite , @xmath75 our definition differs slightly from that used commonly in the literature on classical spin glasses . instead of the long - distance behavior 
 , we measure the global average behavior . 
 they are equivalent in a system with a bethe lattice topology because the number of neighbours of a given site at distance @xmath76 scales as @xmath77 . also note that these two observables , @xmath71 and @xmath74 have the advantage that they do not vanish trivially in the absence of external longitudinal magnetic field . 
 this quantity is close to zero within the paramagnetic phase , and takes a non - zero value inside the spin - glass phase . 
 figure [ szzsx : fig ] shows that the behaviours of @xmath74 and @xmath71 are highly correlated , both pointing to a pseudo - critical point which is , in many instances , sensibly lower than the one obtained with @xmath32 and @xmath70 . 
 this systematic discrepancy is not explainable in the framework of classical physics , since the fluctuation - dissipation theorem leads to the proportionality of @xmath74 and @xmath32 @xcite . in the quantum case , @xmath32 is not equivalent to @xmath74 , but to    @xmath78 ^ 2\ ] ]    where the integral is performed on imaginary time , from @xmath79 to @xmath80 . 
 therefore , in quantum spin - glasses , @xmath32 contains a contribution from time - correlations , while @xmath74 only measures spatial ones . 
 their different divergence points might suggest that long - distance correlations develop at a higher value of @xmath23 in time than in space .    at different sizes @xmath9 , 
 the behavior of the various samples is qualitatively similar , the only difference being the sample - dependent value of @xmath81 . 
 it is possible to construct histograms showing , for different @xmath9 , the probability distribution of the various @xmath81 . as a preliminary result 
 , we mark in figure [ gammac_vs_n : fig ] by empty circles the @xmath29 values obtained for 10 samples of different sizes : @xmath9=50 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 , 300 , 400 , and 500 . the crosses mark , for each size @xmath9 , the average values of @xmath81 , which apparently saturate at some point around @xmath82 .    a useful clue to the physics of this system across the transition is obtained by monitoring selected wavefunction components of the ground state as a function of @xmath23 , which can be easily done with the dmrg . 
 we illustrate this in figure [ wf : fig ] , for a sample with @xmath15 whose @xmath29 is marked by the arrow . 
 one of the monitored configurations is the classical ground state of the system . 
 ( naturally , there are two of them , related by a global spin - flip , which we denote by @xmath83 and @xmath84 . 
 they are obtained by measuring the values of @xmath85 at each site for very low @xmath23 under the presence of a very small longitudinal field @xmath86 that splits the degeneracy between them . 
 we will consider its weight to be the sum of their probabilities . ) 
 the weight of the classical ground state grows up to @xmath87 as @xmath23 is decreased . 
 a second monitored configuration is picked at random ( dashed lower line in figure [ wf : fig ] ) : the weight of such a random configuration is similar to that of all the others only for very large values @xmath23 , while it is definitely much smaller when @xmath23 approaches the pseudo - critical point . 
 the remaining monitored configurations in figure [ wf : fig ] are obtained by classical simulated annealing , i.e. , they are local minima of the classical energy . 
 these configurations maintain a high weight ( similar to that of the optimal configuration ) across the transition , up to a value of @xmath23 below which their weight decline markedly .    therefore , the number of relevant classical configurations contributing to the ground state changes drastically across @xmath29 . deep into the paramagnetic phase , 
 all of them have the same weight , coherently bound within the @xmath25 state . 
 this state retains a high weight at @xmath29 , as shown by the high values taken by @xmath71 at that moment . within the spin - glass phase 
 , the weight of the different configurations is gradually redistributed according to their classical energies , until eventually only the classical ground state remains . 
 it should be remarked that the dmrg was applicable in practice only in the case of random couplings . for random graphs with fixed values of @xmath88 ( either ferro or antiferromagnetic ) , the number of retained states needed for a similar accuracy increased in an order of magnitude , rendering impractical the calculations . 
 it should be remarked that a quantum phase transition may be observed exactly in the mps formalism with as few as two retained states per block @xcite . 
 the low values of @xmath70 measured in our system points to the fact that the number of states involved in the qsgt is reduced . 
 thus , in an attempt to explain the transition we might build a simple - minded ansatz consistent of a linear combination of only two states : the classical ground state @xmath89 and a _ background state _ containing the rest of classical configurations :      neglecting matrix elements which are exponentially small for large @xmath9 , there is a very sharp crossover at @xmath91 , from state @xmath92 to state @xmath44 . 
 this last state clearly presents a divergent spin - glass susceptibility . 
 the physics of our model is actually more complicated than this simple ansatz , as shown by the numerical estimate , @xmath93 for large @xmath9 . 
 an interesting question is how our system differs from the 1d ritf analyzed by fisher and coworkers @xcite . in 1d 
 , duality arguments and a detailed rg analysis give a value of @xmath29 satisfying @xmath94_{av}$ ] , where @xmath95_{av}$ ] indicates a disorder average . 
 this equation leads to values of @xmath29 much lower than those measured in our random graph case ( e.g. , for our distribution of @xmath7 , fisher s model yields @xmath96 , while in our case it reaches @xmath97 for @xmath42 sites ) . 
 the higher connectivity seems to make a large difference in that respect . 
 moreover , in our case , the value of @xmath71 at the transition is fairly high , about @xmath72 , while it is almost always below @xmath73 for ritf chains with the same sizes . 
 this means that the state @xmath25 is still dominant in the paramagnetic phase at the moment of the divergence of the spin - glass susceptibility .    in conclusion , 
 we have extended the dmrg to make it suitable to study the qsgt on random graphs . 
 the main technical innovations are the path - selection , which reduces the maximum number of retained states , and the wavefunction annealing , which allows to use the ground state for a certain value of @xmath23 as a seed to obtain the ground state for a lower value . 
 this modified dmrg algorithm has been applied to the measurement of the energy gap @xmath52 , spin - glass susceptibility @xmath32 , entanglement entropy @xmath70 , long - distance spatial correlations @xmath74 and average @xmath18-magnetization @xmath71 to high precision on a few samples of different sizes , ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath42 sites . 
 remarkably , @xmath70 attains its maximum at the same value of @xmath27 at which @xmath32 diverges . 
 this led us to consider this value as our candidate for the pseudo - critical point . 
 the energy gap @xmath52 vanishes in the surroundings of that value for all realizations . in most disorder realizations , @xmath74 and 
 @xmath71 start their crossover at a value of @xmath23 which is inferior to @xmath29 . 
 this may suggest that long - range temporal correlations develop at a higher value of @xmath23 than purely spatial ones . 
 we would like to emphasize that our definition of @xmath70 constitutes an alternative approach to the entanglement entropy on random graphs . 
 its relation to the standard block entropy , defined as the entanglement entropy obtained by tracing out a site and its neighbours up to a certain distance , remains as an open question . 
 we have also monitored the ground state probabilities of several classical low - energy configurations , showing that , as @xmath23 is reduced below @xmath29 , these probabilities increase exponentially until they attain a maximum value and then fall to zero , leaving the classical minimum energy configuration as the only ground state component as @xmath98 . 
 the fact that the model on such disordered graph was amenable to analysis within the dmrg is non - trivial . 
 both @xmath70 and the maximum number of retained states per block increase slowly with the system size . in a restricted sense , the system behaves similarly to a 1d chain , despite the high connectivity of the underlying graph . 
 this is a rather remarkable effect due to the disorder , which perhaps leads to the selection of an effective 1d path of strong bonds . 
 if the couplings @xmath88 are not random , we have found that the number of retained states per block increases in a much more pronounced way , rendering the numerical dmrg approach impractical . 
 it will be interesting and is left to a future study to understand quantitatively how the entanglement entropy at the transition behaves as a function of the system size , both for random and non - random couplings @xcite .","the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) has been extended to study quantum phase transitions on random graphs of fixed connectivity . as a relevant example

 the resulting quantum spin - glass transition has been traced down for a few disorder realizations , through the careful measurement of selected observables : spatial correlations , entanglement entropy , energy gap and spin - glass susceptibility , among others .",we will focus here on the divergence of the _ spin glass susceptibility _ i e physically a small longitudinal magnetic field applied at site generates a magnetization response on each site which is measured and squared so as to disregard its sign the results are summed over all sites and averaged over all sites. thus in an attempt to explain the transition we might build a simple minded ansatz consistent of a linear combination of only two states the classical ground state and a _ background state _ containing the rest of classical configurations neglecting matrix elements which are exponentially small for large there is a very sharp crossover at from state to state. for each dmrg step after the ground state had been found it was promoted to a higher energy by the following transformation of the hamiltonian in such a way that the ground state of this new hamiltonian is the former first excited state as long as we take being the gap we are looking for. we have also monitored the ground state probabilities of several classical low energy configurations showing that as is reduced below these probabilities increase exponentially until they attain a maximum value and then fall to zero leaving the classical minimum energy configuration as the only ground state component as. the main technical innovations are the path selection which reduces the maximum number of retained states and the wavefunction annealing which allows to use the ground state for a certain value of as a seed to obtain the ground state for a lower value. also in figure szzsx fig we have plotted the behavior of the quantum equivalent of the order parameter which measures the magnitude of the long distance spatial correlations our definition differs slightly from that used commonly in the literature on classical spin glasses. this modified dmrg algorithm has been applied to the measurement of the energy gap spin glass susceptibility entanglement entropy long distance spatial correlations and average to high precision on a few samples of different sizes ranging from to sites. a second monitored configuration is picked at random dashed lower line in figure wf fig the weight of such a random configuration is similar to that of all the others only for very large values while it is definitely much smaller when approaches the pseudo critical point. although quantum effects were usually considered to be negligible in spin glasses at finite temperatures diverse experiments have proved them to be highly relevant leading to the first experimental realization of _ quantum annealing _.  the hamiltonian of the ritf on any graph fulfills on the canonical basis the conditions of the perron frobenius theorem i e all off diagonal components are _ non positive_ hence all the ground state components must have the same sign,0.21245421245421242,0.0625,0.12454212454212453
88,"the idea of a statistical approach to hadron production in high energy collisions dates back to 50s @xcite and 60s @xcite and it has been recently revived by the observation that hadron multiplicities in collisions agree very well with a thermodynamical - like ansatz @xcite . 
 this finding has also been confirmed in hadronic collisions and it has been interpreted in terms of a pure statistical filling of multi - hadronic phase space of assumed pre - hadronic clusters ( or fireballs ) formed in high - energy collisions , at a critical value of energy density @xcite . in this framework , temperature and other thermodynamical quantities have a statistical meaning which does not entail the existence of a thermalised hadronic system on an event - by - event basis . 
 stated otherwise , statistical equilibrium shows up only when comparing many different events , whilst in each of them the gibbs law of equally likely multi - hadronic states applies . 
 so far , this proposed statistical cluster hadronisation model has been mainly tested against measured abundances of different hadron species for a twofold reason . 
 firstly , unlike momentum spectra , they are quantities which are not affected by hard ( perturbative ) qcd dynamical effects but are only determined by the hadronisation process ; indeed , in the framework of a multi - cluster model , they are lorentz - invariant quantities which are independent of the cluster s overall momentum . 
 secondly , they are quite easy to calculate and provide a very sensitive test of the model yielding an accurate determination of the temperature . however , in order to establish the validity of this approach , it is necessary to test further observables and to assess their consistency with the results obtained for multiplicities . 
 certainly , one of the best suited observables is the transverse momentum of identified hadrons , where transverse is meant to be with respect to beam line in high energy hadronic collision , and thrust or event axis in high energy collisions . 
 indeed , such projection of particle momentum is supposed to be the most sensitive to hadronisation or , conversely , the least sensitive to perturbative qcd dynamics . 
 + actually , it has been known for a long time that transverse momentum distributions are boltzmann - like in hadronic collisions and this very observation was pointed out by hagedorn as a major indication in favour of his statistical model of hadron production @xcite . 
 it must be emphasized that the prediction of a thermal - like shape in principle only applies to particles directly emitted from the hadronising source , whereas measured spectra also include particles produced by decays of heavier hadrons . 
 however , most analyses do not take into account the distortion of primordial hadronisation spectrum due the to hadronic decay chain and try to fit the data straight through it . 
 this problem has been discussed in literature @xcite and an analytical calculation has been developed to take into account the effect of two and three body decays @xcite , which has then been used both for pp @xcite and heavy ion collision @xcite including most abundant resonances . in this paper 
 we introduce a method allowing to rigorously and exhaustively determine the contribution of all particle decays . 
 hence , by taking advantage of this technique , we have performed an analysis of many measured transverse momentum spectra of identified hadrons in a wide range of centre - of - mass energies for several kind of collisions . 
 the statistical hadronisation model @xcite assumes that in high energy collisions , as a consequence of strong interaction dynamics , a set of colourless clusters ( or fireballs ) is formed having certain values of mass , volume , internal quantum numbers and momentum , the latter being inherited from the hard stage of the process . 
 those clusters are assumed to give rise to hadrons according to a pure statistical law in the multi - hadronic phase space defined by their mass , volume and quantum numbers . 
 this approach differs from another popular cluster hadronisation model @xcite mainly because it gives clusters a volume so that hadron production is ruled by the properly understood phase space rather than relativistic momentum space . in this framework 
 , the use of statistical mechanics and thermodynamical quantities , such as temperature , which need spacial dimension besides momentum space in order to be meaningful , is allowed . 
 we emphasize once more that the introduction of such quantities does not entail any thermalisation process of hadrons after their formation , nor the existence of a thermalised system event by event . + 
 although many clusters with different momenta , volumes , masses and quantum numbers are formed , it can be shown that the average values of many observables , e. g. particle multiplicites , are the same as those relevant to one equivalent cluster having suitable values of volume ( namely the sum of all cluster volumes measured in the rest frame of the equivalent cluster itself ) , mass and quantum numbers ( namely the sum of all cluster quantum numbers ) . 
 the proof of this statement @xcite , a lengthy one , requires the assumption of special probabilities governing the fluctuations of cluster masses and quantum numbers for a given set of volumes . 
 if the volume ( or mass ) of the equivalent cluster is large enough , it is then reasonable to take a canonical approach ( i.e. introducing a temperature ) in order to calculate mean quantities , instead of carrying out an involved microcanonical calculation . 
 therefore , even though actual clusters are small sized and microcanonical calculations would be needed to determine mean quantities within each of them , the choice of suitable mass fluctuation probabilities for the clusters allows one to calculate overall means dealing with only one large global structure and with much fewer parameters . arguing the other way around , it is not difficult to be convinced that the fluctuation probabilities to be chosen in order to achieve such reduction of the problem are exactly the same as those of obtaining a given set of masses by splitting a large cluster into a given number of clusters with volumes @xmath2 . 
 this statement extends a reduction procedure to the microcanonical case which was proved in the canonical case @xcite , where , from the very beginning , clusters were given temperature and volume instead of mass and volume . 
 nevertheless , it is not obvious how large the equivalent cluster should be for the canonical approximation to apply . for the present 
 , we have adopted a simple - minded _ a posteriori _ method consisting in justifying the canonical framework by its capability of accordance with the data . 
 a simple argument to support the canonical approximation even at moderate values of volumes is the very large number of states ( @xmath3 ) , i.e. hadrons and resonances , which can be excited in a hadron gas . + 
 as far as single - particle transverse momentum spectra are concerned , a similar reduction theorem from many clusters to one equivalent cluster in the averaging procedure applies @xcite , though only approximately . in general 
 , it can be shown that the _ primary _ spectrum of @xmath4 hadron species depends on transverse four - velocities @xmath5 with vanishing longitudinal component . ] of the @xmath6 clusters :    @xmath7     \ ; f(u_{t1},\ldots , u_{tn } ) \nonumber \\    & & \times \ ; \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\d n_j}{\d p_t}\vl_{i}(\ui ) \ , .\end{aligned}\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the transverse four - velocities distribution function . 
 if one expands all single - cluster spectra @xmath9 in series of @xmath10 starting from a common value @xmath11 for all clusters , it can be proved that , at the zeroth order , the spectrum in eq . 
 ( [ one ] ) becomes the same as that obtained for the aforementioned equivalent cluster , endowed with a tranverse four - velocity @xmath11 . 
 this reduction possibly allows taking the canonical approach in order to calculate the transverse momentum spectrum since the equivalent cluster size is much larger than single cluster s :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the temperature , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 are modified bessel functions . 
 ( [ two ] ) is the boltzmann limit of quantum statistics and it is a very good approximation for all hadrons except pions @xcite . for the zeroth order approximation in the @xmath10 expansion to be sufficiently accurate , the involved transverse four - velocities should be small , i.e. @xmath17 already for @xmath18 . since it is possible to choose the starting point @xmath11 of the series expansion to make the first order term vanishing @xcite , the largest neglected term turns out to be @xmath19 which is very small provided that the aforementioned condition on @xmath20 is met . 
 the analysis presented in this paper assumes the validity of this approximation and primary spectra have been calculated according to eq . 
 ( [ two ] ) . + 
 even though eq . 
 ( [ two ] ) looks like the spectrum from a thermalised source with a superimposed flow , a popular formula in the heavy - ion community , it is well worth emphasizing that in fact this formula has nothing to do with flow . 
 indeed , the average transverse four - velocity @xmath11 is not meant to be the mean value of cluster velocity distribution in a single event ; rather , it is the average transverse four - velocity of all clusters over all collision events . in other words , 
 @xmath11 may well arise from single clusters emitted at high @xmath21 in some events , e.g. following a hard parton scattering , and does not imply by any means a collective event - by - event expansion . 
 gev @xcite . 
 the measured @xmath22 spectra ( above ) have been normalised so as to have the same value at @xmath23 . 
 while slopes of @xmath22 spectra are different , those of @xmath24 ( below ) are approximately the same for all identified particles . ] 
 a peculiar prediction of a statistical picture in high energy collisions which is relevant to transverse momentum spectra is the so - called @xmath25 scaling : there should be an apparent common slope for @xmath26 spectra of identified hadrons at a given centre - of - mass energy . by looking at eq . 
 ( [ two ] ) one can easily realize that this holds in the limit @xmath27 . in principle 
 , @xmath25 scaling applies only to primary hadrons , namely those directly emitted from the hadronising source . on the other hand , as stated in sect . 
 1 , most observed or reconstructed particles in experiments arise from decays of heavier hadrons . 
 those secondary decays may well distort the primary spectrum shape , thus spoling @xmath25 scaling . 
 nevertheless , it can be seen in fig . 
 ( [ mtslope ] ) that @xmath25 scaling apparently also holds for measured final hadrons , at least in the examined collision , implying seemingly little distortion from primary to final spectrum . settling this and 
 other related issues demands a thorough analysis taking into account the effect of decays . 
 therefore , measured @xmath21 spectrum of the @xmath4 hadron species should be compared with the sum of its primary spectrum and the contribution arising from all heavier hadrons decaying into it :    @xmath28    whilst @xmath29 is given by eq . 
 ( [ two ] ) , the calculation of the second term in the right hand side of eq . 
 ( [ three ] ) within a statistical - thermal framework is a very complicated problem as the number of contributing resonances and decay modes is huge and also owing the presence of cascade decays ( e.g. @xmath30 ) . in refs . 
 @xcite an analytical approach has been taken including two and three body decays of directly emitted resonances . 
 on the other hand , we have adopted @xcite a mixed numerical - analytical method which allows a very accurate and exhaustive calculation . 
 our method can be summarised as follows : for any couple of hadrons @xmath31 , where @xmath32 decays into @xmath33 , either directly or through a cascade process , we have determined the momentum spectrum @xmath34 in the equivalent cluster s rest frame via a monte - carlo method by randomly generating 200,000 @xmath32 s decays , according to phase space , by picking @xmath32 s three - momenta from a thermal distribution with a given temperature @xmath14 :    @xmath35    then , we have boosted the obtained @xmath34 distributions in order to compute the @xmath36 for a given transverse four - velocity @xmath11 of the equivalent cluster , to be plugged into eq . 
 ( [ three ] ) , with an integral formula derived by the authors @xcite :    @xmath37    where f is the elliptic integral of the first kind and :    @xmath38    [ cols=""<,<,<,<,<,<"",options=""header "" , ]      +    the main advantage of formula ( [ five ] ) is to allow a quick computation of transverse momentum spectra associated with particle decays for any tranverse four - velocity once the corresponding momentum spectra at zero velocity are known . to obtain it 
 , we took advantage of the isotropy of @xmath34 distributions , which holds as long as decay products distribution is isotropic , which is true for simple phase - space decays with no polarisation . 
 the integration in the variable @xmath39 in eq . 
 ( [ five ] ) has been performed numerically . 
 the monte - carlo generation of @xmath34 spectra , depending on the temperature , has been performed for all unstable hadrons and resonances up to a mass of 1.8 gev and it has been repeated for temperature values between 140 and 190 mev in steps of 1 mev , so as to have a large enough range of temperatures where to search for minima in a fitting procedure . 
 for any other temperature value , the spectra have been calculated by means of a linear interpolation . 
 overall , for hadronic collisions , we have generated about 1200 spectra associated to 144 unstable hadrons for each @xmath14 value . 
 + the abundances of all hadrons , which are needed to assess the contribution of secondaries in the spectra of eq . 
 ( [ three ] ) , have been preliminarly set to the model values calculated by fitting the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath40 and or @xmath41 to the experimentally measured yields . 
 this procedure amounts to exclude the overall normalisation dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath14 in the fit so to keep only its shape dependence on @xmath14 . 
 + whilst the @xmath41 parameter has already extensively been used in multiplicity fits @xcite , a new parameter is introduced here for the strangeness suppression . 
 the particle yields are computed by constraining the number of newly created pairs to fixed integers which fluctuate according to a poissonian distribution . 
 the mean value of the poissonian distribution , namely the mean value of newly created pairs , is the adjustable fit parameter . for the present , this new parametrisation has been used only for hadronic collisions ( see table 1 ) because collisions present difficulties related to the production of heavy flavoured quarks which makes calculations extremely slow . 
 the mathematical features of the parametrisation are described in detail in ref . 
 + the fitted values , which update those in refs . 
 @xcite for hadronic and collisions are quoted in table 1 . 
 the fitted temperature in pp collision in the present analysis is somewhat lower compared with ref . 
 @xcite owing to an updated set of hadron parameters @xcite , an upgraded procedure of @xmath43 minimisation also taking into account correlations in the effective variance method @xcite , as well as the replacement of @xmath41 with . 
 the fitted temperature values show a very interesting trend consisting in a slight but significant increase as centre - of - mass energy diminishes ; this is in agreement with the observation pointed out in ref . 
 @xcite .

 the collisions and relevant centre - of - mass energies to be analysed have been primarily chosen on the basis of a fairly large number of measured particle yields and spectra . 
 particle multiplicities are needed to establish with some accuracy the contribution of secondary decays while many identified hadron spectra allow performing a test of universality on the slopes governed by @xmath14 and @xmath11 . 
 this criterion led to singling out mainly four collision systems for hadronic collisions : k@xmath48p at @xmath49 @xcite and 21.7 gev @xcite , @xmath45p at @xmath50 gev @xcite and pp @xmath51 gev @xcite . 
 for each identified particle transverse momentum spectrum , three free parameters have been determined by fitting eq . 
 ( [ three ] ) to the data : @xmath14 , @xmath11 and an overall normalisation parameter @xmath52 . 
 the fits have been performed in the variables @xmath21 or @xmath46 according to the available experimental spectrum ; henceforth , we will denote by @xmath53 both @xmath53 and @xmath54 . as we have mentioned before , overall multiplicities of hadrons in eq . 
 ( [ three ] ) have been fixed to model values by using fit parameters in table 1 . 
 + the fit is performed by minimising the following @xmath43 : @xmath55 ^ 2}{\sigma_i^2}\ ] ] the errors @xmath56 in the denominator of eq . 
 ( [ chi2 ] ) have been taken as the sum in quadrature of experimental errors and errors arising from the uncertainty on masses , widths and branching ratios of hadrons decaying into the examined hadron , according to the effective variance method ( see ref .

 once the normalisation parameter @xmath52 is fitted , a study of @xmath43 contour lines is performed in the @xmath44 plane in order to look for possible local minima . 
 indeed , the presence of several local minima along a band is a quite general feature of the @xmath43 ( see fig . 
 ( [ picont ] ) ) owing to the strong anticorrelation between @xmath14 and @xmath11 . 
 hence , different solutions are possible for the @xmath68 pair . in order to enforce universality of such parameters among different hadron species 
 we have chosen a solution for each particle according to the following procedure :    1 . 
 firstly , we have determined the contour lines of @xmath69 as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath11 by fixing all normalisation parameters to their fitted values , where @xmath6 is the number of different hadron species spectra for a given collision . 
 the minimisation of the sum of all @xmath43 s amounts to fit a common value of @xmath14 and @xmath11 for all measured hadrons . 
 secondly , among the different local minima we have chosen the one lying in or closest to the band defined by @xmath14 fitted with average multiplicities along with its error ( see figs . 
 ( [ gpcont],[kpcont],[ppcont ] ) ) . 
 finally , all single particle spectrum fits have been repeated seeking a local minimum as close as possible to the previously determined @xmath69 minimum . 
 it must be noted that this procedure aims at achieving the best agreement between temperatures determined by using different observables , namely particle yields and transverse momentum spectra . 
 the @xmath69 contour plots are shown in figs . 
 ( [ gpcont],[kpcont],[ppcont ] ) for the examined collisions . 
 there is a good agreement between the @xmath14 obtained from multiplicities and the location of minima in the @xmath44 plane . for k@xmath48p and @xmath45p at @xmath50 
 gev the absolute minimum lies nearly about the centre of the band demonstrating an intriguing correlation between the slope of transverse momentum distributions and the slope of average multiplicities as a function of mass . 
 moreover , the @xmath11 values turn out to be small , thus justifying the series expansion described in sect .  2 . 
 conversely , in k@xmath48p collisions at @xmath49 gev a clear disagreement emerges for k@xmath48p at @xmath49 gev between differently determined temperatures ( see fig . 
 ( [ kpcontlow ] ) ) which can be explained with the inadequacy of our used parametrisation at low energy where exact @xmath21 conservation , neglected in the canonical framework , is expected to play a significant role .

 the summary plots of the single particle fits are shown in figs . 
 ( [ summagp ] , [ summakp],[summapp ] ) while an example of fitted spectrum in pp collisions is shown in fig . 
 ( [ piplot ] ) . 
 in general , very good fits ( low @xmath43 s ) are obtained with good agreement between temperatures and average transverse boost velocities fitted for different identified hadrons , especially in pp collisions . 
 some discrepancies show up in k@xmath48p and @xmath45p collisions where k@xmath71 s seem to have slopes steeper than expected . 
 it must be noted that error estimates for @xmath14 and @xmath11 are still very rough . 
 we have also performed a similar analysis for collisions at centre - of - mass energies between 14 and 44 gev . compared with hadronic collisions , 
 the analysis of data presents several additional difficulties . 
 first of all , the production of heavy flavoured hadrons can not be neglected and the inclusion of many more decay channels is implied . a major issue is the fact that @xmath21 is defined with respect to the so - called thrust or event axis . 
 this direction is not known _ a priori _ , unlike in hadronic collisions where @xmath21 is defined with respect to the beam line , and must be determined on an event by event basis . 
 hence , whatever the algorithm being used , this very fact introduces a bias on transverse momentum spectra because momenta projection are used to determine the event or thrust axis itself ; often , this is done by just minimising the sum of particle @xmath21 s . 
 contour plot in the @xmath44 plane for charged tracks @xmath21 or @xmath46 spectra in collisions at four different centre - of - mass energies ranging from 14 to 44 gev . 
 the two vertical lines define the 1-sigma band corresponding to the temperature fitted by using average particle multiplicities . for collisions at @xmath47 44 gev , 
 local minima lie outside the considered @xmath11 upper bound and the minimum @xmath43 is poor . ]    in spite of this problem , we have repeated the same analysis performed for hadronic collisions by using measured charged tracks transverse momentum spectra @xcite with respect to thrust axis . 
 the @xmath43 contour plots are shown in fig . 
 ( [ eecont ] ) along with @xmath14 bands obtained from multiplicity fits and resulting @xmath43 s minima . 
 it can be seen that no minimum is found within the band for collisions at @xmath72 gev , a situation looking very similar that found in k@xmath48p collision at @xmath49 gev . 
 it is also found that fitted @xmath11 increases quite rapidly with centre - of - mass energy reflecting the rise of average @xmath21 of gluon radiation . since our parametrisation of transverse momentum spectra with an average transverse four - velocity @xmath11 requires @xmath11 to be @xmath73 ( see discussion in sect . 
 2 ) , it is quite natural that fit quality deteriorates as centre - of - mass energy increases . 
 this is indeed found already at 44 gev where @xmath74 can not longer be considered small . 
 as energy increases , particle @xmath21 spectra become sensitive to the shape of clusters @xmath75 distribution ( related in turn to radiated gluon @xmath21 spectrum ) and not only to its mean value . 
 further on , they become dominated by the shape of gluon radiation spectrum whilst hadronisation @xmath21 plays the role of a small superimposed noise . 
 the analysis of transverse momentum spectra of several identified hadrons , accurately taking into account the effect of hadron decays , indicates that they can be well reproduced within the statistical hadronisation model for several high energy hadronic collisions . 
 furthermore , a good agreement is found between the temperatures estimated by fits to average particles multiplicities and those extracted by fitting transverse momentum spectra . this can be seen especially by comparing figs . 
 ( [ gpcont],[kpcont],[ppcont ] ) ; in fact , the location of the best @xmath14 value for transverse momentum spectra , determined by @xmath43 s lowest contour line , is apparently correlated to the best @xmath14 value defined by particle multiplicities as spotted by the vertical band . 
 indeed , those temperatures move toghether from @xmath76 mev in pp collisions at @xmath47 27.4 gev to @xmath77 mev in @xmath45p and k@xmath48p collisions at @xmath47 21.7 gev . in our view 
 , this finding is a strong indication in favour of one of the key predictions of the statistical hadronisation model , namely the existence of a close relationship between the laws governing the production of particles as a function of their mass and , for each particle species , the production as a function of momentum ( measured in the rest frame of the cluster they belong to ) at the hadronisation . 
 + besides this main conclusion , there are many remarks to be made . 
 first of all , our calculations assumed a canonical framework and so they are expected to have only a limited validity at low centre - of - mass energies where the effect of exact transverse momentum conservation must show up . 
 indeed , in collisions at a centre - of - mass energy of 14 gev and k@xmath48p collisions at 11.5 gev , a clear disagreement is found between the temperatures determined in the two fashions ( see fig . 
 ( [ kpcontlow ] ) ) . secondly , 
 whilst the results obtained in pp collisions for different particles are in very good agreement among them , there are some significant discrepancies between different particles in @xmath45p and k@xmath48p collisions , especially for k@xmath71 s , which are not understood at the present . 
 finally , it is evident in the analysis of moderately high energy collisions , at @xmath47 44 gev , that our parametrisation of transverse momentum spectra as a function of an average transverse four - velocity alone , is not accurate enough . as the average @xmath21 of radiated gluons and , as a consequence , of hadronising clusters , rises , 
 particle spectra are influenced more by the shape of clusters transverse four - velocity spectrum than by primordial hadronisation @xmath21 spectrum so that more accurate calculations are needed involving perturbative qcd to perform such an analysis . 
 finally , in the very high energy regime , @xmath21 spectra become insensitive to hadronisation and , as a consequence , it is no longer interesting to study its properties . in summary , the presently used parametrisation of @xmath21 spectra is found to work well only in a limited centre - of - mass energy range ( roughly between 20 and 30 gev ) . at lower energies , the study of @xmath21 is still of great interest in probing the statistical features of hadronisation but complex microcanonical calculations are required . at higher energy , 
 hadronisation is swamped by hard qcd dynamics in @xmath21 spectra and all it can do is to add a little smearing .

 this finding indicates that in the hadronisation , the production of different particle species and their momentum spectra are two closely related phenomenons governed by one parameter .",our method can be summarised as follows for any couple of hadrons where decays into either directly or through a cascade process we have determined the momentum spectrum in the equivalent cluster s rest frame via a monte carlo method by randomly generating 200 000 s decays according to phase space by picking s three momenta from a thermal distribution with a given temperature then we have boosted the obtained distributions in order to compute the for a given transverse four velocity of the equivalent cluster to be plugged into eq. secondly whilst the results obtained in pp collisions for different particles are in very good agreement among them there are some significant discrepancies between different particles in and k xmath48p collisions especially for k xmath71 s which are not understood at the present. in our view this finding is a strong indication in favour of one of the key predictions of the statistical hadronisation model namely the existence of a close relationship between the laws governing the production of particles as a function of their mass and for each particle species the production as a function of momentum measured in the rest frame of the cluster they belong to at the hadronisation.  although many clusters with different momenta volumes masses and quantum numbers are formed it can be shown that the average values of many observables e g particle multiplicites are the same as those relevant to one equivalent cluster having suitable values of volume namely the sum of all cluster volumes measured in the rest frame of the equivalent cluster itself mass and quantum numbers namely the sum of all cluster quantum numbers . the monte carlo generation of spectra depending on the temperature has been performed for all unstable hadrons and resonances up to a mass of 1 8 gev and it has been repeated for temperature values between 140 and 190 mev in steps of 1 mev so as to have a large enough range of temperatures where to search for minima in a fitting procedure.  three with an integral formula derived by the authors where f is the elliptic integral of the first kind and cols options header the main advantage of formula five is to allow a quick computation of transverse momentum spectra associated with particle decays for any tranverse four velocity once the corresponding momentum spectra at zero velocity are known. for k xmath48p and at gev the absolute minimum lies nearly about the centre of the band demonstrating an intriguing correlation between the slope of transverse momentum distributions and the slope of average multiplicities as a function of mass. arguing the other way around it is not difficult to be convinced that the fluctuation probabilities to be chosen in order to achieve such reduction of the problem are exactly the same as those of obtaining a given set of masses by splitting a large cluster into a given number of clusters with volumes. the statistical hadronisation model assumes that in high energy collisions as a consequence of strong interaction dynamics a set of colourless clusters or fireballs is formed having certain values of mass volume internal quantum numbers and momentum the latter being inherited from the hard stage of the process. in general it can be shown that the _ primary _ spectrum of hadron species depends on transverse four velocities with vanishing longitudinal component,0.2547584187408492,0.0763582966226138,0.12005856515373353
89,"i would like to discuss in this talk three topics which superficially would look unrelated but in essence can be connected by the general theme of cheshire cat . 
 i will first look at two - nucleon systems in terms of macroscopic variables of qcd , namely hadrons ; i will then go back to an elementary hadron , in particular the proton and examine its microscopic structure by  punching "" a hole in the proton and then putting quarks and gluons of the appropriate quantum numbers inside and argue that there is a continuity in the descriptions in terms of hadronic variables and in terms of quark - gluon variables ; finally the continuity of quarks and hadrons at high density will be described in terms of qualitons  quark solitons . 
 many of my collaborators have contributed to the development discussed in this talk . among them are gerry brown , bengt friman , deog ki hong , kuniharu kubodera , kurt langfeld , hee - jung lee , dong - pil min , byung - yoon park , tae - sun park , vicente vento and ismail zahed . 
 consider two nucleon interactions at very low energy . 
 we are generically interested in the energy - momentum probe much less than the pion mass @xmath0 mev . at this energy , according to weinberg s  theorem , "" the content of qcd can be phrased in terms of the nucleons and pions . 
 in fact if we are probing a scale much less than the pion mass , we can even ignore the pions and work with the nucleons only . 
 the corresponding framework is an effective field theory ( eft ) . 
 much work has been done on this eft for two - nucleon systems  @xcite ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) . 
 there are two classes of observables to look at . 
 one is scattering process and the other is response function to external fields . 
 the two are of course complementary in revealing the physics involved . 
 recent efforts have been put more on scattering than on response functions although more information has traditionally been gained from the latter in nuclear physics . 
 both need to be treated simultaneously which i will do here .    in the literature 
 so far , there are broadly two approaches to eft in nuclear physics . 
 one is the original weinberg approach  @xcite where a systematic power counting is made only to the `` irreducible graphs , '' for which chiral perturbation theory ( with pions figuring crucially ) becomes applicable in organizing the expansion and the reducible graphs are summed to all orders with the irreducible graphs entering as vertices . 
 this scheme used in ref.@xcite  which in spirit is close to the original wilsonian eft but incurs possible errors in the power counting  involves a scale @xmath1 as the counting is applied only to the irreducible terms . 
 i will call this the @xmath2 counting . 
 the other approach  @xcite motivated to account more transparently for the large s - wave scattering lengths in two - nucleon scattering purports to do a systematic counting for the s - matrix as a whole which amounts to summing all graphs involving leading non - derivative four - fermi contact interactions while treating all others , including pion exchanges , as perturbation . 
 this approach renders a more systematic accounting of the powers of @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 as well as @xmath6 but at the expense of certain predictivity . 
 this is referred to as @xmath7-counting scheme . 
 there have been lots of hot debates as to whether one scheme is more powerful and or more consistent than the other , mainly in connection with the scattering  @xcite . 
 while the situation is not completely settled , i believe that it is fair to say that the two are both consistent with the tenet of eft and roughly equivalent in its power . eschewing the debate which seems somewhat academic , 
 i will simply focus on the @xmath2-counting approach in this talk . 
 in fact , in the processes that i will consider , i would claim that the @xmath2 counting is more adaptable to  and more predictive in treating 
 nuclear physics problems than the @xmath7 counting . 
 one great advantage of the @xmath2 scheme is that it allows one to calculate precisely defined corrections to what can be obtained from so - called realistic potential models ( pm in short ) that have been developed by nuclear theorists since a long time , thus giving the realistic potential models ( pm ) a first - principle justification . 
 it allows us to study processes involving not just few - body but also many - body systems . 
 for instance , it is possible to calculate the 
 hep "" process in the sun @xmath8 ( which is currently an exciting issue after the recent surperkamiokande neutrino data ) with an accuracy that can be controlled systematically . 
 it has also been successfully applied to calculating axial charge transitions of heavy nuclei ( see @xcite ) with the additional ingredient of br scaling  @xcite . 
 while there is no definitive evidence that the @xmath2 scheme is fully justified for n - body systems with @xmath9 , it definitely works for @xmath10 systems . in ref.@xcite , it has been shown in a cutoff regularization ( with a finite cutoff as required by eft  @xcite ) that the eft results of the leading order terms in all two - body observables at low energy @xmath11 are precisely reproduced by the potential model results . 
 this is the case not only for scattering amplitudes but also all electroweak response functions . 
 what eft brings in addition to what we get from the pm is a systematic procedure to compute corrections to the leading order results . for low - energy processes , this status of the pm can be understood by the fact that the tail of the wave functions is a physical quantity and the realistic potential models which are fit to experiments have the _ correct _ asymptotic properties in the wave function . this point has also been stressed and clarified by phillips and cohen in a recent important paper  @xcite . 
 considered to order @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the order in the @xmath2 counting ( which i will consider relative to the leading order term in the expansion of the irreducible graphs ) , the s - wave scattering amplitudes are accurately postdicted  @xcite up to @xmath14 for @xmath10 and a cutoff appropriate to the number of pions exchanged ( one or two ) in the irreducible graphs . 
 deuteron properties are also well understood within the same scheme  @xcite . 
 the scheme allowed the calculations to order @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the proton fusion process in the sun  @xcite p+pd+e^+ + _ e[pp ] and of the threshold np capture  @xcite with polarized projectile and target nucleons + d+.[np ] the process ( [ pp ] ) crucial for the solar neutrino problem is given in the scheme to an accuracy of @xmath17 percents ( the uncertainty here is due to the exchange current that appears at order @xmath16 ) . 
 the unpolarized cross section for ( [ np ] ) has been computed to the accuracy of 1 percent in a complete agreement with the experiment . 
 more significantly , the polarization observables @xmath18 ( circular polarization ) and @xmath19 ( anisotropy ) have been predicted _ parameter - free _ in ref.@xcite scheme was made by chen , rupak and savage  @xcite . ] . 
 this is a genuine prediction since there are no experimental data available . 
 ( they are currently being measured in ill of grenoble  @xcite . )    in all these postdictions and predictions , there is very little @xmath2 dependence as required by the tenet of eft . 
 this is a clear indication that the scheme is fully consistent . 
 one can go up in the momentum range by doing higher order calculations . 
 phillips and cohen  @xcite discuss how the two - body em form factors can be described in the @xmath2 scheme . pushing somewhat the validity of the scheme 
 , one can calculate even the process e+de+n+p involving large momentum transfers @xmath20 gev . 
 in fact this process measured in 1980 s at als of saclay and elsewhere is considered to be the _ unambiguous _ confirmation of meson - exchange currents in nuclei ( see  @xcite ) . 
 counting , everyone ( ! ) in the audience chuckled and said the process is completely out of reach for eft ( see @xcite ) . 
 i grant that this may be true in the @xmath7 scheme at least for the moment but _ not _ in the @xmath2 scheme where it has worked stunningly , confirming the  chiral filter hypothesis . "" _ voil _ the power of the @xmath2 scheme ! ] 
 the nucleons that figured in the above section were color - singlet point - like fields that say nothing explicit about quarks and gluons . 
 let me now imagine puncturing a hole of size of radius @xmath21 in the proton and populating the inside with the qcd degrees of freedom , quarks and gluons . how to do this consistently with qcd 
 is known and the model involved is the chiral bag ( this is described extensively in  @xcite ) which consists of a quark - gluon sector inside the bag and a color - singlet hadronic sector outside , with the two sectors connected by suitable boundary conditions . 
 when constructed with relevant degrees of freedom and in consistency with the symmetries of qcd , the model gives what is now called 
 cheshire cat . "" in short , the cheshire cat principle  @xcite states that at low energy , physics involving hadrons should be independent of the bag size @xmath21 . 
 it has been shown that this principle is operative semi - quantitatively in _ all _ properties of the nucleon  @xcite _ except for _ the flavor - singlet axial charge ( fsac ) of the proton which is related to the  proton spin . 
 "" here i will briefly describe  leaving the details to the paper by lee et al  @xcite  how this cheshire cat property can be recovered in the fsac when chiral symmetry and chiral anomaly are judiciously taken into account . 
 it turns out that the interplay between the boundary conditions and casimir effects plays a crucial role .    since the flavor - singlet axial current 
 is not conserved because of the anomaly , the color can not be confined inside the bag unless a suitable boundary condition is put at the surface that cancels the outflow of the color  @xcite . 
 the boundary term that does this is proportional to the chern - simons current on the surface , i.e. , the chern - simons flux ( which is invariant under neither small nor large gauge transformation ) . 
 this influences the fsac of the proton nontrivially . 
 briefly , what happens is that the fsac contributed by the matter fields ( quarks inside the bag and @xmath22 outside the bag ) and the fsac contributed by the gauge field ( gluons inside the bag ) more or less ( or possibly exactly if treated rigorously ) cancel , leaving behind only the small contribution from the ( gauge field ) vacuum fluctuation which is effectively a casimir effect caused by the boundary with its color - anomalous boundary condition . 
 the cancellation and the remnant small fsac are shown in fig . 
 [ fsac ] .    the upshot of the small result left over which is independent of the size @xmath21 provides yet another compelling evidence that the proton could be equivalently understood _ both _ in terms of quarks / gluons and in terms of macroscopic hadronic variables . 
 when @xmath21 is taken to be big , it is the qcd variables that take over , e.g. , the mit bag . when the size @xmath21 is shrunk to a point , the proton is a skyrmion . 
 thus we have the equivalence of the skyrmionic proton and the quark - gluonic ( qcd ) proton , that is , the cheshire cat . 
 since there is no way one can exactly bosonize four - dimensional qcd , the equivalence can not be made exact . 
 we simply have an approximate equivalence which can be made more precise by doing more work . 
 what determines the language to use is the kinematic condition of the process one looks at . 
 the last topic i would like to discuss is infinite nuclear matter at large density . the old lore that at an asymptotic density , the matter can be described by perturbative qcd with weakly interacting boring quarks is simply wrong 
 what may be happening at high density is something a lot more exciting than that . 
 this explains why lots of people are presently writing papers about it . 
 what is most surprising and in some sense unexpected is that at high density the cheshire cat picture becomes more prominent . 
 in fact , at high density , there ceases to be any real distinction between quarks and hadrons . 
 this can be best seen in terms of a quark soliton analogous to the qualiton kaplan  @xcite introduced as a model for the constituent quark . 
 the mechanism i will discuss exploits that at high density diquarks condense giving rise to color superconductivity as recently discussed in the literature  @xcite . since the resulting qualiton is formed from a color superconducting ground state , it seems proper to call it superqualiton  @xcite . 
 it has been argued on general symmetry and dynamical grounds  @xcite that at high density , hadronic matter of flavor @xmath23 is characterized by the condensate = - = ^ij^abi_i [ 1 ] where @xmath24 is some constant , @xmath25 are @xmath26 indices , @xmath27 are color indices , and @xmath28 are flavor indices . 
 equation ( [ 1 ] ) holds for parity - even states . 
 such a condensate locks color and flavor so that global color and chiral symmetry are broken to the diagonal subgroup @xmath29 . 
 the consequence of this is that there is an invariant @xmath30 subgroup that contains a  twisted "" photon , measured with which all excitations carry integer charges reminiscent of the han - nambu quarks and have quantum numbers that correspond to those of the mesons and baryons present at zero density . 
 there is then a continuity between the excitations at high density in terms of quarks and gluons and hadronic excitations at low density in terms of baryons and mesons . 
 this clearly is a case of cheshire cat .    now to see that this is the cheshire cat in the sense formulated in terms of the chiral bag  @xcite , consider the excitation of a quark on top of the diquark - condensed  vacuum . "" in @xcite , such a quark is argued to behave like a baryon . 
 now i claim that this quark is a quark soliton , i.e. , superqualiton  @xcite .    to describe the low - energy dynamics of the color - flavor locking phase , introduce a field @xmath31 which maps space - time to the coset space , @xmath32 . 
 one can take it to be @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the anomalous dimension of the diquark field of order @xmath35 and @xmath36 denotes the quark field with momentum close to a fermi momentum @xmath37 . 
 the pairing involves quarks near the opposite edge of the fermi surface . 
 similarly , we introduce a right - handed field @xmath38 , also a map from space - time to @xmath39 , to describe the excitations of the right - handed diquark condensate . if this field takes a vacuum expectation value as a consequence of the diquark condensation which will , owing to ( [ 1 ] ) , have the form = -= _ a , then 16 nambu - goldstone bosons will get excited  . 
 eight of them will get eaten up by the gluons to give masses to the gluons . 
 the massive gluons then turn into massive vector mesons whose quantum numbers are those of the light - quark vector mesons present at zero density . 
 the remaining eight ( pseudoscalar ) nambu - goldstone bosons are the equivalents of the ones present at zero density and are represented by the interpolating field ( [ u ] ) . in analogy to the usual skyrmion at zero density , this field supports a soliton which is a fermion , the quantum numbers of which are identical to those of the usual baryon . 
 the effective lagrangian that gives rise to this soliton should in principle be derived from qcd with the help of renormalization group flows toward the fermi surface of high quark density . 
 such a derivation would determine the parameters that figure in the effective lagrangian such as the  pion decay constant "" @xmath40 etc which would carry information on the superconductivity gap etc . at the moment 
 such an effective lagrangian is not known , so a detailed study of it excitation structure can not be discussed . 
 however one can venture to make a few interesting conjectures . 
 viewed as a superqualiton whose mass is given by the soliton mass , there is nothing that requires that the soliton mass be equal to or near the superconductivity gap @xmath41 ( which is dictated by the condensate ) . 
 in fact there is nothing which would prevent the mass from being much less than the gap . 
 thus one could imagine that light fermions are excited _ within _ the gap . 
 correlations between light superqualitons could rearrange the ground state into a different form from that of the standard superconductivity . 
 for this reason the phenomenon of color superconductivity in qcd at high density could be completely different from the usual bcs superconductivity . 
 a similar point in a different context was raised in @xcite . 
 the most important outcome of the recent development of eft in nuclear physics is that the highly successful approach to nuclear structure using realistic nuclear potentials ( pm ) is rendered a first - principle interpretation in that it represents the leading term in the eft expansion with the corrections thereof systematically calculable . 
 this confers the power of modern field theory techniques to the standard nuclear physics approach that has been practiced with success since a long time . 
 i am suggesting that this 
 bridging "" comes about thanks to a possible duality between qcd variables and macroscopic ( color - singlet ) variables that i refer to as the cheshire cat principle . 
 the  proton spin problem "" is an illustration of this in the basic structure of the hadron . 
 it is amusing that the notion of the cheshire cat which was conceived by the need to reconcile the traditional meson - exchange description with the modern qcd description for nuclear processes  @xcite ( i.e. , the  little bag "" with pion cloud , chiral bag etc ) at low density re - emerges at high density where one would have expected the bona - fide qcd to be uniquely applicable .

90,"magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in astrophysical plasmas and is believed to be responsible for a wide range of solar phenomena , including solar flares ( for a review see * ? ? ? 
 unfortunately , magnetic reconnection occurs on spatial scales that are too small to be resolved with current solar instrumentation and can not be observed directly . 
 there is , however , considerable indirect evidence that magnetic reconnection plays a central role in solar flares . 
 perhaps the most compelling piece of indirect evidence is the supra - arcade downflows that have been observed above many post - flare loop arcades ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 these downflows appear to be related to highly non - potential field lines that have reconnected and are propagating away from the current sheet . 
 supra - arcade downflows have been observed with a number of instruments and their properties are summarized in the comprehensive review by @xcite . 
 the downlows often appear as dark , collapsing features that look like small `` tadpoles '' ( voids with a trailing dark tail ) . 
 some downflows have a loop - like appearance while others appear to evolve from voids into loops . 
 the downflows generally begin at relatively high velocities ( 100200 km  s@xmath1 is typical ) and then quickly decelerate to about 4 km  s@xmath1 . observations at high spatial resolution give the impression that much of high temperature plasma in a flare is formed from collapsing loops @xcite , even when individual features can not be tracked . 
 similar features are observed in the outer corona when the streamer belt is viewed face on ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 despite the extensive analysis of previous observations a number of questions remain regarding the downflows and their relationship to magnetic reconnection . 
 the initial velocities measured for the downflows tend to be much smaller than the estimated alfvn speed in the lower corona ( @xmath01000 km  s@xmath1 ) , the velocity expected for reconnection outflows . 
 it is possible that the downflows are formed at large heights and are observed only after they have experienced some deceleration . in most models of solar flares 
 the release of energy in the corona ultimately drives chromospheric evaporation and leads to the formation of hot , dense loops ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 many of the downflows , however , are observed as dark features and it is not clear that all of the high temperature emission in the flare is formed from descending loops . finally , why some downflows appear as voids and while others appear as loops is unclear . 
 it is possible that the observed morphology is strongly influenced by the viewing angle . 
 the launch of the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) on the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( _ sdo _ ) provides a new opportunity to investigate the dynamics of newly reconnected flux tubes in solar flares . 
 aia has several advantages over previous solar euv imagers , including a higher cadence ( 12s ) and more channels that observe at flare temperatures . 
 the higher cadence allows us to create data sets optimized for observing the downflows at large heights . 
 the aia 94  and 131  channels observe emission from and , respectively . 
 these lines are formed close to 10mk , the temperature at which the flare emission measure generally peaks . 
 observations from the twin _ stereo _ spacecraft @xcite can also be applied to this problem . during the 20102012 time frame the spacecraft 
 are approximately 90@xmath2 from the earth - sun line , which allows flares to be observed simultaneously as limb events by aia and disk events by the euvi imagers on _ 
 stereo_.    in this paper we report new observations of supra - arcade downflows taken with aia and euvi . with the improved capabilities of aia we are able to track features at larger heights and in much weaker events than in previous studies . 
 the combined aia and euvi observations provide compelling evidence that the downflowing voids and loops are manifestations of the same phenomenon observed along different lines of sight . 
 we find , however , that the initial velocities are consistent with previous measurements and well below the estimated alfvn speed . 
 the relationship between the brightest emission in the flare and the downflows is also not resolved . 
 we find no evidence that the emission from the downflows rises with time , as would be expected from chromospheric evaporation . 
 also , for these events the initial high temperature flare loops are observed to form almost `` in place '' with very little associated downward motion . 
 these difficulties suggest that simple two - dimensional models of magnetic reconnection can not be applied directly to detailed observations of solar flares . 
 the aia instrument on _ sdo _ is a multilayer imaging telescope . 
 a full description of the instrument is given in @xcite . in brief 
 , the aia instrument images the full sun in 10 different channels with 0.6  pixels at a typical cadence of 12s . 
 there are 7 euv channels for imaging emission from the transition region and corona . 
 the aia 94 , 131 , and 193  channels observe flare emission from , , and , respectively . 
 each of the channels is also sensitive to emission formed at cooler temperatures . 
 the 193  channel includes 195 , which is an intrinsically bright line and makes difficult to observe in smaller events . 
 the lower temperature response for the 131  channel is primarily from emission lines that are much weaker than 195 , making the high temperature emission much easier to observe . 
 the lower temperature lines in the 94  bandpass are largely unidentified , but they are also relatively weak . for a more complete description of the aia temperature response see @xcite . 
 all of the aia data that we have analyzed are sub - fields of the full disk images obtained from the lmsal cutout service . 
 the data has been processed using ` aia_prep ` to remove any energetic particle spikes and co - register the images from the different wavelengths to a common plate scale .    for this work 
 we consider three flares that occurred at the solar limb as viewed from earth : a c3.8 event that began at about 18:00 ut on 2011 march 16 , a c5.4 flare that began at about 20:30 ut on 2011 may 9 , and a c2.1 flare that begin at about 18:00 ut on 2011 may 18 . 
 the soft x - ray light curves from the _ goes _ 15 spacecraft are shown in figure  [ fig : goes ] . 
 the _ goes _ light curves indicate that these flares are all long duration events that evolve over many hours . 
 some representative aia 131  images are shown in figures  [ fig : stereo0 ] , [ fig : stereo1 ] , and [ fig : stereo2 ] . 
 all three events are clearly associated with a coronal mass ejection and have the classic morphology of a two - ribbon flare . 
 each event shows a diffuse `` cloud '' of high temperature ( @xmath010mk ) plasma that rises with time . over time relatively narrow , lower temperature ( @xmath01mk ) loops form at the lowest heights and material is observed to drain back down to the surface of the sun along these loops . 
 the temperatures that we give here are approximate and based on comparisons with previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 high temperature emission is observed only in the 94 and 131  channels while only low temperature loops are observed in channels such as 171 , which has a significant response only at low temperatures . 
 very little emission is observed in the 193  channel images for these flares . 
 the _ goes _ soft x - ray fluxes for these events are approximately 100 times smaller than was observed in the x - class flares considered previously ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) , so this is not surprising . 
 movies of the data for each event show evidence for features forming at large heights and descending onto the accumulating post - flare loop arcade . 
 these features are generally difficult to track in the raw intensity images . to eliminate the contribution of the more slowly varying emission it is useful to compute running difference images . with the high cadence of aia we have considerable flexibility in constructing these images . through trial and error 
 we have found that averaging sets of 7 images taken 72s apart produced the best results . 
 since the downflows move at relatively high velocities , too much averaging or too long an interval between frames blurs the features . averaging fewer frames or choosing a shorter interval between frames leads to noisier difference images . 
 example running difference images are displayed in figures  [ fig : stereo0 ] , [ fig : stereo1 ] , and [ fig : stereo2 ] . 
 movies of the running difference images , which are available in the electronic version of the manuscript , show the downflows much more clearly than the raw intensity images . 
 in general , the downflows appear as dark features in the running difference images , indicating that they are dark relative to the emission into which they are descending .      in the march 16 event 
 all of the downflows appear as elongated loop - like features . 
 as illustrated in the example shown in figure  [ fig : examples ] , when the loops first appear they are relatively broad but they are compressed as they descend . 
 many of the descending loops that are the easiest to observe appear relatively late in the event ( after approximately 20:00 ut ) . at earlier times , 18:2019:00 ut for example , high temperature emission appears at relatively low heights very suddenly and does not appear to descend from larger heights . 
 the loops that appear near 18:30 ut and are shown in the first column of figure  [ fig : stereo0 ] illustrate this . 
 there is , however , some downward motion after the emission appears , consistent with the shrinkage of post - reconnection loops ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . 
 some of the downflows in these events are observed as dark voids during the entirety of their descent . 
 this is true for almost all of the downflows observed in the may 9 event . as with the loops observed in the march 16 event , the voids are relatively wide when they appear and are compressed in size as they descend . 
 an example downflow is shown in figure  [ fig : examples ] . 
 the timing of the downflows is similar to that of the march 16 event , with many of the most easily observed downflows being observed somewhat later in the evolution of the flare . 
 many downflows are observed after 21:15 ut , which is after the peak of the _ goes _ soft x - ray flux .    in the may 18 event a mixture of descending voids and loops is observed . 
 for this flare there are also some downflows that evolve from voids into loops . 
 an example of a downflow that begins as a void and evolves into a loop is shown in figure  [ fig : examples ] . 
 the earliest high temperature emission in this event is also observed to appear very suddenly at low heights without any downward motion as the loops brighten . after these loops appear , they do to contract downward to lower heights . 
 as in the march 16 flare , most of the downflows that are easily observed appear after the peak of the soft x - ray emission . 
 the _ stereo _ observations suggest that the orientation of the may 18 event is particularly interesting . 
 the third panel of figure  [ fig : stereo2 ] shows that the post - flare loop arcade forms an `` @xmath3 '' shape , with part of the `` @xmath3 '' oriented parallel to the line of sight and another part oriented perpendicular to it . 
 when the axis of the arcade is along the line of sight the downflows appear as loops or as voids that transition to loops . 
 _ stereo _ observations indicate that the other events are consistent with this interpretation . 
 the arcade in the march 16 event is oriented at an angle to the line of sight and loops are observed ( see figure  [ fig : stereo0 ] ) . 
 the arcade in the may 9 event is essentially perpendicular to the line of sight and only voids are observed ( see figure  [ fig : stereo1 ] ) .    for each event we also inspected the 94  images . 
 as noted earlier , this channel includes a strong emission line and is sensitive to somewhat lower temperature plasma than the 131  channel . as one would expect , these images tend to show the somewhat cooler plasma at the lower part of the arcade and as a result tend to show the terminal phase of the downflows . for this reason we focus on the data from the aia 131  channel in this paper .

 these maps are formed by extracting a narrow `` slit '' from each image and stacking them horizontally as a function of time ( see * ? ? ? 
 interpolation is used to extract intensities at arbitrary angles . 
 an example height - time map computed from the difference images is shown in figure  [ fig : ht0 ] . here 
 the downflows are evident as dark tracks , indicating that the downflows are generally less intense than the emission into which they are descending .    to characterize the kinematics of the downflows we fit selected height - time tracks to a function of the form @xmath4 with this assumption the velocity of the downflow as a function of time is @xmath5 and the acceleration is @xmath6 this functional form for the height captures the rapid transition from a relatively high initial velocity of @xmath7 at a height of @xmath8 , to a relatively slow terminal descent , @xmath9 . 
 note that for features that descend at progressively slower speeds the initial velocity will be negative and the acceleration will be positive . 
 we have selected approximately 10 downflows from each event and traced out their tracks in the height - time maps . 
 the best - fit parameters for equation  [ eq : h ] were determined for each track using a least - squares algorithm and are given in table  [ table : inflows ] . 
 each track is also indicated in the movies included in the electronic version of the manuscript . 
 we tended to select high velocity tracks that appeared at relatively large heights since they were easier to track and are more relevant to the initial dynamics of post - reconnection flux tubes . 
 many of the tracks that we selected decelerate quickly and could not be followed for long periods of time . 
 this means the asymptotic behavior is not well observed for these tracks . if we leave @xmath9 as a free parameter in the fitting of these tracks the terminal velocity often converges to relatively large number , inconsistent with the general trend in the data . for tracks that do have a well observed terminal phase , the terminal velocity is typically about 45 km  s@xmath1 . since the terminal velocities are generally small and we are more interested in the initial dynamics we have forced @xmath10 for the final fits given in table  [ table : inflows ] .    with the improved imaging capabilities of aia we anticipated being able to track downflows at larger heights above the solar surface . comparing the values for @xmath8 
 given in table  [ table : inflows ] with figures 6 from @xcite we see that is the case . 
 our median initial height is approximately 111 mm compared with 82 mm with the earlier data . 
 our initial velocities and accelerations , however , are very similar to those presented by @xcite in their figure 5 . for the initial velocity 
 we have a median value of -144 km  s@xmath1 compared with -146 km  s@xmath1 in @xcite . 
 our median initial acceleration is 0.68 km  s@xmath11 compared with 0.42 km  s@xmath11 . 
 thus it appears that small initial velocities relative to the alfvn speed are not an artifact of the lower heights at which the downflows have been observed previously . 
 chromospheric evaporation is an essential component of solar flares models based on magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 the release of energy on reconnected field lines will ultimately lead to the heating and evaporation of chromospheric material . 
 this should lead to loops that brighten over time and numerical simulations suggest that this process should occur rapidly ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 one limitation of the running difference images is that they can obscure the evolution of the absolute intensities . 
 the downflows are dark features in the running difference images , indicating that they have lower intensities than the surrounding emission . 
 it is not clear , however , if they remain dark in an absolute sense or brighten over time .    to address this issue 
 we have followed the intensities along each track in the unsubtracted images . 
 for comparison we also determined intensities at several locations outside of the track . in all cases the intensity in the center of the feature simply tracks the background intensities measured outside of the downflow . 
 there is no evidence for the intensities in the downflows rising faster than the background . 
 unfortunately , these measurements are difficult to make and subject to considerable uncertainty . 
 the downflows have a very low contrast relative to the ambient emission in the flare . 
 the difference images shown in figures  [ fig : stereo0][fig : ht0 ] are all scaled over a range of about @xmath125dn  s@xmath1 , which is typically only a few percent of the absolute intensity . 
 we have presented the first observations of supra - arcade downflows with the aia instrument on _ sdo_. with the new capabilities of aia we are able to track inflows at much larger heights and for much smaller events than in previous observations . 
 these observations provide many new examples of features forming at large heights and descending onto the accumulating post - flare loop arcade . 
 the dynamics and morphology of the downflows provides compelling evidence for the role of magnetic reconnection in eruptive solar flares .    despite the qualitative agreement between the observations and the standard picture of magnetic reconnection 
 , there are several problems that remain . 
 the low velocities that are observed for these outflows , for example , are incompatible with the simple 2d models of sweet - parker and petschek reconnection , which have alfvnic velocities for the outflows . 
 @xcite suggest that the interaction of the reconnected flux tubes with pre - existing magnetic fields provide a drag force that slows the downflows . 
 another difficulty in interpreting the downflows as evidence for magnetic reconnection is the formation of the initial flare plasma . for most events 
 the downflows that are easily observed occur late in the flare and descend into an existing cloud of hot emission . 
 the initial flare emission forms essentially `` in place , '' and not as a descending loop  although there is some evidence for collapsing motions after these loops appear . 
 finally , the reconnection of magnetic fields should lead to the release of energy that drives chromospheric evaporation . 
 all of the downflows that we detect here , however , are observed as depletions relative to the ambient high temperature emission into which they are descending . 
 recent work by @xcite suggests that density depletions can be formed in reconnecting flux tubes that move through a nonuniform current sheet . their model 
 , however , does not include chromospheric evaporation and it is not clear how long such density depletions would persist . 
 the inability of the simple , two - dimensional reconnection models to describe many details of the downflows suggests that three - dimensional modeling is required . 
 the aia observations we have shown here give ample evidence for inhomogeneity in the reconnecting magnetic fields and this inhomogeneity will be a component of any successful model . 
 high resolution observations of the photospheric magnetic field in active regions , such as those taken with the solar optical telescope ( sot ) on _ hinode _ ( e.g , * ? ? ? 
 * ) , show that the magnetic field is structured on the spatial scale of the granules ( @xmath01000 km ) and we conjecture that this inhomogeneity is reflected in the highly structured appearance of the flare plasma .","perhaps the most compelling evidence for the role of magnetic reconnection in solar flares comes from the supra - arcade downflows that have been observed above many post - flare loop arcades . 
 these downflows are thought to be related to highly non - potential field lines that have reconnected and are propagating away from the current sheet . 
 we present new observations of supra - arcade downflows taken with the atmospheric imagining assembly ( aia ) on the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( _ sdo _ ) . 
 the morphology and dynamics of the downflows observed with aia provide new evidence for the role of magnetic reconnection in solar flares . with these new observations we are able to measure downflows originating at much larger heights than in previous studies . 
 we find , however , that the initial velocities measured here ( @xmath0144 km  s@xmath1 ) are well below the alfvn speed expected in the lower corona , and consistent with previous results . 
 we also find no evidence that the downflows brighten with time , as would be expected from chromospheric evaporation .

 these observations suggest that simple two - dimensional models can not explain the detailed observations of solar flares .",in most models of solar flares the release of energy in the corona ultimately drives chromospheric evaporation and leads to the formation of hot dense loops e g many of the downflows however are observed as dark features and it is not clear that all of the high temperature emission in the flare is formed from descending loops. high resolution observations of the photospheric magnetic field in active regions such as those taken with the solar optical telescope sot on _ hinode _ e g show that the magnetic field is structured on the spatial scale of the granules km and we conjecture that this inhomogeneity is reflected in the highly structured appearance of the flare plasma. rrcrr 00 132 6 0 039 831 7 32 1 01 149 0 2 282 119 0 271 6 02 178 6 0 274 454 1 124 5 03 196 6 0 492 290 6 143 0 04 204 3 0 857 226 7 194 2 05 136 5 0 619 261 2 161 7 06 188 9 0 271 500 6 135 8 07 180 9 0 308 507 7 156 2 08 225 6 0 089 1031 3 91 7 09 250 4 0 044 1938 6 84 6 00 113 6 2 185 128 1 279 9 01 118 9 1 043 212 5 221 7 02 131 1 1 506 166 6 250 9 03 117 6 0 581 231 3 134 3 04 128 2 0 440 345 3 152 1 05 110 8 0 161 406 1 65 3 06 63 8 0 087 659 1 57 1 07 82 0 0 237 363 8 86 1 08 80 4 1 050 115 6 121 3 09 103 7 0 786 192 2 151 1 10 73 8 0 306 245 1 75 1 11 90 9 0 375 270 7 101 7 00 75 2 2 687 102 1 274 4 01 84 7 2 726 97 1 264 8 02 83 3 0 451 274 1 123 7 03 70 5 3 407 77 7 264 8 04 61 7 1 190 120 0 142 8 05 75 1 0 867 165 8 143 7 06 88 3 0 473 316 6 149 9 07 70 7 1 059 155 9 165 0 08 76 7 0 438 243 4 106 5 09 83 1 0 403 440 2 177 0 table inflows a useful way of tracking features as they descend is to create height time maps. the launch of the atmospheric imaging assembly aia on the _ solar dynamics observatory _ _ sdo _ provides a new opportunity to investigate the dynamics of newly reconnected flux tubes in solar flares. during the 20102012 time frame the spacecraft are approximately 90 xmath2 from the earth sun line which allows flares to be observed simultaneously as limb events by aia and disk events by the euvi imagers on _ stereo_ in this paper we report new observations of supra arcade downflows taken with aia and euvi. to characterize the kinematics of the downflows we fit selected height time tracks to a function of the form with this assumption the velocity of the downflow as a function of time is and the acceleration is this functional form for the height captures the rapid transition from a relatively high initial velocity of at a height of to a relatively slow terminal descent . perhaps the most compelling piece of indirect evidence is the supra arcade downflows that have been observed above many post flare loop arcades e g these downflows appear to be related to highly non potential field lines that have reconnected and are propagating away from the current sheet. magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in astrophysical plasmas and is believed to be responsible for a wide range of solar phenomena including solar flares for a review see unfortunately magnetic reconnection occurs on spatial scales that are too small to be resolved with current solar instrumentation and can not be observed directly. we have presented the first observations of supra arcade downflows with the aia instrument on _ sdo_ with the new capabilities of aia we are able to track inflows at much larger heights and for much smaller events than in previous observations. similar features are observed in the outer corona when the streamer belt is viewed face on e g despite the extensive analysis of previous observations a number of questions remain regarding the downflows and their relationship to magnetic reconnection,0.3035522066738428,0.17259978425026967,0.17007534983853606
91,"a laser interferometer to detect gravitational waves , such as the laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory(ligo ) , virgo , geo600 , or tama300 , will be in operation within several years@xcite . 
 it is one of the most urgent subjects for theoretical relativists to make a set of templates of gravitational waves . 
 the direct detection of gravitational waves is very important not only as a new  eye "" observing the universe ( gravitational wave astronomy ) but also as a new probe for fundamental physics . 
 for example , we know that a neutron star , which is observed as a pulsar , has a mass @xmath1 and a radius @xmath2 @xmath3 . 
 although we can guess its central region with some theoretical ansatz , we have no direct information from the inside of a neutron star because neither radiation nor a neutrino is transparent in the central region . 
 the direct detection of gravitational waves may provide some information about the inside of a neutron star when it is formed , resulting in new observational facts or constraints about the equation of state for high density matter . 
 one of the most promising astronomical sources for these ground - based detectors is a coalesced compact binary such as a neutron star binary . to complete a set of templates from such a source 
 , many studies about the emitted gravitational waves have been done using various techniques . 
 a numerical simulation without approximations ( numerical relativity ) is probably one of the best ways to calculate gravitational waves emitted from the compact binary system @xcite . 
 although steady progress in numerical relativity has been achieved , there are still some difficulties which prevent us from finding the final results .    instead , there are some powerful approximation methods to mimic the coalescence of a compact binary system . 
 one such approximation is the perturbative approach . 
 regge and wheeler @xcite and zerilli @xcite first formulated a method for metric perturbations in a schwarzschild black hole spacetime . 
 then there are many works using such a black hole perturbation method in which we describe gravitational waves by metric perturbations in a black hole background spacetime and treat a companion of the binary as a test particle@xcite . 
 this approximation for gravitational waves in a head - on collision of two black holes gives a good agreement with the results obtained by numerical simulation@xcite . 
 thus , such a perturbative approach may provide a good approximation for gravitational waves from a compact binary as well .    however , there are so far few works for neutron star perturbations 
 . one may think that if we have two @xmath4 neutron stars , it will be a black hole after coalescence , when the ringing tail of the gravitational waves can be described by quasinormal modes of the black hole . 
 the quasinormal modes of a neutron star may have nothing to do with the final stage of the coalescence . 
 however , before black hole formation , we have to analyze the orbital evolution of the neutron star binary . 
 therefore , we believe that a perturbation analysis for a neutron star is also important .    for a nonradial pulsation of a spherically symmetric relativistic star , perturbation equations both for axial and polar modes were first derived by thorne and campolattaro @xcite . 
 similar to the black hole perturbation , the axial mode for a spherical star is described by a second order differential equation . 
 on the other hand , the polar mode was first described by a fifth order differential equation@xcite . however , because of the dynamical degrees of freedom of polar modes , i.e. , sound waves and gravitational waves , the basic equation can be reduced to a fourth order differential equation as shown by lindblom and detweiler @xcite . 
 lindblom , mendell , and ipser @xcite also derived a couple of second order differential equations , which could be interpreted as those for sound waves and gravitational waves , respectively . 
 as in the case of black hole perturbations , quasinormal modes , if they exist , will be important in the analysis of gravitational waves from a compact binary . for the polar mode 
 , there are two types of quasinormal modes of a neutron star ; one is a fluid oscillation mode similar to the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 modes of a newtonian star ( cf . 
 @xcite ) ; the other is a wave mode ( @xmath8 mode ) , which exists only in general relativity @xcite . even for the axial mode , 
 chandrasekhar and ferrari@xcite illustrated that quasinormal modes exist if the effective potential has a minimal as that in an ultracompact star . 
 kokkotas @xcite numerically calculated such axial quasinormal modes for various ultracompact stars . 
 kojima @xcite extended it to a slowly rotating star , setting regge - wheeler gauge conditions . 
 as for emitted gravitational waves from a binary system , kojima @xcite studied them for the case that a test particle is moving in a circular orbit around a polytropic star . for a circular orbit , 
 the axial mode cancels from the orbital symmetry so that the polar mode was only taken into account . 
 he showed that the resonance mode appears in the energy flux when the orbit reaches the radius where the orbital frequency coincides with that of the quasinormal mode . 
 for the axial mode , recently , borrelli @xcite calculated energy spectra of gravitational waves emitted by a test particle spiraling into an ultracompact star . in his result , 
 its energy spectrum shows many peaks , which correspond to axial quasinormal modes of the star . 
 although it is important , since we are interested in a compact binary , a direct collision might show some different features from the binary case . 
 we also do not know what will happen when a test particle reaches the surface of the star . 
 to avoid such an unknown factor and to analyze the case of a compact binary , we first study gravitational waves emitted when a test particle is scattered by a neutron star in this paper .    for a schwarzschild black hole , oohara and 
 nakamura @xcite analyzed it and showed that the energy spectrum has no peak except for one which corresponds to the orbital frequency . 
 here we consider a spherical star instead of a schwarzschild black hole . 
 we study only the axial mode which does not exist in newton gravity . to discuss the dependence of the equations of state , we analyze two models : a uniform density star as in @xcite and a polytropic star . 
 this paper is organized as follows . in secs . 
 [ sec : linear]a and [ sec : linear]b , we briefly review the perturbation theory for a spherically symmetric relativistic star . 
 we show our numerical results in sec . 
 [ sec : gw ] . 
 section [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to a discussion . 
 some numerical techniques for calculating gravitational waves are summarized in the appendix . throughout this paper 
 , we use units of @xmath9 and a metric signature of @xmath10 . 
 we start with summarizing briefly the metric perturbation of a spherically symmetric relativistic star . a spherically symmetric background metric @xmath11 is described as @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a mass function inside a radius @xmath15 . 
 we assume a perfect fluid as the stellar matter , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the total energy density and the pressure , respectively , which satisfy a barotropic equation of state , @xmath19 . 
 using tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations , we construct a stellar model and its spacetime metric numerically except for the constant density star case . 
 the radius @xmath20 of a star is defined by a surface where the pressure vanishes , and the mass of the star @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 .    for linearized einstein equations 
 , we can decompose the perturbed metric into an axial mode @xmath23 and a polar mode @xmath24 : @xmath25    using regge - wheeler gauge conditions , we will integrate the interior and exterior regions of the linearized einstein equations , separately , and impose appropriate junction conditions at the surface @xmath20 to find the solution . in this paper 
 , we only deal with axial mode perturbation . 
 then , we write down the linearized einstein equation only for axial modes in the following subsections .      in order to find the linearized einstein equations for axial modes , we expand the perturbed metric by tensor harmonics for polar angle @xmath26 and azimuthal angle @xmath27 @xcite , and proceed to a fourier transformation for the time coordinate @xmath28 . 
 although there are ten independent components for the linearized metric , four of them are gauge freedoms of coordinate transformations , which are fixed by a choice of regge - wheeler gauge @xcite , resulting in two components belonging to axial modes , while the rest of the four correspond to polar modes . for axial mode perturbations , we can set @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath15 defined below , and @xmath32 is a spherical harmonics . 
 the axial mode in the interior region of a star is described by a single wave equation for gravitational waves , because a rotation does not exist in a spherically symmetric background spacetime . 
 that is , we have a single wave function @xmath33 , which determines the behaviors of axial modes as @xmath34 the equation for the wave function @xmath33 is derived from the linearized einstein equation for axial modes as @xmath35 where the `` tortoise '' coordinate @xmath36 and the effective potential @xmath37 are defined as @xmath38 respectively . 
 as for the boundary condition , the wave function @xmath33 must be regular at the center of a star . 
 expanding @xmath33 around the center @xmath39 , we find @xmath40 r^{l + 3 } + o(r^{l+5 } ) \right\ } , \label{eq : bc_x}\ ] ] where @xmath41 is an arbitrary constant , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are the central density , pressure , and metric functions , respectively . 
 apart from a free parameter @xmath41 , we obtain a solution @xmath33 by integrating eq . 
 ( [ eq : inside_perturbation_equation ] ) with the boundary condition ( @xmath45 ) . 
 further details of the numerical techniques constructing the wave function @xmath33 are given in the appendix , subsection [ subsec : app_interior ] . 
 the background metric outside the star is the schwarzschild spacetime , i.e. , eq . 
 ( [ eq : bgmetric ] ) , with @xmath46 as for the trajectory of a test particle , without loss of generality , we can assume that the particle moves on the equatorial plane ( @xmath47 ) . 
 then , the equation of motion for the particle is described as @xmath48 where the particle trajectory is @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the mass , the normalized energy , and the normalized orbital angular momentum of the particle , respectively , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 . 
 the normalized effective potential energy @xmath55 of the particle is given as @xmath56 in this paper , since we only consider the motion of a test particle scattered by a spherical star , the particle orbit is unbounded , i.e. , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the maximum value of the potential . 
 the perturbed metric outside a star only comes from an oscillation of spacetime , that is , gravitational waves . 
 then , similar to the interior region , the linearized einstein equations for the metric @xmath59 and @xmath60 defined as eq . 
 ( [ metric ] ) are reduced to a single wave equation for a new wave function @xmath61 defined by @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is one of the source terms given below .    from the linearized vacuum einstein equations 
 , we find the wave equation for @xmath61 ( regge - wheeler equation)@xcite as @xmath65 where @xmath36 is the tortoise coordinate defined by @xmath66 @xmath67 is regge - wheeler potential given by @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the source term , which is described by the energy - momentum tensor of a test particle expanded by tensor harmonics@xcite as @xmath70 \right ] , \label{source}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath71 and @xmath72 being @xmath73 ,   \label{eq : def_q } \\

 the details of constructing the wave function @xmath61 are given in the appendix , subsections [ subsec : app_exterior ] and [ subsec : app_turning_point ] . 
 we have to combine two wave functions , the interior wave function @xmath33 and the exterior one @xmath61 , at the surface of the star . 
 the matching condition is that the wave function must be continuous and smooth at the surface . for the case of the axial mode , 
 since the wave function inside the star does not couple to perturbations of the matter fluid , the condition turns out to be very simple as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the radius of the star by use of the  tortoise "" coordinate . 
 then we calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves @xmath78 as follows : we first integrate eqs . 
 ( [ eq : inside_perturbation_equation ] ) and ( [ eq : outside_perturbation_equation ] ) using their boundary conditions , eqs . 
 ( [ eq : bc_x ] ) and ( [ eq : bc_infty ] ) . 
 next , we connect those solutions at the surface of the star using eqs . 
 ( [ eq : s_condition1 ] ) and ( [ eq : s_condition2 ] ) , which determine two unknown coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath78 .    from the wave function 
 obtained as above , we obtain some information about gravitational waves emitted by a scattered particle . 
 when we discuss the gravitational waves , we usually decompose them into two modes : @xmath81 and @xmath82 modes . 
 then , we have to transform our coordinate system from the regge - wheeler gauge to the transverse - traceless one , which metric near infinity is described as @xmath83 then the axial mode in transverse - traceless gauge at infinity turns out to be @xmath84 where the spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xmath85 is defined by @xmath86 the energy - momentum tensor of the gravitational waves at infinity is given by @xmath87 in the transverse - traceless gauge , where the angular brackets denote an appropriate average .    from this definition , 
 we find the energy spectrum @xmath88 of gravitational waves at infinity for the axial mode as @xmath89 
 in this subsection , we consider a uniform density star . we restrict our analysis only to the case of the @xmath90 mode , just for simplicity . 
 we find that features of the energy spectrum of emitted gravitational waves can be classified into two cases , which mainly depend on the shape of the effective potential . 
 figure [ fig : potential ] shows the effective potential [ eqs . 
 ( [ eq : inside_perturbation_equation_potential ] ) and ( [ eq : outside_perturbation_equation_potential ] ) ] for a uniform density star with three different compactness parameters @xmath91 . 
 the effective potential has the following three features . 
 first , the regge - wheeler potential [ eq . 
 ( [ eq : outside_perturbation_equation_potential ] ) ] has a maximum point near @xmath92 ( accurately at @xmath93 for @xmath94 ) . 
 second , the potential is discontinuous at the surface because of a discontinuity of the energy density of the star at the surface . 
 finally , a potential minimum appears inside the star , if the star is ultracompact ( for the case of @xmath0 ) .    according to the last feature 
 , we study two cases separately . 
 the first stellar type is the case that the surface is outside the potential barrier ( @xmath95 ) . for a usual neutron star , @xmath96 , and 
 then the first type is most likely a realistic astronomical object . 
 the second stellar type is the case that the surface is inside the potential barrier ( @xmath97 ) , which may be an exotic star , if it exists . 
 first we show our result for the first type . for the case of @xmath98 
 , we show the energy spectra of emitted gravitational waves in fig . 
 [ fig : rm5 ] . in this figure 
 , there exists only a single peak in each spectrum . 
 this peak corresponds to the orbital frequency of a test particle at the turning point , i.e. , periastron . 
 this means that most gravitational waves are emitted around the turning point , where the effect of the gravitational field is the strongest . 
 no other feature is found in this spectrum . 
 in fact , fixing the energy @xmath99 and orbital angular momentum @xmath100 , the spectrum depends less on the compactness parameter @xmath91 ( see fig . [ 
 fig : rm5bh ] ) . for a black hole background 
 , we find quite similar behaviors in the energy spectrum ( fig . 
 [ fig : rm5bh ] ) , except for the high frequency region , where the difference of the boundary conditions is crucial . 
 we also find that the spectrum approaches closer to that of a black hole as the star gets smaller . 
 we also calculate the waveform for the case of @xmath101 and black holes , respectively . 
 we see that a burst wave due to the encounter of a test particle emerges for each case . as the same as the energy spectrum , the difference between these waveform is very little ( see fig . 
 [ fig : wf5 ] )    therefore , for the first stellar type of @xmath102 , the energy spectrum largely depends on the trajectory , but not on the background object . 
 next we discuss an ultracompact star , which shows much more various structure in the spectrum . in this case 
 , a minimum point of the effective potential appears inside the star . as for the trajectory of a test particle , we have two possibilities : one is that the particle gets into the inside region beyond the potential barrier and the other is that one passes through outside the barrier . since the particle approaches closer to the star , it feels a stronger gravitational field . as a result , 
 the excitation by the particle is more efficient and the emitted gravitational waves are enhanced . as a numerical example , we show those energy spectra for the model with radius @xmath103 with the turning points @xmath104 and @xmath105 in fig . [ 
 fig : rm2.26 ] .    apart from a global maximum , which appears in the first type model as well and corresponds to the orbital frequency of a test particle at the turning point 
 , we also find many small periodic peaks in fig . 
 [ fig : rm2.26 ] . 
 this microscopic peak structure is classified into two types , which are divided at the frequency of the maximum @xmath106 ( @xmath107 for @xmath94 ) of the effective potential . in the lower frequency region ( @xmath108 ) 
 , small and sharp peaks correspond to the quasinormal modes , as we will show it next . for the higher frequency region ( @xmath109 ) , we find small periodic peaks , which may appear because of a resonance between two potential barriers . 
 we will also discuss this later .    in order to analyze our numerical results 
 , we first have to know the axial quasinormal modes . our method to calculate a quasinormal mode 
 is based on the continued fraction expansion method which was originally used for black holes by leaver @xcite , and adopted for the polar mode of a spherical star by leins , nollert , and soffel @xcite . 
 we apply this method to axial modes as well . 
 we show our results in table [ tab : qnm_urm2.26 ] with those of kokkotas@xcite whose method is different from ours . 
 the table shows that both results agree quite well .    in fig . 
 [ fig : rm2.26qnm ] , we present both the quasinormal mode and energy spectrum . as seen from fig . 
 [ fig : rm2.26qnm ] , axial 
 quasinormal "" modes are classified into two : the lower frequency mode ( @xmath110 ) , which imaginary part is very small @xmath111 , and the higher frequency mode ( @xmath112 ) , which imaginary part is rather large @xmath113 . 
 the reason is very simple . for a frequency lower than @xmath114 
 , we can have a quasibound state . 
 since trapped waves tunnel through the potential barrier , the energy will decrease . 
 it is similar to the quasinormal mode of a black hole . 
 then , we may call it the axial quasinormal mode as well . however , if the frequency is higher than @xmath114 , we have no bound state . 
 nevertheless , we can find the 
 quasinormal "" mode , by which we mean a wave solution with the same boundary condition as that of the conventional quasinormal mode , which is the outgoing wave condition . in the present case , although we find such wave solutions , those waves decay very quickly because the frequency is higher than the potential barrier . 
 this is the reason why we find a large imaginary part of the mode frequency . 
 the solutions which satisfy the boundary condition appear periodically as seen from fig . 
 [ fig : rm2.26qnm ] . 
 we find that the frequencies of these quasinormal modes coincide with those of spectrum peaks in the frequency region lower than @xmath114 . 
 this is because a test particle excites those quasinormal modes . 
 in fact , when we see the waveform ( fig . [ 
 fig : wf2.26 ] ) , the wave consists of two parts : large one , which corresponds to the burst wave by the encounter by a test particle , and the other part with several oscillations , which comes from exited quasinormal modes in the spectrum . 
 actually the waveform in the region after @xmath115 in fig . 
 [ fig : wf2.26 ] is similar to kokkotas s result for a gaussian pulse wave @xcite .    on the other hand , in a frequency region 
 higher than @xmath114 , although many periodic peaks appear , those positions are not exactly the same as the frequencies of  quasinormal "" modes . 
 we may understand this fact as follows . 
 even if the wave frequency @xmath116 is higher than the potential barrier , the reflection coefficient does not vanish and oscillates with respect to @xmath116 , which period is determined by the potential form . in the present case , we have also an infinite wall near the center of a star . 
 we then expect that small periodic peaks appearing in the spectrum are due to an interference between the incoming and outgoing waves reflected by two potential barriers . 
 since these waves decay very quickly as mentioned above , the process is quite dynamical , and then the peaks in the spectrum do not coincide with the frequencies of  quasinormal "" modes .    in fig . 
 [ fig : rm2.26 - 2.3 ] , we show the energy spectra for two stellar models with @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , which correspond to the cases that the turning point is inside and outside the barrier , respectively . for fixed energy @xmath119 and angular momentum @xmath100 
 , the global peaks corresponding to the orbital frequency at the turning point agree with each other . on the other hand , the other small periodic peaks from the excited quasinormal modes do not agree with and rather depend on the compactness parameter @xmath91 . consequently , from the analysis of the energy spectrum of axial modes , we may determine the compactness parameter @xmath91 of an ultracompact star . 
 we can also compare a black hole and an ultracompact star . in fig . 
 [ fig : rm2.26bh ] , we show the energy spectra both for a black hole @xcite and an ultracompact star with @xmath120 . from fig . 
 [ fig : rm2.26bh ] , we see that even for the case of a schwarzschild black hole , the global peak due to the orbital motion of the particle coincides with that for the star . however , unlike the stellar model , 
 no small periodic peaks appear in the case of a black hole . 
 in fact for a black hole , there is no peak after @xmath115 ( see fig . 
 this is because the effective potential of the star has an infinite potential wall near the center , which guarantees the existence of quasinormal modes , while that of a schwarzschild black hole has no such wall , and incoming waves fall entirely into the event horizon @xmath121 . 
 hence , we can also distinguish a background object , i.e. , whether it is an ultracompact star or a black hole , analyzing only axial modes . 
 as for the total energy of emitted gravitational waves @xmath122 , we find @xmath123 with @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively , and for @xmath128 and @xmath129 . 
 the efficiency @xmath130 increases monotonically as the compactness gets smaller , and seems to end up with that for schwarzschild black holes ( @xmath131 ) . for @xmath132 and @xmath133 , the efficiency , which is @xmath134 , 
 little depends on @xmath135 up to the case of a black hole .      from the analysis of the energy spectrum for a uniform density star , we find that the spectrum strongly depends on the shape of effective potential . therefore , 
 it may be important to see the dependence of the equation of state on the energy spectrum . then , in this section , we study a polytropic star . just for simplicity 
 , we use the newtonian polytropic equation of state as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is a polytropic index and @xmath138 is a constant value .    first , we consider the first type stellar model with @xmath139 . 
 we set the polytropic index @xmath140 and the constant @xmath141 , and choose the central energy density @xmath142 . 
 this choice gives a stellar model with mass @xmath143 and radius @xmath144 . 
 the compact parameter is @xmath145 , and then the surface locates outside the peak of the regge - wheeler potential . 
 we show the energy spectra of gravitational waves from a scattering test particle in fig . 
 [ fig : polytropic1.0 ] . 
 we find the same feature as that for the uniform density star with @xmath146 , i.e. , there is only a single global peak which frequency corresponds to the orbital one of the particle at the turning point . 
 next , we discuss the second type stellar model , i.e. , an ultracompact star . to construct an ultracompact star with a polytropic equation of state 
 , we set the polytropic index @xmath147 , the constant @xmath148 , and choose the central energy density @xmath149 , for which the compactness parameter @xmath135 turns out to be the smallest . 
 for such a choice , the radius , mass , and compactness parameters of the star are @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 , respectively . 
 although this seems very implausible for a realistic star , we will use this solution in our analysis to study the dependence of the equation of state on the energy spectrum . in fig . 
 [ fig : polytropic0.5 ] , we show the energy spectra for two trajectories of a test particle . 
 one is the case that a particle goes into the inside of the potential barrier , while the other is the case that a particle passes through only outside the potential barrier . 
 we find the same feature as that of the uniform density star with @xmath153 . 
 the difference is found in the frequencies of quasinormal modes because of the different shapes of the potential . 
 then , we find many small and sharp peaks in the spectrum at the positions different from those for a uniform density star . 
 consequently , we may be able to distinguish the inside structure of an ultracompact star by observing the energy spectrum of emitted gravitational waves . 
 we have studied the axial modes of gravitational waves from a test particle scattered by a spherically symmetric relativistic star . 
 we have considered both a uniform density star and a polytropic star . 
 we find that the energy spectrum depends mainly on the shape of the effective potential for gravitational waves , i.e. , whether its minimum exists or not . 
 when there is no minimum ( e.g. , a regular type of neutron star with a compactness parameter @xmath154 ) , the energy spectrum shows only a single global peak , which corresponds to the orbital frequency of a test particle at the turning point . 
 gravitational waves are mostly emitted around the turning point , where the effect of the gravitational field is strongest .    while if a minimum of the effective potential exists ( i.e. , some exotic relativistic star with small compactness parameter @xmath155 ) , the energy spectrum shows a variety in its structure in addition to the global peak as the same as that found in the previous case . 
 we find small and sharp periodic peaks in the region lower than @xmath114 ( the maximum value of the effective potential ) , which correspond to an excitation of the axial quasinormal modes . 
 the existence of the potential minimum allows the existence of a quasibound state of gravitational waves , i.e. , quasinormal modes . 
 then those modes are excited by a scattered particle . 
 this becomes more conspicuous when the particle gets into the inside region beyond the potential barrier . 
 we also find small periodic peaks in the frequency region beyond @xmath114 , which may come from an interference between two waves reflected by the potential barrier and the infinite wall near the center of the star .    from the observation of the energy spectrum of the axial mode , 
 what we can determine ? naively speaking , we may not find any information about the constituent of the star , because the axial mode does not couple to matter fluid . 
 this is true for the first type stellar model , i.e. , a regular neutron star . emitted gravitational waves 
 are mostly determined by the particle orbit . 
 the case of black holes also belongs to this case , although there is a small difference in the high frequency part because of the difference of the boundary condition . 
 however , if a star is compact enough to make a potential minimum ( @xmath156 ) , emitted gravitational waves show much more abundant information . 
 it may determine a compactness parameter @xmath91 . 
 we also find quasinormal mode frequencies , which depend on the shape of the potential , and then could depend on the equation of state .    in the axial mode case , however , in general , we can not have direct information about the matter fluid , in particular about the equation of state . 
 the polar mode of gravitational waves will provide us a more conspicuous dependence of matter property . 
 work on the polar modes is under way . 
 we would like to thank yasufumi kojima for kind suggestions at the beginning of this study . 
 the numerical computations were mainly performed by the fujitsu - vx vector computer at the media network center , waseda university . 
 this work was supported partially by a jsps grant - in - aid ( no . 5689 and specially promoted research no .

 here , we present numerical techniques solving the wave equations . 
 we improved borrelli s method@xcite to guarantee numerical accuracy . 
 for the interior region , the numerical error of the wave function accumulates and becomes maximal at the surface , because the pressure vanishes there . in order to overcome this difficulty , we solve the wave equation both from the center and from the surface , and connect two wave functions at some inner point , e.g. , 
 @xmath157 . for the exterior solution 
 , we integrate the wave equation from the surface to infinity , by which we can reduce the numerical error . in the present model , 
 the test particle mainly emits gravitational waves at the turning point , where we have to solve the wave equation very carefully because an apparent divergence appears . 
 we shall discuss these three methods in order . 
 here we show how to solve the interior wave equation ( [ eq : inside_perturbation_equation ] ) . transforming the wave function @xmath33 to @xmath158 
 we find the perturbation equation for @xmath159 as @xmath160 \frac{dz_{l\omega}}{dr } + e^{\lambda - \nu } \left ( \omega^2 -\frac{2n}{r^2}e^{\nu }   \right )   z_{l\omega } = 0 . 
 \label{eq : near_center_z_equation}\end{aligned}\ ] ] from the regularity condition at the center , we obtain the asymptotic behavior at @xmath161 as @xmath162 r^{l + 4 } + o(r^{l+6 } ) \right\ } , \label{eq : near_center_z}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are density , pressure , and metric functions evaluated at the center , respectively . 
 in order to reduce the numerical error at the surface , we adopt the following procedure .      then , we find two independent wave functions @xmath165 by integrating eq . 
 ( [ eq : near_center_z_equation ] ) from the surface to the middle point . 
 the boundary conditions of those wave functions at the surface are given as @xmath166 , @xmath167 . 
 by those two independent solutions , we construct the wave function @xmath168 as @xmath169 where the coefficients @xmath170 and @xmath171 are fixed by junction conditions at @xmath157 . 
 since the wave functions constructed above must be continuous and smooth at @xmath157 , we find the junction conditions @xmath172 from these two conditions , we find @xmath170 and @xmath171 , and then the interior wave function @xmath159 . 
 next we construct the exterior wave function . in order to use the green s function method 
 , we first consider the homogeneous wave function @xmath176 , which satisfies the wave equation @xmath177 and the boundary condition at the surface , which we have already evaluated in the previous subsection , that is , @xmath178 then , we construct a particular solution @xmath179 with a source term , which equation is described as @xmath180 where @xmath69 comes from the motion of a test particle . at the surface , 
 the solution @xmath179 satisfies the following condition : @xmath181 for the homogeneous equation ( [ eq : outside_perturbation_eq_homogeneout ] ) , we have two independent solutions @xmath182 and @xmath183 , which correspond to outgoing and incoming waves at infinity , respectively . 
 then , we describe the wave function @xmath176 by these two independent solutions as @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath186 are complex constants , which are fixed by eqs . 
 ( [ boundary1 ] ) , ( [ boundary2 ] ) .    the green s function @xmath187 for eq . ( [ eq : outside_perturbation_eq_inhomogeneout ] ) is also constructed by @xmath188 and @xmath189 as @xmath190 \theta(r^ { * } - s^ { * } ) \qquad ( r^ { * } > s^{*}),\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath191 is the wronskian and @xmath192 is the heaviside function . the wave function @xmath193 is obtained by integration as @xmath194 then , the solution for the exterior wave equation ( [ eq : outside_perturbation_equation ] ) with the same boundary conditions as eqs . 
 ( [ boundary1 ] ) , ( [ boundary2 ] ) is given as @xmath195    the asymptotic behavior of @xmath196 as @xmath197 is given by @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200 are defined by @xmath201 since there is no incoming wave , we find the boundary condition such that @xmath202 then , the amplitude @xmath78 of gravitational waves at infinity is given by @xmath203 in order to extract the amplitude @xmath78 from our solution , we use the relation @xmath204 s_{lm\omega}^{\rm ( ext ) } ( s^ { * } ) ds^ { * }   \nonumber \\ & = & \frac{1}{w } \int_{r^{*}}^{\infty } x_{lm\omega}^{\rm ( ext)(0)}(s^ { * } )   s_{lm\omega}^{\rm ( ext ) } ( s^ { * } ) ds^{*}. \label{eq : boundary_condition_infinity2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with eqs . 
 ( [ eq : boundary_condition_infinity ] ) and ( [ eq : boundary_condition_infinity2 ] ) , we finally obtain the amplitude as @xmath205 where @xmath186 is already obtained up to an unknown constant @xmath206 , which is canceled out with that of @xmath176 in eq . 
 ( [ eq : amplitude_result ] )      when a test particle is scattered by a star , the orbit includes a turning point ( @xmath207 or @xmath208 by the tortoise coordinate ) , where the radial velocity @xmath209 vanishes . 
 the source term @xmath69 in eq . 
 ( [ eq : amplitude_result ] ) is given by eq . 
 ( [ source ] ) , where @xmath210 and @xmath211 , defined by eqs . 
 ( [ eq : def_q ] ) and ( [ eq : def_d ] ) , for the present orbit ( @xmath212 ) are described as @xmath213 where @xmath214 which is a normalization constant of a spherical harmonics @xmath215 , and @xmath216 is the associated legendre function . 
 integration over the proper time @xmath217 gives the term of @xmath218 in eq . 
 ( [ d_lm ] ) , which diverges at the turning point , and then the integration @xmath219 diverges apparently 
 . however , this is not a physical divergence , but rather comes from the change of integration variables from the proper time @xmath217 to the radius @xmath15 . 
 this transformation becomes singular at the turning point because @xmath220 . in order to avoid this difficulty , 
 we shall use a time coordinate @xmath221 in the integration . 
 since the trajectory before and after the turning point is symmetric , we choose the initial position of the particle @xmath222 , @xmath223 at the turning point and integrate from there to infinity . 
 the integral , eq . 
 ( [ integration ] ) , is then written as @xmath224 \nonumber   \\ & & \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad   + \hat{r } \left ( 1 - \frac{2m}{\hat{r } } \right ) \frac{1}{d \hat{r}/ d \hat{t } }   \frac{d x_{lm\omega}^{\rm ( ext)(0)}}{d \hat{t } } s_{lm}^{(1 ) } ( \hat{t } ) \biggr ] ,   \label{eq : source_term_integral_t } \\ & & \qquad \hat{s}_{lm}^{(0 ) } = \frac{8 \pi}{\tilde{e } } \biggl [ \sqrt{\frac{2}{l(l + 1 ) } } \left ( 1- \frac{2m}{\hat{r } } \right)^2   \hat{q}_{lm } \nonumber   \\ & & \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad   + \sqrt{\frac{2}{l(l + 1)(l - 1)(l + 2 ) } } \frac{2m}{\hat{r } } \left ( 1 - \frac{2m}{\hat{r } } \right ) \hat{d}_{lm } \biggr ] ,   \\ & & \qquad \hat{s}_{lm}^{(1 ) } = -\frac{8 \pi}{\tilde{e } }   \sqrt{\frac{2}{l(l + 1)(l - 1)(l + 2 ) } }   \left ( 1 - \frac{2m}{\hat{r } } \right ) \hat{d}_{lm } ,   \\ & & \qquad \hat{q}_{lm } = - 2 i c_{lm } \sqrt{\frac{2}{l(l + 1 ) } }   \frac{\mu \tilde{l}}{\hat{r}^3 ( 1 - 2m/\hat{r } ) } \gamma^{1/2 }   \frac{d p_{lm}}{d \hat{\theta } } \left({\pi\over 2}\right )   \sin ( \omega \hat{t } - m \hat{\phi } ) ,   \\ & & \qquad \hat{d}_{lm } =    \frac{- 4imc_{lm}}{\sqrt{2l(l + 1)(l - 1)(l + 2 ) } } \frac{\mu \tilde{l}^2}{\hat{r}^4 }    \frac{d p_{lm}}{d \hat{\theta}}\left({\pi\over 2}\right )   \cos ( \omega \hat{t } - m \hat{\phi}),\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath225 and @xmath226 is its time derivative . 
 however , the term in eq . 
 ( [ eq : source_term_integral_t ] ) , @xmath227 is still apparently divergent because @xmath228 vanishes at the turning point .    to avoid this difficulty , we expand @xmath176 , @xmath229 near the turning point . from the equation of motion , we find @xmath230 which is integrated as @xmath231 where @xmath232 is an integration constant . 
 then , we find the wave function near the turning point as @xmath233 where @xmath176 , @xmath234 , and @xmath235 at the turning point @xmath208 are found easily by integration of eq . 
 ( [ eq : outside_perturbation_eq_homogeneout ] ) . 
 since those functions are regular at the turning point , we can evaluate eq . 
 ( [ eq : source_term_integral_t ] ) without any difficulty .

 quasinormal "" modes for a uniform density star with @xmath236 . 
 we use the continued fraction expansion method , which was first used to calculate black hole quasinormal modes by leaver [ 24 ] , and @xmath8 modes of a polytropic star by leins , nollert , and soffel [ 16 ] . 
 our results agree quite well with those of kokkotas , who adopted a different method [ 20 ] . 
 our imaginary part has opposite sign to kokkotas s result , because our definition of the fourier transformation is opposite to his . [

92,"in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the topic of consensus decision making in several fields including animal behaviour @xcite , social sciences @xcite and control theory @xcite . in this paper 
 we use the paradigm of animal groups but we would like to stress already at this point that there is a considerable analogy between the decision - making processes in very different systems and we expect that our simple model should be applicable to a wider range of systems . our object of study is the phenomenon during which the animals moving in groups , seemingly make unanimous decisions on the choice and time of performing activities even in the absence of global leaders . it is expected that because of the heterogeneity in the attributes like the age , sex and social status of the animals in a group or the differences in their perception of external stimuli there will be differences in the motivations of the members at the time of making choices . however , in spite of the differences , synchronization is seen to take place . 
 examples include takeoff of swarm of honeybees from nest sites @xcite , activity synchronization in sheep @xcite , collective movement in monkeys @xcite , group departures of domestic geese @xcite and departure of ants from a feeding site @xcite . 
 the study of collective opinion formation in physics has mainly focused on human societies @xcite . 
 parallels have been drawn between phase transitions in magnets and the opinion dynamics in populations . 
 alternatively , the subject of collective motion of animal groups has been extensively modelled @xcite . here 
 point - like particles , representing animals , move with constant speed , each tending to align with its immediate neighbours , for low noise levels , giving rise to a globally ordered state replicating the motion of flocks where all animals move in the same direction .    in this report 
 we model the process of landing of bird flocks performing foraging flights as a typical example of collective decision making . 
 we view this phenomena as a shift of the average opinion of the flock from that of continuing horizontal flight about some preferred altitude to that of descent towards the surface below . 
 we model the fact that birds land almost synchronously even in the presence of heterogeneity in motivations , along the lines of the random field ising model ( rfim ) @xcite . 
 our approach is similar to that used in @xcite where the authors analyze ( among other cases ) the manner in which people in concert halls , initially joining the applause , stop clapping almost at the same time . in a very recent model @xcite for collective landing , 
 birds are assumed to move under the action of different _ social _ forces . 
 in addition , the internal state of each bird is characterized by a continuous variable called _ landing intent _ such that the internal state of each bird is directly coupled to the internal state of its neighbours . 
 in contrast we allow motivation of individual birds to be influenced by only the observable variables of their neighbours , like position and velocity . 
 in addition as a part of the model we introduce a method which enables us to work in open boundary conditions where the birds in flight move cohesively and do not spread out in the horizontal plane even in the presence of perturbations . with this model 
 we investigate the level of synchronicity in collective landing across time and space and explore the nature of fluctuations close to the point in time when landing occurs . 
 below we describe the two aspects of the model , _ viz . _ collective decision making and collective motion in detail . 
 the birds in our model are represented by particles characterized by the dynamical variables of position @xmath0 and velocity @xmath1 in three dimensional space . 
 the only _ natural _ boundary that we allow in the system is the @xmath2 plane which we consider to be the landing surface . 
 the @xmath3-coordinate of a flying bird gives its height above the ground . 
 we assign to each particle @xmath4 a variable @xmath5 such that we refer to a bird in the flying state as active ( @xmath6 ) and a bird in the landed state as inactive ( @xmath7 ) . 
 this variable is updated at discrete times @xmath8 according to the condition : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the time increment . once a bird @xmath4 
 has landed we keep its position unchanged till the end of the simulation . 
 also , from here on we use the words `` bird '' and `` particle '' synonymously . 
 first we focus on the variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 governing the cruising motion of the birds parallel to the landing surface . 
 this motion is assumed to be essentially decoupled from the motion in the vertical direction and is modelled in the spirit of @xcite . 
 a particle @xmath4 is assumed to move , with some uncertainty , in the average direction of motion of all neighboring particles @xmath13 whose separation @xmath14 from @xmath4 is less than a interaction radius @xmath15 . from now on we refer to the set of particles in this neighbourhood as @xmath16 with respect to a particle @xmath4 such that , the inactive particles and the particle @xmath4 are included as well . 
 the expression for updating velocity at a time @xmath8 is given by @xmath17,\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the magnitude of the velocity , @xmath19 is the rotation matrix in two dimensions representing a random perturbation by an angle @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the unit vector @xmath22 . here 
 @xmath20 is chosen with a uniform probability from the interval @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 is the amplitude of the noise . 
 we describe the force - like term @xmath25 below . 
 we follow the standard version @xcite of the original spp model @xcite for the updating of positions : @xmath26    we mention here that it is a well - known problem with existing models of collective motion to maintain the cohesiveness of a moving flock in the presence of a finite amount of noise @xmath24 and with finite ranged ( as @xmath15 ) interaction between the members . 
 a flock tends to break up into smaller sub - flocks which eventually move in independent directions . 
 a periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) is used to prevent the flock from spreading out perpendicular to the direction of motion . however , in the problem of landing we find that the imposition of a pbc would be unrealistic in the sense that there will be a possibility of a particle that has become inactive and hence ceased to move , to continually exchange information with the rest of the moving flock . 
 therefore , we introduce a new kind of `` comoving boundary '' condition where we imagine the motion of the particles on the @xmath27-plane to be governed by a circular bounding region with radius @xmath28 and the centre lying on the centre of mass ( _ com _ ) of all active particles ( mass of each assumed to be unity ) . 
 this boundary therefore translates with the flock as the _ com _ is put into motion due to collective motion of the particles . 
 when a particle which is inside the region tries to leave it , the particle is subjected to an attraction proportional to the distance from the boundary . 
 the direction of this attraction is along the resultant of the direction towards the location of the _ com _ and the direction of motion of the _ com _ itself . for a particle located at @xmath29 at an instant of time , the attraction @xmath30 is given by : @xmath31\mathbf{c}\big(\mathbf{x^{\shortparallel}}\big )          & \mbox { if $ |\mathbf{x}^{\shortparallel}-\mathbf{\overline{x}}^{\shortparallel}| > r_\mathrm{b}$ } \\        0 & \mbox { otherwise , }      \end{array } \right.\ ] ] with @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the strength of the attraction , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the position and the velocity of the _ com _ , respectively , parallel to the @xmath27-plane at that instant and @xmath36 is a parameter . the _ com _ and its velocity 
 are calculated with respect to the active particles . in the figure [ field ] we plot 
 @xmath25 when the motion of the _ com _ is in a direction parallel to the y - axis . 
 similarly , we assume that the boundary adjusts itself to keep average separation between active particles constant . 
 thus , in general @xmath28 is a function of time , given by , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fraction of the active particles at time @xmath8 and @xmath39 is the number of particles , initially active , per unit area of the @xmath27-plane .     on the @xmath27-plane , defined through ( [ bound-1 ] ) for the value of @xmath40 . 
 the direction of motion of the _ com _ is assumed to be along the y - axis , indicated by the arrow at the centre of the circle . 
 the length of a vector is directly proportional to the distance from the boundary . 
 , width=340 ]    now we explain how the collective decision making process takes place in the flock and how it is related to the cohesion and eventual landing along the vertical direction . 
 we characterize the decision of an individual bird as a binary choice problem @xcite . to each bird 
 @xmath4 we assign an internal state variable @xmath41 such that when @xmath42 the bird continues to cruise above ground and when @xmath43 the bird decides to land . for the cruising state 
 we assume that a bird likes to fly about an altitude @xmath44 on average without deviating too far above or below . 
 however , we expect the elevation of a bird to fluctuate with time pertaining to factors like the noise in the medium and collision avoidance . 
 thus when @xmath42 we consider the vertical motion of the particle to be essentially a random walk bounded by imaginary walls at @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the thickness of the flock . in case the bird decides to land the vertical motion is directed towards the landing surface at @xmath2 . 
 formally we define , @xmath48 & \textrm{if $ s_i(t)=1 $ and $ |\delta(t-\delta t)|>\delta z_0/2 $ } \\ 
 -v &   \textrm{if $ s_i(t)=-1 $ , } \end{array}\right.\ ] ] where @xmath49 takes values @xmath50 with equal probability and @xmath51 , is the amount of deviation from the height @xmath44 at time @xmath52 .    to model the motivational differences in birds we assign to each bird @xmath4 , an inherent switching time @xmath53 @xcite such that if the bird begins an isolated flight at time @xmath54 , it would decide to land at time @xmath55 . 
 we assume that the value of @xmath53 for the bird @xmath4 will in general depend on its energy reserves @xcite and thus in general will be different for different birds . 
 we choose @xmath53 s from a gaussian distribution with a given standard deviation @xmath56 . 
 the value of @xmath56 allows us to control the level of heterogeneity in a flock . 
 although we assign _ a priori _ values of @xmath53 to birds , due to the randomness in the choice of these switching times , they can be thought to be additionally include the effect of the environment such as quality of foraging patches over which the flocks fly .    for a particle in the flock 
 , it will have a finite number of particles in its neighbourhood and therefore will be influenced by their actions while taking a decision . 
 hence the internal state of a particle will be a function of two competing factors , ( i ) its inherent switching time and ( ii ) the internal state of the neighbours , which we assume to be reflected by the nature of their motion . in an approach similar to that of the rfim at zero temperature @xcite we write down : @xmath57\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the propensity of a particle to follow the decision of its neighbours and @xmath59 is the _ local mean field _ through which the bird @xmath4 senses the average decision in its neighbourhood @xmath16 . 
 we expect that the inclination of a bird @xmath4 to land will be enhanced by a resultant motion of birds in @xmath16 towards the landing surface , and also by the number of birds that have already landed . 
 we define @xmath59 at a time @xmath8 as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the average value of @xmath3-component of velocity of active particles and fraction of active particles , respectively , in the neighbourhood @xmath16 at time @xmath8 . at times 
 @xmath63 , the birds on average have no inclination to land and therefore we expect them to maintain a height around @xmath64 without any resultant vertical motion towards the landing surface . 
 in this regime we expect for any particle @xmath4 , @xmath65 and also , @xmath66 , implying that @xmath67 . 
 on the other hand a resultant vertical motion in negative @xmath3-direction would imply @xmath68 . 
 thus in a regime when majority move towards the landing surface at @xmath2 and eventually reach inactive states , we expect @xmath69 . 
 we now move on to characterize the resulting collective landing as a function of different states of collective motion . 
 _ we would like to emphasize at this point that although the detailed description of our model involves specifying nine expressions , the essential concept and the ingredients of the model are rather simple ( spp + rfim ) and the number of independent parameters is low ( @xmath24 , @xmath15 , @xmath70 , @xmath58)_. 
 we note that in our model , the shape of a coherently moving flock , far from the landing regime , is roughly cylindrical with a radius of cross section @xmath71 and thickness @xmath47 . 
 we argue that from the point of view of our model for large flocks @xmath47 will have in general weak or no dependence on the number of birds . 
 we choose the thickness of the flock @xmath47 as the unit to measure distances ( @xmath72 ) . 
 we choose the projected density @xmath73 , the interaction radius @xmath74 and the preferred altitude of flying @xmath75 . in our simulations 
 we take @xmath76 , unless mentioned otherwise , the order of which is typical for moderately large flocks @xcite . 
 also the ratio @xmath77 would be typical in these flocks which have thickness of order @xmath78 m and fly at altitudes of around @xmath79 m. at the time @xmath54 in ( [ rfim ] ) we expect the flock to be already in the steady state of collective motion . 
 so before we switch on time as in ( [ rfim ] ) we evolve a flock to its steady state of motion according to equations ( [ eom - xy ] ) , ( [ eq_snm_pos ] ) and ( [ spin ] ) where each particle @xmath4 has @xmath42 . 
 it is known @xcite that the nature of the collective motion depends on the amplitude of the noise . 
 we find that for sufficiently low values of @xmath24 , all the particles align their directions and the flock as a whole translates in some spontaneously chosen direction parallel to the @xmath27-plane . as the value of @xmath24 
 is increased , the tendency of alignment is gradually lost leading to weak or no translation . 
 however , the actual nature of this transition is not known precisely enough and its detailed investigation is outside of the scope of the present paper . 
 we make an observation that there are two independent time scales in the problem - the time scale of motion and the time scale over which the inherent switching times are distributed . 
 the former is given by @xmath80 which is the time required to move one unit of length ( or half interaction radius @xmath81 ) . 
 in presence of finite amount of noise @xmath24 , this time scale would also govern the mixing between particles . 
 the width of the distribution of @xmath53 s ( @xmath82 ) gives a measure of the time over which the energy reserves of the majority in the flock are exhausted . 
 therefore , when @xmath83 , there is hardly any motion during the collective decision making . 
 when @xmath84 the flock actually translates ( at low values of @xmath24 ) over a long distance during the process . 
 we call the ratio of these two time scales as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 , and we investigate the nature of landing at its different values . 
 we set the time scale for choosing values of @xmath18 and @xmath56 as the time increment @xmath87 . 
 the value of magnitude of velocity @xmath18 is kept around and below @xmath88 so that change in the set of neighbours @xmath16 of any bird @xmath4 is gradual . 
 we choose the value of the parameters for the comoving boundary described by equations ( [ bound-1 ] ) and ( [ bound-2 ] ) to be @xmath89 and @xmath90 . 
 we also observe that parameter @xmath36 controls the degree of asymmetry of the vector field @xmath91 ( [ bound-2 ] ) outside the comoving boundary . for @xmath92 
 the system enters into a rotating phase @xcite , and for @xmath93 the flock has a tendency to accumulate at the boundary .      the role played by the coupling @xmath58 in ( [ rfim ] ) 
 is well known @xcite and has also been the matter of investigation . however , 
 in our model we fix @xmath58 to an optimal value for which we find the desired behaviour , as explained below . in the figure [ trans - land](a ) 
 we compare the process of landing across time for different values of the coupling . for a flock with inherent switching times @xmath94 chosen with a fixed @xmath56 
 we monitor the fraction of active particles @xmath95 with time @xmath8 for different values of @xmath58 . 
 we observe that when @xmath96 the particles become inactive independent of each other at their own switching times as seen from the curve @xmath97 which falls smoothly with time . on choosing @xmath98 
 the behaviour is quite opposite . 
 a very sharp fall occurs in the curve @xmath99 implying that there is indeed a collective decision making taking place when a large number of particles reach inactive states within a short period of time . 
 however , comparing the two curves @xmath97 and @xmath99 it appears that in the latter case , the collective landing occurs at point in time which is much larger than ( by an amount of order @xmath56 ) than the switching times of most of the birds . 
 we find that a much lower value of @xmath100 is relevant biologically . 
 the curve @xmath101 sharply falls indicating collective behaviour and the fall occurs near at a time when about half of the birds have just crossed their inherent switching times .    in the figure [ trans - land](a ) 
 we also plot @xmath102 which is the fraction of birds which have a momentary intention to land at time @xmath8 _ 
 i.e. _ , the fraction of particles with @xmath43 . unlike @xmath101 , the quantity @xmath102 is seen to fluctuate before becoming equal to the maximum value unity . 
 this shows that before finally deciding to land , birds may intermittently change their decision . 
 this is caused by the fluctuations in the vertical motion ( [ spin ] ) of neighbours as well as the changing neighbourhood due to finite value of @xmath24 . 
 however , these fluctuations become only important near the landing regime . 
 we explore an aspect of these fluctuations later . in the figure [ trans - land](b ) 
 we plot the velocity field of a typical flock when the majority has decided to land . 
 denotes the fraction of birds not landed yet as the time @xmath8 progresses . 
 the curves @xmath97 , @xmath101 and @xmath99 correspond to values of coupling @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively . also , @xmath102 shows the fraction of birds in state @xmath43 at time @xmath8 for @xmath100 .

 i.e. _ , @xmath56 scaled by the scale of motion @xmath108 , as indicated by different symbols . 
 inset ( a ) shows variation of @xmath109 _ i.e. _ , @xmath70 scaled by @xmath108 , with noise . 
 inset ( b ) shows the variation of @xmath110 which ignores the first and last @xmath111 of the landings . 
 ( b ) the variation of the spread of the landed flock over the @xmath27-plane , relative to the spread at time @xmath54 , as a function of noise . 
 , width=566 ]      below we quantify the extent to which the presence of the coupling affects the collectiveness in landing as we vary the scaled value of the heterogeneity ( @xmath85 ) . 
 we define a measure of the sharpness of the decrease in the fraction of active particles @xmath112 ( figure [ trans - land ] ) . during the process of landing , 
 we record the times at which individual particles become inactive . 
 then we calculate the standard deviation @xmath70 of the distribution of these landing times . 
 finally , we divide @xmath70 by @xmath56 to get the normalized measure . 
 the dimensionless quantity @xmath113 averaged over different realizations of @xmath114 s , provides a measure of the extent to which the landing of the flock is coherent in time such that @xmath115 implies the complete absence of collective decision making . in the figure [ t2080-r](a ) 
 we plot @xmath113 versus @xmath24 for different values of @xmath85 . 
 we make the following observations . for @xmath116 
 the flock reaches consensus almost in the absence of any motion . as a result 
 there is no variation of @xmath113 with the magnitude of noise . in this regime 
 the value of @xmath70 is governed by the spread of the flock in the steady state along the vertical direction _ 
 i.e. _ , @xmath47 
 . therefore we expect that @xmath117 . in the inset ( a ) of the figure [ t2080-r](a ) 
 we plot the ratio @xmath118 against @xmath24 . 
 it is worth mentioning that the quantity @xmath109 provides an alternate normalization of @xmath70 with respect to the other independent time scale @xmath108(@xmath119 ) . 
 we find that for @xmath85 close to unity , @xmath120 asserting that the landing is coherent and the separation between landing times is due to the width @xmath47 . for larger values of @xmath85 
 the value of @xmath113 also becomes large signifying gradual loss of coherence . 
 we also observe that in general @xmath113 has a maximum for intermediate values of the noise . 
 we find that if we choose to ignore the particles which become inactive either too early or too late , then the level of temporal coherence appears better . for a particular landing 
 we measure the times @xmath121 and @xmath122 at which @xmath111 and @xmath123 of the particles , respectively , in the flock has just become inactive . 
 thus we define , @xmath124 as the width of the time window in which a majority _ i.e. _ , @xmath125 of the particles become inactive . 
 we normalize @xmath126 by the corresponding time window ( @xmath127 ) for a flock with the coupling @xmath96 . in the inset ( b ) of the figure [ t2080-r](a ) 
 we plot @xmath110 versus @xmath24 for different values of @xmath85 . 
 the average behaviour reveals a level of coherence such that two birds originally having their inherent switching times separated by @xmath127 land within a period of around @xmath128 of @xmath127 . 
 we investigate the degree of collectiveness as a function of the distance over which a flock lands in figure [ t2080-r](b ) . 
 we calculate the following quantity : @xmath129 this quantifies the spread of the flock across the landing surface . 
 we normalize the value of this spread ( @xmath130 ) when all particles become inactive by the corresponding value ( @xmath131 ) calculated with the positions of the active particles at time @xmath54 . in the figure [ t2080-r](b ) 
 we plot @xmath132 as function of noise varying values of @xmath85 . for low and moderate values of @xmath85 , 
 the value of @xmath132 is of the order of unity . 
 the landing occurs over a region whose dimensions are comparable to dimensions of the flock .    we observe that in the regime of large @xmath85 , the value of noise plays a major role in deciding the overall nature of landing . 
 for very low values of @xmath24 the flock translates over large distances . due to this translation , 
 the particles reaching inactive states early are unable to influence the decision of the active particles in the flock as the _ com _ moves away from these particles . in this case 
 the landing occurs in few large clusters separated in space and time . in case of higher values of the noise there 
 is weak or no translation of the _ com_. however , the scale of the difference in inherent switching times _ i.e. _ , @xmath56 being very slow as compared to the scale of motion , it provides the scope for a particle with a low value of @xmath53 to diffuse to the boundary . as a result , temporarily the influence of the neighbourhood is weakened . 
 this allows the particle to switch its state and become inactive . 
 initially , the excursions of the particles to the comoving boundary becomes the reason behind independent landings . 
 the shrinking of the boundary ( [ rb ] ) effectively screens ( depending upon the interaction radius @xmath15 ) the active particles from the inactive particles . for moderate values of @xmath24 the path of the _ com _ becomes tortuous . 
 however , the effect of segregation of inactive particles from the active particles still persists . 
 the landing occurs in large number of smaller clusters . 
 we further characterize the above behaviour by the following definition . 
 after the landing we calculate the _ com _ of the particles positioned on the @xmath27-plane . 
 we define the measure of spatial coherence @xmath133 as the fraction of particles that lie within a distance @xmath134 from the _ 
 com_. formally , @xmath135 where , @xmath136 is the position of the @xmath4-th inactive particle , @xmath34 is the position of the _ com _ and @xmath137 is the heaviside step function . 
 we expect from the above observations that @xmath133 is close to unity for a spatially coherent landing and zero in the opposite case .

 inset ( a ) shows the collapse of the previous plots as result of transformation of the horizontal axis from @xmath85 to @xmath147 with @xmath148 and @xmath149 . 
 inset ( b ) shows the variation of the ratio @xmath113 with @xmath85 . 
 ( b ) the variation of @xmath109 as a function of the interaction radius @xmath15 for different values of @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 as indicated by different symbols , in flocks of size @xmath76 . 
 the value of @xmath24 in both ( a ) and ( b ) is @xmath153.,width=566 ]    in the figure [ com - psi](a ) we plot the positions of the birds on the @xmath27-plane after all the birds have landed . 
 the line shows the trajectory of the _ com _ and the circle is drawn with the radius @xmath138 about the centre of mass calculated with the final positions of the landed birds . 
 majority of the birds lying within the circle shows that in such a case spatial coherence is retained . in the figure [ com - psi](b ) we plot @xmath133 as function of @xmath85 for the value of @xmath139 . 
 the different plots corresponds to different system sizes . 
 the decrease in @xmath133 with increase in @xmath85 is consistent with all the previous observations . in the inset ( a ) of the figure [ com - psi](b ) 
 we obtain a collapse of the data after rescaling @xmath85 by @xmath145 . 
 the variation of @xmath154 with the system size @xmath146 , as shown in the inset ( b ) , is found to be @xmath155 where @xmath156 ( we note that the dimension of the flock varies as @xmath157 ) . 
 this relation suggests that with the increase in the system size there is an increase in the value of @xmath85 below which spatial coherence is expected . 
 we investigate the dependence on system size of the temporal behaviour in the next paragraph . 
 in the figure [ t - r](a ) we plot @xmath109 versus @xmath85 for four different system sizes for value of noise @xmath139 . 
 the figure reveals how the spread in actual landing times increases with the value of @xmath85 . a data collapse in the inset ( a ) reveals a scaling relation of the form : @xmath158^{\frac{1}{n^\alpha } } , \label{lambda - scale}\ ] ] with @xmath148 and @xmath149 . in general , we expect @xmath159 to be function of the parameters like @xmath39 and @xmath15 . 
 the equation ( [ lambda - scale ] ) suggests that for a fixed value of @xmath85 , with the increase in the system size there is increase in temporal coherence . 
 we also plot the corresponding values of the ratio @xmath113 in the inset ( b ) . 
 the plot shows how this ratio approaches the maximum value unity with the increase in the value of @xmath85 . 
 the reason for the rise in @xmath113 for very low values of @xmath85 is already stated with respect to the figure [ t2080-r](a ) . in all the above investigations we have assumed that the interaction radius controlling the average number of neighbours of any particle is @xmath74 . 
 we now address the issue of having larger ( or smaller ) interaction radii . in the figure [ t - r](b ) 
 we plot the variation of @xmath109 with the value of @xmath15 for different values of @xmath85 with value of noise set at @xmath139 . 
 we find significant decrease in the spread @xmath109 for large values of @xmath15 . 
 this suggests that global information can lead to a more coherent decision making process .     of the maximum depth @xmath160 of excursions below the flock by birds , before returning to the flock as a result of temporarily reverting from the decision to land . 
 the parameter sets indicated by symbols are @xmath161 , @xmath162 ( circles ) and @xmath106 , @xmath107 ( squares ) . the solid line has a slope @xmath163 and is a guide to the eye . 
 ( b ) the probability density function @xmath164 of the distance travelled by the centre of mass of birds in flight , @xmath165 between consecutive time steps . 
 the parameter sets indicated by symbols are same as in the case of ( a ) . 
 the measured slopes of the power - law fits to the curves are around @xmath166 . in both ( 
 a ) and ( b ) the value of @xmath167 , @xmath168 and the magnitude of the velocity @xmath18 controls the lower cut - off of the power - law decays.,width=529 ] 
 lastly , we focus on the nature of fluctuations during the landing process . as a result of the decision reversals in birds under the influence from the neighbourhood ( as reflected by @xmath102 in the figure [ trans - land](a ) ) 
 we find that birds originally moving towards the landing surface sometimes return back to the cruising altitude . 
 we characterize these fluctuations by the maximum depth @xmath160 to which a bird makes an excursion before returning to an altitude greater than @xmath169 . in the figure [ aval - dcm](a ) 
 we plot the probability density @xmath170 . 
 we find that the distribution of @xmath160 is a power - law decay bounded by a minimum and maximum governed by the magnitude of velocity @xmath18 and the maximum possible depth @xmath44 , respectively . 
 we also study the jumps that occur in position of the _ com _ 
 ( on the @xmath27 plane ) of flying birds once the landing process starts . 
 as is seen from the figure [ com - psi](a ) the trajectory of the _ com _ becomes irregular near the end . 
 the _ com _ actually jumps from a cluster which ceases to move to a cluster which continues moving . 
 we construct the probability density @xmath164 for the separation @xmath165 between the centres of mass at two consecutive time steps . 
 we find that @xmath164 has a fat tail during the landing process . in the figure [ aval - dcm](b ) 
 we plot the tail of @xmath164 after binning . 
 the plots reveals power law decays with close by exponents . 
 the power law has a cut - off which governed by @xmath138 . 
 in this paper we have investigated the interplay between the dynamics of collective motion and collective decision making . in particular 
 we have presented a model for landing of bird flocks . 
 we have identified the relevant scales in such a problem and we have worked in the coupling regime which is expected to be biologically relevant . 
 it appears that higher values of the coupling delays the process of the global opinion shift . 
 we have characterized the degree of the resulting collective behaviour by different measures . 
 we found that  as a function of the few parameters of our model  the collective switching from the flying to the landing state is indeed much sharper than the distribution of the individual ( inherent ) landing intentions . among the several interesting features of the model we proposed 
 , we showed that if the flock is subject to larger fluctuations , the spatial spreading of the fully landed flock becomes smaller due to a better mixing of the information about the momentary landing intentions of the birds . 
 we also find that there is a characteristic value of heterogeneity which scales with the size of the flock . 
 below this value of heterogeneity , flocks remain spatially coherent in the process of landing and above this value , the coherence is lost . 
 in addition we have formulated a boundary condition which is pertinent to models of flocking . 
 we believe that the approach we proposed is also relevant for many other systems where abrupt behavioural changes are observed . 
 possible applications include various kinds of animal or even robotic groups in which an almost instantaneous global switching to a new desired state takes place .

93,"in the solar system , there are many small bodies such as asteroids and comets . 
 since these small astronomical objects could keep the ancient information of the history of the solar system , a lot of efforts have been devoted to investigations of these objects so far  ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 for instance , the asteroid itokawa was explored by the japanese space craft _ hayabusa _ from september 2005 . 
 the exploration uncovered the details of itokawa s surface terrain . 
 itokawa is covered by various sizes of granular matter such as regolith , pebbles , and boulders  @xcite . 
 moreover , migrations and sorting of the regolith could occur on the surface of itokawa  @xcite , although the surface gravity of itokawa is extremely low . 
 impact craters located on the surface of itokawa were very subtle , i.e. , they show indistinct morphologies  @xcite . 
 this is probably due to the erasure of the craters by seismic shaking  @xcite . 
 in addition , tiny samples returned from itokawa allow us to analyze the detail of its history . 
 @xcite revealed that itokawa s surface grains are relatively young in terms of cosmic - rays exposure . 
 the estimated age is approximately eight million years . besides , using x - ray microtomography ,  @xcite found that some particles had rounded edges . 
 all these facts suggest that the surface of itokawa would be active and continue to be renewed until recently 
 . one possible explanation of such young surface is the regolith convection caused by impact - induced seismic shaking . 
 although the direct measurement of the seismic wave has not been achieved , @xcite and @xcite studied the possibility of global seismic shaking of asteroid eros in order to explain its surface modification processes . 
 they built a model of seismic shaking by considering the attenuating diffusion of the seismic wave . 
 @xcite partially applied the model to the asteroid itokawa and showed that the global regolith convection might occur even by small - scale impacts . to unlock the regolith grains network supported by gravity , the maximum acceleration induced by the seismic shaking has to be greater than the gravitational acceleration . 
 @xcite revealed that this criterion can be satisfied by a small - scale impact since the gravity on the surface of itokawa @xmath3 is very small , @xmath4 m / s@xmath5  @xcite . 
 the value of @xmath3 is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the earth s gravitational acceleration , @xmath6 m / s@xmath5 . 
 the evaluation is still qualitative since they only assessed the onset criterion of the regolith convection . 
 while the quantitative assessment of the convective velocity is necessary to discuss the feasibility of the regolith convection , there have been very few such studies . 
 granular convection can be generally observed in a granular matter under the mechanical vibration . when a granular matter is subjected to a steady vertical vibration , granular convection 
 is readily induced . 
 if the vibrated granular matter is polydisperse , the size segregation of grains occurs usually in vertical direction . 
 this vibration - induced size segregation is called brazil nut effect ( bne ) . 
 the bne can be caused by the granular convection  @xcite . 
 this means that the grains can be migrated and sorted simultaneously by vibration . 
 although the regolith convection accompanied by migration and sorting seems to be a natural outcome of global seismic shaking , the scaling approach to the granular convective velocity is needed to discuss the consistency between regolith convection and observational data such as surface age of the asteroid . 
 therefore , we experimentally measure and scale the velocity of granular convection in this study , as a first - step approach to this problem .    fundamental nature of granular convection itself is an intriguing problem . 
 the granular convection has long been studied both by experiments  @xcite and numerical simulations  @xcite . the onset of granular convection depends on the maximum acceleration of the applied vibration . 
 if the maximum acceleration is less than the gravitational acceleration , any granular convection does not occur at all  ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 thus the dimensionless parameter @xmath7 , which represents the balance between the maximum vibrational acceleration and the gravitational acceleration @xmath1 , has been used to characterize the behavior of granular convection . 
 @xmath7 is defined as , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vibration amplitude and @xmath10 is the frequency .    in this study , 
 the scaling method is applied to the analysis of granular convective velocity . 
 we are interested in asteroidal - scale granular convection while the actual experiment is limited within the laboratory scale . 
 in such a situation , the scaling is the only way to derive a meaningful quantitative relation . in the scaling analysis , 
 dimensionless parameters such as @xmath7 are useful since they do not depend on the system of unit . 
 the weak point of the scaling analysis is its arbitrariness . 
 of course , @xmath7 is one of the most important dimensionless parameters to discuss the vibrated granular matter . 
 however , the choice of the important dimensionless parameter is not unique . 
 specifically , another dimensionless parameter called shaking parameter @xmath11 was firstly introduced by  @xcite and recently used to describe the transitions among the granular leidenfrost , bouncing bed , undulations , convection , and so on  @xcite . 
 particularly , @xmath11 is relevant to characterize a strongly shaken shallow granular convection  @xcite . 
 @xmath11 is defined as , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the constitutive grains diameter . 
 @xmath11 denotes the balance between the squared vibrational velocity and the squared gravitational velocity . 
 furthermore , @xmath11 can be also obtained by the natural non - dimensionalization of the granular - hydrodynamic model for the strongly shaken granular convection  @xcite . using the aforementioned dimensionless parameters 
 , we would like to find a useful scaling relation between granular convective velocity , the gravitational acceleration , and other parameters . 
 therefore , we carry out a systematic laboratory experiments of the vibration - induced granular convection 
 .    this paper is constructed by following sections . in section 
 [ sec : experiment ] , we explain the experimental setup and how to measure the convective velocity . section  [ sec : results ] shows the characterization of some convective - roll patterns and the result of the scaling . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss physical meaning and tentative implication of the scaling to the microgravity environment . 
 section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains a conclusions . 
 a schematic illustration of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig .  [ 
 fig : setup ] . 
 the experimental setup consists of a cylinder made by plexiglass of its height @xmath14 mm and inner radius @xmath15 ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or @xmath18 mm ) . 
 glass beads are poured in the cylindrical cell to make a granular bed of the height @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , or @xmath22 mm . 
 the system is mounted on an electromechanical vibrator ( emic 513-b / a ) and shaken vertically . 
 the vibration frequency @xmath10 is varied from @xmath23 to @xmath24 hz and @xmath7 is varied from @xmath25 to @xmath26 . 
 the grains used in this study are glass beads . 
 most of experiments are carried out with glass beads of diameter @xmath27 mm ( as - one corp . 
 bz08 ) and some of them are performed with glass beads of @xmath28 or @xmath25 mm ( as - one corp . 
 bz04 , bz2 ) . 
 size dispersion of glass beads is less than @xmath29% , and the true density of glass beads is @xmath30 kg / m@xmath31 . 
 [ 0.9 ]    to measure the granular convective velocity , particle imaging velocimetry ( piv ) method is utilized  @xcite . 
 motions of glass beads are filmed by a high - speed camera ( photoron sa-5 ) through a transparent side wall . to erase the memory effect of granular matter , 
 one minute pre - vibration is applied before each experimental realization . 
 this means that we measure the steady granular convection . 
 while the actual impact - induced regolith convection might be transient , we have to concentrate on the steady convection to eliminate the memory effect . 
 the frame rate is fixed at @xmath32 fps and spatial resolution of the image ranges from @xmath33 @xmath34m / pixel to @xmath35 @xmath34m / pixel depending on the experimental conditions . 
 the high - speed images are acquired for @xmath36 s. since each image consists of @xmath37 pixels , the size of field of view ranges from @xmath38 to @xmath39 mm@xmath5 . 
 raw data images are shown in backgrounds of figs . 
 [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot ] and [ fig : vectorplot ] . since it is hard to completely follow all the grains motion , we use piv method instead of the direct particle tracking . in the analyses of figs . 
 [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot ] and [ fig : vectorplot ] ( a ) , each instantaneous image is divided into @xmath40 boxes , i.e. , each box consists of @xmath41 pixels . 
 note that the number of image partitioning depends on the experimental condition . 
 then the velocity at each box is computed by detecting a peak of the cross - correlation between two different time snapshots . 
 obtained ( time - averaged ) examples of the velocity field are shown by colored vectors in figs . 
 [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot ] and [ fig : vectorplot ] . an interval time to compute the velocity ( cross - correlation ) 
 is kept constant so that it corresponds to a multiple of the period of vibration , i.e. , two cross - correlated images are kept in same phase . 
 for instance , @xmath42 s time interval is used for @xmath43 hz vibration . 
 if we use a full temporal resolution to calculate the velocity field , vibrational motion of individual grains can be captured just like @xcite measurement . 
 however , we are mainly interested in the global convective motion rather than such microscopic vibration . therefore , we use phase - matching images to compute the velocity .            as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot ] , convective - velocity vectors are decomposed into @xmath44 ( vertical ) and @xmath45 ( horizontal ) directions . 
 they are averaged along the horizontal axis since we are mainly focusing on the axisymmetric convective flow ( like fig . 
 [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot ] ) for the reason mentioned later 
 . then we obtain vertical and horizontal components of velocities as functions of @xmath44 , respectively as , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in fig . 
 [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot ] , panels ( b ) and ( c ) respectively show @xmath46 and @xmath47 computed from the velocity field shown in panel ( a ) . the positive direction of @xmath44 axis is taken to downward , and @xmath48 corresponds to the top surface of the granular bed . 
 @xmath49 is the center of container . above the surface of granular bed ( @xmath50 ) , 
 saltations of grains are dominant and the measured velocity becomes random . 
 this is the reason of large errors in @xmath51 and @xmath52 at @xmath50 ( fig . 
 [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot](b , c ) ) . 
 first , we are going to focus on the global structure of the granular convective motion . 
 we find that the global structure shows a transition from a single roll to a toroidal roll as @xmath10 increases . in the former state , 
 grains rise up on the one side wall and fall down on the opposite side wall . 
 thus , in this state , the resultant velocity field shows a certain circularity . due to this circularity , 
 a gradient of the velocity field is observed as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : vectorplot](a ) . in this single - roll state , 
 the degree of velocity gradient or circularity strongly depends on the viewing spot . in the latter state , 
 on the other hand , grains rise up at the center of container and fall down on all over the wall homogeneously . 
 the inner structure of this granular convective mode has been observed by using the magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) method  @xcite . in other words , 
 this toroidal convection state is axisymmetric . 
 typical examples of raw images for such homogeneous convection are shown in figs . 
 [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot](a ) and [ fig : vectorplot](b ) . 
 a phase diagram of the global structure in @xmath10-@xmath7 space is displayed in fig .  [ 
 fig : phase_diagram ] . as seen in fig . 
 [ fig : phase_diagram ] , the transition occurs at @xmath53 hz . 
 the transition is almost independent of @xmath7 at least under the current experimental condition . 
 note that the phase diagram is constructed only based on the experiment with @xmath27 mm glass beads . besides , 
 although we define two types of convective roll structures , this classification is not conclusive . 
 detail measurements of inner structures of convective rolls are necessary to completely categorize the convective structures . 
 the current classification is still tentative since it is based only on the observation by eye .    -@xmath7 space with @xmath54 mm , @xmath55 mm and @xmath27 mm . 
 the symbols represent the observed structures of granular convection ; open circles correspond to the single - roll state and cross markers indicate the toroidal - roll state . 
 a phase boundary can be found around @xmath56 hz independently of @xmath7.,title=""fig : "" ]      next , we analyze the convective velocity . since the main motivation of this study is to characterize the scaling behavior of the representative convective velocity in a vibrated granular matter , we are going to focus on the toroidal - roll ( axisymmetric ) state . in the single - roll state , 
 convective velocity is spatially heterogeneous in horizontal direction as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : vectorplot](a ) . 
 as mentioned above , the observable velocity field depends on the camera angle since the rolling direction is stochastically determined and can not be controlled in the single - roll state . 
 such a state is inappropriate to extract a representative velocity of the system . 
 by contrast , the toroidal - roll state is rather homogeneous everywhere in @xmath45 direction of the side wall as shown in figs . 
 [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot](a ) and [ fig : vectorplot](b ) . 
 furthermore , @xmath52 is always almost zero at any @xmath44 ( fig . 
 [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot](c ) ) , and @xmath57 is basically a simple decreasing function of @xmath44 ( fig . 
 [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot](b ) ) in the toroidal - roll state . 
 @xcite found a qualitatively similar velocity profile in the vibrated granular convection . 
 they also used the maximum velocity to characterize the convective velocity . 
 therefore , we use the same strategy in the analysis of the representative convective velocity . 
 namely , we employ the maximum value of the vertical component of velocity , @xmath58 , as a representative convective velocity to characterize the velocity field . 
 temporal homogeneity of @xmath51 is also examined . in the toroidal - roll state , 
 its spatial structure of the convective velocity is symmetric and simple as discussed above . 
 then , how about the temporal structure ? 
 [ fig : time_changing ] , a typical time series data of @xmath59 ( @xmath58 at each time @xmath60 ) is shown . while @xmath58 basically looks more or less steady , a sort of intermittent velocity spikes 
 can be observed in fig . 
 [ fig : time_changing ] . 
 this slight intermittency might come from the inherent complexity of the granular flow due to the frictional effect . 
 at @xmath61 , @xmath62 hz , @xmath27 mm , @xmath55 mm , and @xmath54 mm . 
 intermittent spikes can be observed as well as random fluctuation around the mean value . 
 a horizontal solid line indicates the average value ( @xmath63 mm / s ) and dotted lines show standard deviation levels ( @xmath64 mm / s).,title=""fig : "" ]    the distribution of velocities @xmath65 obtained from the data of fig .  [ 
 fig : time_changing ] is displayed in fig . 
 [ fig : histogram ] . 
 here , @xmath65 indicates the number in the range of @xmath66 and @xmath67 mm / s is the bin size . 
 the distribution has a clear peak around @xmath68 mm / s . 
 however , an asymmetric tail can be observed at large @xmath58 regime . 
 whereas this statistical property of the convective velocity field could contain rich physics , here we neglect the asymmetric structure for simplicity s sake . in fig . 
 [ fig : histogram ] , the mean value and standard deviation of the entire data set are shown as a filled circle and an error bar shown above the histogram . 
 more detail analyses of @xmath59 by its distribution and temporal correlation etc . 
 are interesting future problems .     computed from the data in fig . 
 [ fig : time_changing ] . 
 width of each bin is @xmath69 mm / s . 
 one can confirm the peak of @xmath70 around @xmath71 mm / s and the asymmetric tail in large velocity regime . above the histogram , mean and standard deviation are shown as a filled circle and an error bar , respectively ( @xmath72 mm / s ) . 
 the corresponding standard error is @xmath73 mm / s which is smaller than the size of the circle mark.,title=""fig : "" ]      finally , a scaling of the granular convective velocity is derived . as a first step of the scaling , we focus on the effect of vibration - conditions ( @xmath10 and @xmath7 ) by fixing the geometric conditions : @xmath27 mm , @xmath55 mm , and @xmath54 mm . 
 as mentioned above , we regard @xmath58 as a representative granular convective velocity . 
 more precisely , we use the maximum value of @xmath46 profile ( e.g. , fig . 
 [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot](b ) ) as @xmath58 . in order to discuss the scale - free nature , 
 a relation among dimensionless parameters should be analyzed . 
 thus @xmath58 is normalized to the characteristic velocity created by gravity as , @xmath74 in fig . 
 [ fig : g_scaling ] , @xmath75 vs. @xmath7 for various @xmath10 is shown . 
 one can confirm that all the @xmath75 data are similar increasing functions of @xmath7 . 
 however , these specific values depend not only on @xmath7 but also on @xmath10 . therefore , it is hard to obtain a universal scale - free relation from this plot . 
 in other words , sole @xmath7 can not characterize the granular convective velocity very well . while @xcite used @xmath7 and the normalized bed height to collapse the convective velocity data , 
 here we consider a different quantity to deduce a simple power - law form for the granular convective velocity . 
 note that the specific functional form of the granular convective velocity was not obtained by @xcite . 
 we find that the shaking parameter @xmath11 is a relevant dimensionless parameter to scale @xmath75 . 
 corresponding scaling plot is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : s_scaling ] . all of the @xmath75 data collapse to a power - law form , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a characteristic exponent obtained by the data fitting shown as a dashed line in fig . 
 [ fig : s_scaling ] . 
 the solid line corresponds to @xmath78 which is determined by the scaling with various system size data ( fig . 
 [ fig : sl_scaling ] ) . as mentioned before 
 , @xmath11 represents the balance between the vibrational and gravitational velocities . 
 thus it is rather natural that another velocity balance ( convective velocity vs. gravitational velocity ; @xmath79 ) is scaled by @xmath11 . 
 the range of @xmath11 we used in this study is slightly different from that in the previous studies . in @xcite , 
 @xmath11 was used to characterize the onset of convection in the strongly shaken shallow granular bed . in this study 
 , we experimentally confirm that @xmath11 is also useful to the scaling analysis of the convective velocity in a weakly shaken thick granular bed . 
 the range of @xmath11 for our experiment is from @xmath80 to @xmath81 . 
 although the order of this regime is about one order of magnitude smaller than that in the experiment of  @xcite ( @xmath82 ) , the current experimental result is also well explained by @xmath11 .     by @xmath7 . 
 each open symbol shows the data of glass beads bed of @xmath27 mm , @xmath55 mm , and @xmath54 mm . 
 while a systematic correlation between @xmath75 and @xmath7 can be observed , a universal form can not be obtained solely by @xmath7 scaling.,title=""fig : "" ]     by @xmath11 . 
 colors and markers used are identical to those in fig . 
 [ fig : g_scaling ] . 
 the dashed line represents the power law fit ( eqs . 
 ( [ eq : fitting ] ) ) . the slope ( power ) of the dashed line 
 is computed as @xmath77 . 
 the solid line corresponds to @xmath78 which is obtained by the least square search for all the data including various system size parameters ( fig . 
 [ fig : sl_scaling ] ) . 
 , title=""fig : "" ]    as a next step of the scaling , we investigate the system size dependence of @xmath75 by the varying geometric parameters : bed height @xmath83 and its radius @xmath15 . in fig . 
 [ fig : aspect_ratio ] , the data of @xmath75 vs.  @xmath84 for various @xmath7 and @xmath10 are shown . 
 non - axisymmetric convection patterns such as a single - roll state are sometimes found in the experiment at some @xmath84 . due to the inhomogeneity , 
 the representative velocities in these states show extremely large dispersion . 
 since we restrict ourselves within the analysis of representative velocity in the homogeneous convection , these data are excluded from the analysis . as shown in fig . 
 [ fig : aspect_ratio ] , we find that @xmath75 is roughly independent of @xmath84 although its specific value clearly depends on vibrational conditions ( @xmath7 and @xmath10 ) . 
 this simple relation @xmath85 suggests that @xmath75 can be scaled equivalently both by @xmath15 and @xmath83 . 
 namely , @xmath75 is the increasing function both of @xmath15 and @xmath83 
 . then we can reduce the number of geometric parameters , i.e. , @xmath15 and @xmath83 can be unified into a single parameter . in specific , a dimensionless parameter for the system size @xmath86 can be introduced by using grains diameter @xmath13 as , @xmath87     to the aspect ratio of the shaken granular bed , @xmath84 . 
 colors and shapes of markers indicate vibrational conditions as denoted in the legend . 
 all the data points are originated from the experiments with glass beads of @xmath27 mm ( bz08 ) . 
 we remove the data of single - roll state from this plot . 
 although the level of @xmath75 depends on vibrational conditions , it is roughly independent of @xmath84 . 
 dashed lines are the average levels for each condition.,title=""fig : "" ]    to prove the validity of the dimensionless parameter @xmath86 , @xmath13 should be varied as well as @xmath15 and @xmath83 . 
 therefore , we also examine the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath88 . for this purpose , 
 the aspect ratio is fixed ( @xmath54 mm and @xmath55 mm ) and glass beads of @xmath28 mm ( bz04 ) and @xmath89 mm ( bz2 ) are used in the experiment . while @xmath75 of bz04 is in the same order as the bz08 case 
 , @xmath75 of bz2 is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of bz08 , under the same vibrational condition . 
 this is due to the effect of crystallization which prevents the convective motion . 
 besides , the solidification ( complete crystallization ) of glass beads bed occurs when bz2 is shaken by @xmath90 . 
 the crystallization is unavoidable for the larger grains as long as we use nearly mono - disperse spherical grains . whereas the number of data points is not enough to discuss the specific scaling form 
 , we qualitatively confirm that the convective velocity is a decreasing function of @xmath13 . 
 altogether , we can assume a simple scaling relation among these dimensionless parameters to compile all the data . 
 the assumed scaling form is written as , @xmath91 the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 are computed by searching the least square point in the range of @xmath94 and @xmath95 . 
 the least square fitting in fig . 
 ( [ fig : sl_scaling ] ) is computed with weighting of the standard deviation ( velocity scattering degree ) . 
 the obtained values are @xmath78 and @xmath96 . 
 and the computed numerical prefactor is @xmath97 . 
 the scaling result for all the experimentally obtained data is shown in fig .  [ 
 fig : sl_scaling ] . 
 as can be seen , the data are basically well scaled by the variable @xmath98 . the corresponding scaling line ( @xmath99 ) 
 is also plotted in fig . 
 [ fig : s_scaling ] as a solid line . 
 the value of @xmath92 is slightly improved from the fixed system size case ( fig . 
 ( [ fig : s_scaling ] ) ) . in fig . 
 [ fig : sl_scaling ] , two data points deviate significantly from the scaling . 
 this deviation comes from the crystallization effect of large glass beads ( bz2 ) . 
 the inset of fig . 
 [ fig : sl_scaling ] shows a linear plot of the same data . 
 this scaling relation is the main result of this experimental investigation . 
 there are some missing parameters in the scaling of eq . 
 ( [ eq : sl_scaling ] ) . for example 
 , density is not involved in it . 
 that is , the scaling is a kind of kinematic one . 
 the density dependence has to be clarified to understand the dynamic scaling including the effect of inertia  @xcite . 
 perhaps , this would not be so critical because the density of glass beads ( @xmath30 kg / m@xmath31 ) is close to ( at least in the same order with ) the real regolith density ( e.g. , @xmath100 kg / m@xmath31 for itokawa  @xcite ) . 
 another example of the missing parameters is the cohesive force among grains . 
 although the gravitational force is very small on the surface of small asteroids , the cohesive effect would instead play a crucial role  @xcite . 
 it is hard to check this effect by the current experiment since we do not vary the cohesiveness of grains . in the current experiment , 
 the cohesive force is negligible since it is much smaller than the gravitational force . 
 we assume that interstitial air and electrostatic effects do not play essential roles , i.e. , they are much smaller than gravity effect . indeed , the air effect is negligible as long as we use @xmath101 mm grains ( see e.g. , supplementary information of @xcite ) . 
 we also think that the gravitational force is more dominant than the electrostatic force for the bulk convective motion of glass beads . 
 in fact , while we saw a few glass beads sticking on the sidewall due to the electrostatic effect , those were really few . the electrostatic effect might slightly affect the convective motion . 
 however , we consider it can not be a dominant effect . 
 a much more serious problem is the absence of frictional properties in the scaling . 
 the frictional properties are a possible origin of intermittent velocity fluctuation shown in fig . 
 [ fig : time_changing ] . 
 in addition , it might affect the representative value of convective velocity . 
 frictional properties relate to the shape of constitutive grains . obviously , actual regolith grains shapes are irregular and rough . by a preliminary experiment 
 , we actually confirm that @xmath58 significantly reduces when the rough - shaped sand grains are used . on the contrary 
 , some previous studies have reported that the friction can enhance the convective velocity  @xcite . moreover , 
 the grain - wall friction is different from grain - grain friction . 
 the grain - wall friction could be a reason of the onset of granular convection in this experiment . 
 the detailed study for the effect of friction is a very important future problem . 
 the origin of granular convection in the current experiment is plausibly the effect of wall . as already mentioned , the structure of the convective roll changes spontaneously when @xmath10 or @xmath15 are varied 
 this implies that there is an inherent length scale in the granular convection . 
 however , the wall effect to the velocity scaling is still significant even in split ( doubled ) roll state since we observe the grains motion on the wall . 
 moreover , it has been shown that experimental conditions including the container s shape and interstitial air influence the convective roll structure  @xcite . in these previous studies 
 , the interaction between grains and wall seems to be a key factor . 
 nevertheless , astronomical objects obviously maintain their own shapes without any wall . 
 it is hard to eliminate the container wall effect in usual granular experiments even in microgravity environment . 
 rather , highly heterogenous structure of small asteroids might work as an effective wall which triggers the granular convection . 
 put another way , there could be a lot of effective boundaries and/or gradients of frictional properties in actual small asteroids . 
 thus it is not quite clear whether the granular convection occurs globally or locally in small asteroids . 
 the structure of the velocity profile @xmath46 is informative both for the granular physics and planetary science . in the previous studies of granular convection  @xcite 
 , convective velocity decays rapidly ( exponentially ) with depth . 
 and the deep region of the vibrated granular matter is almost at rest . 
 if this peculiar regime called _ frozen zone _ presents in the real asteroids convection , the regolith migration occurs only within a shallow region . in the current experiment , 
 most of velocity profiles do not show the clear frozen zone . 
 the convective velocity decays calmly as typically shown in fig . 
 [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot](b ) . 
 thus the convective velocity is simply scaled by @xmath86 with the nontrivial exponent @xmath102 . 
 if the frozen zone is clearly observed , the convective velocity would be saturated at a certain @xmath83 , and it can not be simply scaled by a single exponent . actually , the frozen zone can be partially observed also in the current experiment under small @xmath7 , large @xmath10 , and large @xmath83 conditions . 
 since we are interested in the principal flow velocity of the granular convection , we have focused only on the axisymmetric convective state and its maximum velocity @xmath58 , in this study . 
 detailed analysis of @xmath46 profile is a next important step to reveal the granular convection dynamics that relates to the depth of regolith convection occurring in small astronomical objects . 
 so far , the scaling form for the granular convective velocity has been discussed on the basis of systematically performed experimental results . in this subsection 
 , we discuss the implication of the obtained scaling law . 
 the scaling of eq . 
 ( [ eq : sl_scaling ] ) can be rewritten by considering its physical meaning . 
 then the scaling is compared with a recent experimental result of two - dimensional granular convection . 
 equation  ( [ eq : sl_scaling ] ) can be transformed into a following form , @xmath103 this form is more understandable than eq . 
 ( [ eq : sl_scaling ] ) . 
 the representative velocity @xmath58 is expressed by a power law product of two characteristic velocities : gravitational @xmath104 and vibrational @xmath105 . 
 in addition , the system size dependence is scaled by the last factor @xmath106 . 
 the scaling of eq . 
 ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) is qualitatively consistent with a recent experiment performed by  @xcite . 
 they investigated the convective - driven bne and found that the convective velocity linearly depends on @xmath105 . 
 to better explain the experimental data , the use of @xmath105 was much better than @xmath7 . according to eq . 
 ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) , convective velocity depends on vibrational velocity as , @xmath107 . 
 these two experimental results show a good agreement . however , they reported the presence of critical vibrational velocity below which the granular convection was not induced . 
 this critical vibrational velocity probably corresponds to the onset criterion . in the current analysis 
 , however , we do not clearly confirm this offset in the scaling ( see fig . 
 [ fig : sl_scaling ] ) . 
 instead , we varied @xmath11 over two orders of magnitude to obtain the power - law relation . 
 the range of @xmath11 and other parameters were relatively narrow in the study of @xcite since they are not interested in the scale - free form . 
 thus they reported the linear relation between the convective velocity and the vibrational velocity . on the other hand 
 , we obtain the scaling ( power law ) relation between the convective velocity , the vibrational velocity , and the gravitational velocity . 
 it should be noted that the system size dependence of the scaling is bounded . according to eq . 
 ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) , the value of @xmath58 can be very large when @xmath108 becomes large . 
 this condition corresponds to a large @xmath109 or a small @xmath13 case . at the limit of @xmath110 or @xmath111 
 , @xmath58 diverges . 
 however , such a divergence does not occur in the actual granular convection . 
 the convective roll size can not grow to the infinitely large size . 
 in fact , we experimentally observed the split of the convective roll ( double toroidal - roll ) in a very shallow layer , although such a split rarely happened . 
 this preliminary observation indicates that there might be an intrinsic length scale which determines the maximum convective roll size . 
 since the current experimental system size is limited , it is hard to systematically reveal the effect of this intrinsic length scale . at a small @xmath13 regime , 
 on the other hand , the cohesive force among grains becomes dominant instead of the gravitational force . 
 the current scaling form can not be applied to such a situation . 
 the detailed investigation on the size - dependent scaling form for more widely spreading size regime is an important future problem . to investigate the small @xmath13 regime , 
 the experiment under the vacuum condition is also necessary . 
 finally , the experimentally obtained scaling is cast into a form in which the gravity effect can be directly evaluated . 
 since the interpretation of scaling is not unique in general , we have to take a special care for its understanding . whereas the discussion in this subsection is speculative , the result is consistent with other related works . 
 moreover , the obtained scaling includes various parameters such as vibration frequency and system size . 
 thus the form is very efficient to estimate the timescale of regolith convection occurring on the surface of small asteroid . 
 recently , some granular flow experiments were performed under microgravity conditions created by parabolic flights  @xcite . 
 @xcite used a taylor - couette geometry and measured both sheared and convective flows induced by the shearing . 
 particularly , @xcite reported the effect of gravity to the sheared granular convection . 
 they claimed that the gravity plays an essential role to make a stiff grains network in a bulk granular matter . 
 such a grains network is necessary to transform a shear stress into a driving force of the convective motion . 
 therefore , the granular convective velocity under the microgravity became almost zero . 
 moreover , the convective velocity under the high - gravity condition became large  @xcite . 
 @xcite measured the rising velocity of intruders in convective - driven bne under the reduced gravity . 
 they found that the rising velocity is almost linearly scaled by the gravity .    to compare the current result with above - mentioned microgravity experiments , 
 here we evaluate the gravity influence to the convective velocity based on eq . 
 ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) . at a glance of eq . 
 ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) , the convective velocity is scaled as @xmath112 . 
 this scaling implicitly assumes the fixed @xmath105 under different @xmath1 environment . 
 this assumption is not practical to estimate the granular convective velocity induced under the different @xmath1 . 
 for instance , under the microgravity environment , very small vibrational acceleration is enough to satisfy the onset criterion of granular convection ( @xmath113 ) . however , if @xmath105 is fixed to consider the granular convective velocity under the microgravity environment , the corresponding @xmath7 becomes extremely large . 
 it is not a realistic assumption . instead 
 , the value of @xmath7 should be fixed to estimate the convective velocity by means of similarity law . 
 in fact , fixed @xmath7 was used to discuss the possibility of convection on the surface of itokawa  @xcite . @xcite 
 also fixed @xmath7 to discuss @xmath1 dependence . 
 therefore , the typical vibrational velocity should be written as @xmath114 instead of @xmath105 . 
 then , eq .  ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) can be modified into the following form , @xmath115 according to eq . 
 ( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) , @xmath58 depends on @xmath1 as , @xmath116 . 
 the value @xmath117 is close to unity . 
 this result is qualitatively similar to @xcite and @xcite . 
 however , note that we do not directly vary the gravitational acceleration . 
 the @xmath1 dependence is indirectly deduced from the scaling . besides , the convective motion of  @xcite was induced by shear in a taylor - couette cell . thus the similarity is rather qualitative . 
 using eq . 
 ( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) and a model of seismic shaking induced by impacts  @xcite , we are able to estimate the convective velocity for various astronomical objects . 
 to do that , we have to be careful in the estimate of @xmath106 . 
 whereas its value strongly affects the estimate of @xmath58 , it is still very uncertain 
 . then it might be possible to evaluate the surface age ( resurfacing timescale ) of the microgravity asteroid by considering the population of impactors . 
 such an estimate for itokawa or eros is an interesting application of this scaling . 
 this topic is a part of ongoing investigation . 
 an experimental study of the granular convection was performed with a vertically shaken glass beads bed . 
 the maximum convective velocity @xmath58 was measured by piv method . 
 although the @xmath58 was measured on the wall , we assume that it corresponds to a representative value of the convective velocity . 
 the normalized convective velocity @xmath118 was scaled by the shaking parameter @xmath119 and the dimensionless system size @xmath108 . 
 the obtained scaling ( eq  ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) ) indicates that the representative convective velocity can be written as a certain power - law product of the vibrational velocity @xmath105 , the gravitational velocity @xmath104 , and the dimensionless system size @xmath86 . 
 this experimentally obtained scaling law is qualitatively consistent with other previous studies of granular convection or bne . using the scaling law 
 , one can roughly estimate the convective velocity for various vibrational conditions , in principle . since the gravitational acceleration and frictional properties 
 are not varied in this experiment , applicability of the current result toward actual regolith migration might be still limited . 
 systematic further studies have to be carried out to unveil the regolith migration dynamics owing to the granular convection .

94,"m. kac s classical paper  can one hear the shape of a drum "" @xcite , triggered intensive research in two complementary aspects of this problem . on the one hand , 
 a search for systems for which kac s question is answered in the affirmative was conducted , and , on the other hand , various examples of pairs of systems which are isospectral but not isometric were identified . in the present paper 
 we shall focus our attention to quantum graphs and in the following lines will review the subject of isospectrality in this limited context . 
 the interested reader is referred to [ 1 - 11 ] for a broader view of the field where spectral inversion and its uniqueness are discussed . 
 spectral problems related to graphs emerge in two distinct ways . in the first , the spectrum of the connectivity ( adjacency ) matrix is considered . 
 it represents a discrete version of the laplacian , and for finite graphs , the spectrum is finite . 
 this set of problems is often referred to as combinatorial graphs . 
 quantum ( metric ) graphs are obtained by associating the standard metric to the bonds which connect the vertices . 
 the schrdinger operator consists of the one - dimensional laplacians on the bonds complemented by appropriate boundary conditions at the vertices ( see next section ) . 
 the spectrum of quantum graphs is unbounded , and it displays many interesting features which made it a convenient paradigm in the study of quantum chaos @xcite .    shortly after the appearance of kac s paper , m. e. fisher published his work  on hearing the shape of a drum "" @xcite , where he addresses isospectrality for the discrete version of the laplacian . 
 since then , the study of isospectral combinatorial graphs made very impressive progress . 
 in particular , several methods to construct isospectral yet different graphs were proposed . 
 a review of this problem can be found in @xcite . in particular , a method which was originally put forward by sunada @xcite to construct isospectral laplace - beltrami operators on riemann manifolds , was adapted for the corresponding problem in the context of combinatorial graphs . here 
 we shall go one step further , and show that it can be also adapted for quantum graphs . 
 the conditions under which the spectral inversion of quantum graphs is unique were studied previously . in @xcite 
 it was shown that in general , the spectrum does not determine uniquely the length of the bonds and their connectivity . 
 however , it was shown in @xcite that quantum graphs whose bond lengths are _ rationally independent _  can be heard "" - that is - their spectra determine uniquely their connectivity matrices and their bond lengths . 
 this fact follows from the existence of an exact trace formula for quantum graphs @xcite . 
 thus , isospectral pairs of non congruent graphs , must have rationally dependent bond lengths . 
 the sunada method , which is based on constructing the isospectral domains by concatenating several copies of a given building block , automatically provides us with graphs with rationally dependent lengths . 
 an example of a pair of metrically distinct graphs which share the same spectrum was already discussed in @xcite . in a previous report 
 we have shown that all the known isospectral domains in @xmath0 @xcite have corresponding isospectral pairs of quantum graphs @xcite . here , we shall take the subject one step further , and propose that isospectral graphs can be resolved by counting their nodal domains . 
 that is , the nodal counts of eigenfunctions belonging to the same spectral value are not the same . 
 the idea that nodal counts resolve isospectrality was suggested in @xcite for a family of isospectral flat tori in 4-d , and was tested numerically . the present work offers both rigorous and numerical evidence to substantiate the validity of this conjecture in a few examples of isospectral graphs . for these examples 
 the nodal counts differences ocur on a substantial fraction of the spectrum . 
 the paper is organized in the following way . 
 for the sake of completeness we shall give a short review of some elementary definitions and facts on quantum graphs . 
 we shall then show how pairs of isospectral domains in @xmath0 can be reduced to isospectral pairs of quantum graphs , and discuss their spectra and eigenfunctions . 
 finally , we shall study the nodal domains of these eigenfunctions and show that by counting nodal domains one can resolve the isospectral ambiguity of the graphs presented . 
 we consider finite graphs consisting of @xmath1 _ vertices _ connected by @xmath2 _ 
 bonds_. the @xmath3 _ connectivity matrix _ will be denoted by @xmath4 : @xmath5 when the vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7 are connected by @xmath8 bonds , and it vanishes otherwise . 
 the group of bonds which emerge from the vertex @xmath6 form a  star "" which will be denoted by @xmath9 . 
 @xmath10 of a vertex is defined as the cardinality of the star @xmath9 and @xmath11 . 
 vertices with @xmath12 belong to the graph _ 
 boundary_. the vertices with @xmath13 belong to the graph _ interior_. the bonds are endowed with the standard metric , and the coordinates along the bonds @xmath14 are denoted by @xmath15 . the length of the bonds will be denoted by @xmath16 , and the total length of the graph is @xmath17 . 
 the domain of the schrdinger operator on the graph is the space of functions which belong to sobolev space @xmath18 on each bond b and at the vertices they are continuous and obey boundary conditions as is mentioned in ( [ eq : bc ] ) . 
 the operator is constructed in the following way . 
 on the bonds , it is identified as the laplacian in 1-d @xmath19 . 
 it is supplemented by boundary conditions on the vertices which ensure that the resulting operator is self adjoint . 
 we shall consider in this paper the neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions : @xmath20 the derivatives in ( [ eq : bc ] ) are directed out of the vertex @xmath6 . 
 _ comment _ : the neumann boundary conditions will be assumed throughout , unless otherwise stated . 
 a wave function with a wave number @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath14 connects the vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where the wave function @xmath23 takes the values @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively . 
 the form ( [ eq : wavefun ] ) ensures continuity . 
 the spectrum @xmath26 and the corresponding eigenfunctions are determined by substituting ( [ eq : wavefun ] ) in ( [ eq : bc ] ) . 
 the resulting homogeneous linear equations for the @xmath24 are written as @xmath27 and a non trivial solution exists when @xmath28 the spectrum @xmath29 , which is a discrete , positive and unbounded sequence is the zero set of the _ secular function _ @xmath30 . 
 the secular functions of the type ( [ eq : secular ] ) have poles on the real @xmath21 axis , which renders them rather inconvenient for numerical studies . 
 the secular function can be easily regularized in various ways , ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 it is easy to show that the complete wave function can be written down in terms of the vertex wave functions at the interior vertices with @xmath31 only . in the sequel 
 we shall denote their number by @xmath32 . 
 this reduces the dimension of the matrix @xmath33 above from @xmath1 to @xmath32 . 
 the nodal domains of the eigenfunctions ( the connected domains where the wave function is of constant sign ) , are of two types . 
 the ones that are confined to a single bond are rather trivial . 
 their length is exactly half a wavelength and their number is on average @xmath34 . 
 the nodal domains which extend over several bonds emanating from a single vertex vary in length and their existence is the reason why counting nodal domains on graphs is not a trivial task . 
 the number of nodal domains in a general graph can be written as @xmath35\mathrm{sign}[\phi_j ]    \right ) \right   \ }   -b + v \ . 
 \label{eq : nnb2}\ ] ] where @xmath36 stands for the largest integer which is smaller than @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are the values of the eigenfunction at the vertices connected by the bond @xmath14 @xcite . 
 ( [ eq : nnb2 ] ) holds for the case of an eigenfunction which does not vanish on any vertex : @xmath39 . 
 recently schapotschnikow @xcite proved that sturm s oscillation theorem extends to finite tree ( loop - less ) graphs : 
 the number of nodal domains of the @xmath40th eigenfunction ( ordered by increasing eigenvalues ) is @xmath40 . 
 berkolaiko @xcite have shown that the number of nodal domains is bounded to the interval @xmath41 $ ] where @xmath42 is the minimal number of bonds which should be cut so that the resulting graph is a tree . 
 nodal domains can be also defined and counted in an alternative way which makes use of the vertex wave functions @xmath43 ( see ( [ eq : wavefun ] ) ) exclusively :    _ a nodal domain consists of a maximal set of connected interior vertices ( @xmath31 ) _     _ where the vertex wave functions have the same sign . 
 _    this definition has to be modified if any of the @xmath24 vanishes . 
 then , the sign attributed to it is chosen to maximize the number of nodal domains @xcite . 
 we thus have two independent ways to define and count nodal domains . to distinguish between them 
 we shall refer to the first as _ metric _ nodal domains , and the number of metric domains in the @xmath40th eigenfunction will be denoted by @xmath44 . 
 berkolaiko s theorem states that @xmath45 . 
 the domains defined in terms of the vertex wave functions will be referred to as the _ discrete _ nodal domains . 
 the number of discrete nodal domains of the @xmath40th vertex wave function will be denoted by @xmath46 . 
 the sequences of metric and discrete nodal domains counts @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the main objects of study of the present paper . 
 the first pair of isospectral planar domains which was introduced by gordon , web and wolpert @xcite is a member of a much larger set which was discussed in @xcite . 
 this was extended in @xcite to include domains which differ in the distribution of boundary conditions ( dirichlet or neumann ) along their boundaries . 
 the common feature of these sets of pairs of isospectral domains is that they are constructed using the sunada method @xcite , and they share a few important and distinctive attributes :    * the domains are constructed by concatenating an elementary  building block "" in two different prescribed ways to form the two domains . 
 a building block is joined to another by reflecting along the common boundary . 
 the shape of the building block is constrained only by symmetry requirements , but otherwise it is quite general . * 
 the eigenfunctions corresponding to the same eigenvalue are related to each other by a _ 
 transplantation_. that is , the eigenfunction in a building block of one domain can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenfunction in several building blocks in the other domain . 
 the transplantation matrix is independent of the considered eigenvalue . * the construction of these pairs reflects an abstract algebraic structure which was identified by sunada @xcite . 
 an example of an isospectral pair of domains in @xmath49 and its building block is given in figure ( [ fig:7 - 3](a ) ) . 
 this is a pair whose construction is described in @xcite . 
 it is denoted there by @xmath50 . 
 other examples are displayed in e.g. , @xcite . 
 we can construct _ metric _ graphs which are analogous to these domains , by replacing the building blocks by appropriate graphs which preserve the requires symmetry . 
 as an example , the triangular building block in figure ( [ fig:7 - 3](a ) ) can be replaced by a 3 - star with bonds of lengths @xmath51 , @xmath14 and @xmath52 as shown in figure ( [ fig:7 - 3](b ) ) . 
 this yields the pair of isospectral but non isometric graphs shown in figure ( [ fig:7 - 3](c ) ) . 
 ( in drawing figure ( [ fig:7 - 3](c ) ) we took advantage of the fact that the  angles "" between the bonds are insignificant ) . 
 note that the two graphs share the same connectivity matrix ( they are topologically congruent ) however they are not isometric . as a matter of fact the right and the left graphs are interchanged when the bonds  @xmath14 "" with 
 @xmath52 "" are switched . 
 thus , the lengths @xmath14 and @xmath52 must be different to ensure that the two graphs are not isometric . 
 this is an example of an asymmetry requirement which the building block must satisfy . 
 all other pairs of isospectral domains proposed in @xcite can be converted to their analogous quantum graphs ( see @xcite for details ) . 
 two examples are shown in figure ( [ fig:13 - 3and13 - 8 ] ) . 
 the most simple pair of isospectral domains can be built by applying the sunada method to the dihedral group @xmath53 . 
 the resulting graphs are shown in figure ( [ fig : isospectral pair+notations ] ) , where the letters @xmath54 or @xmath55 specify the boundary conditions at the boundary vertices . 
 ( the boundary conditions at the interior vertices are always neumann ) . 
 note that the two graphs are connected differently , in contrast with the previous example where the topology of the two graphs is the same . in [ appendix1 ] we give a brief description of the construction of this pair , as an example of the sunada method .    in a way of illustration 
 we shall write explicitly the secular functions for the graphs shown above . 
 starting with the @xmath50 pair , we have @xmath56 ( the interior vertices are marked by a black dot and are enumerated in figure 1(c ) ) . the secular function for the graph @xmath57 
 is written in terms of the matrix @xmath58 here , @xmath59 and @xmath60 the corresponding vertex eigenfunction @xmath61 is the eigenvector of @xmath62 with a vanishing eigenvalue . 
 the @xmath33 matrix for the graph @xmath63 is obtained from the matrix @xmath64 by interchanging @xmath52 and @xmath14 . 
 explicit computation shows that @xmath65 . 
 this proves the isospectrality of the two graphs . 
 the sum of the elements of any of the columns of @xmath66 is @xmath67 . 
 hence the vector @xmath68 is an eigenvector with an eigenvalue @xmath67 . 
 the values of @xmath21 for which @xmath69 are in the spectrum of both graphs . 
 they correspond to eigenfunctions which are the same on each of the 3-stars - the building block of the complete graphs ( figure 1(b ) ) . as a matter of fact 
 , the condition @xmath69 is the secular equation for this 3-star with bond lengths @xmath70 @xcite . 
 this subset exhausts 1/7 of the spectrum of the graphs , and in this set the transplantation property is trivial . 
 the transplantation property which is basic to the proof of isospectrality for the @xmath49 domains in @xcite can be explicitly formulated by the transplantation matrix     @xmath71 we observe that the inverse transplantation is also effected by @xmath72 : @xmath73 even though @xmath72 is not self inversive . 
 the fact that @xmath72 induces the transplantation in the two directions , implies that the vertex wave functions @xmath74 must be eigenvectors of @xmath75 ( as long as the eigenvalue is not degenerate ) . 
 the wave functions are defined up to normalization , and therefore the corresponding eigenvalues can be different than unity . 
 the spectrum of @xmath75 consists of the eigenvalue @xmath76 and the six - fold degenerate eigenvalue @xmath77 . 
 thus , the vertex wave functions are either proportional to @xmath78 , or belong to the 6 dimensional subspace of vectors orthogonal to @xmath78 . 
 this observation will be used in the next section when the nodal structure of the eigenfunctions is to be discussed . 
 other examples of pairs of isospectral graphs such as e.g. , the pair described in @xcite can be obtained from the isospectral graphs constructed above , by setting the length of the @xmath52 bond to zero . 
 this was explicitly shown in @xcite . 
 using similar special cases one can generate a rich variety of isospectral but not isometric quantum graphs . 
 finally , it should be emphasized , that the skeleton of interior vertices form graphs which are identical to the topological , colored graphs which were introduced in @xcite to express the transplantation properties of the isospectral domains in @xmath49 . 
 the quantum , metric graphs can be obtained simply by completing each topological vertex to a 3-vertex star graph with lengths @xmath70 . 
 topological bonds are associated with lengths according to their colors , and bonds are added to the topological vertices with valency less than three , to complete them to 3- stars . 
 this proves the statement made above that the computation carried out here can be repeated for any of the topological graphs shown in @xcite . 
 the graphs corresponding to the isospectral domains @xmath79 and @xmath80 are shown in figure [ fig:13 - 3and13 - 8 ] . 
 + i ii    the dihedral graphs are much simpler , with @xmath81 . 
 their secular determinants can be shown to be identical functions of @xmath21 . 
 this is an explicit demonstration that the graphs are indeed isospectral . 
 the secular equation is obtained from @xmath82 as can be easily seen , @xmath83 has poles , and to get a regular secular function we have to multiply it by @xmath84 . 
 it takes the form @xmath85    the transplantation matrix for this pair of graphs is derived in [ appendix1 ] . 
 it reads @xmath86 the eigenvectors @xmath87 point at the directions @xmath88 , with @xmath89 . 
 the transplantation ( [ eq : transdi ] ) implies that @xmath90 is obtained from @xmath91 by a rotation of @xmath92 counterclockwise . 
 direct substitutions shows that @xmath93 where , @xmath94    the explicit form of the functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 will be used in the discussion of nodal counting in the next section . 
 the real eigenfunctions of laplace - beltrami operators on two dimensional manifolds display usually an intricate sets of nodal domains - which are the connected domains where the sign of the eigenfunction is constant @xcite . 
 sturm s oscillation theorem for systems in 1-d , and its extension by courant to any dimension , establish the connection between the number of nodal domains and the spectrum : the number of nodal domains @xmath44 of the @xmath40th eigenfunction is bounded by @xmath40 . 
 ( the eigenfunctions are arranged by increasing value of their eigenvalues ) . 
 theorem for combinatorial graphs and for quantum graphs were proved in @xcite , respectively .    given a pair of isospectral domains . 
 are the sequences of nodal counts @xmath97 identical ? 
 in other words , can one use the information stored in the nodal sequences to resolve isospectrality ? 
 this question was recently discussed in the context of isospectral flat tori in @xmath98 with @xmath99 @xcite , and numerical as well as analytical evidence was brought to substantiate the conjecture that the nodal sequences resolve isospectrality . in this section we shall provide rigorous as well as numerical evidence to show that the same is true for isospectral quantum graphs of the types discussed above . 
 we shall start by discussing the _ discrete _ nodal sequences and then proceed to the _ metric _ nodal sequences . 
 the _ discrete _ nodal domains were defined as the maximally connected sets of interior vertices with vertex wave functions of equal sign . 
 their number is denoted by @xmath46 , and the nodal sequence is @xmath100 . 
 we shall prove in the next subsection that for the dihedral graphs half of the entries in the sequences of discrete nodal counts are different . 
 we are not able to provide a similar proof for the more complex graphs , but we shall bring numerical evidence which supports the conjecture that their sequences of discrete nodal counts are different 
 .      the number of discrete nodal domains for this pair of dihedral graphs ( see figure [ fig : isospectral pair+notations ] ) can be either one or two , depending on whether the signs of the components of the ( two dimensional ) vertex eigenfunctions have the same sign or not . 
 in other words ( see ( [ eq : tan ] ) ) , the number of nodal domains depend on the quadrant in the @xmath101 plane where the eigenvectors point : @xmath102 in the first and the third quadrants , and @xmath103 in the second and the fourth quadrants : @xmath104 the transplantation implies that the eigenvectors @xmath105 are obtained by rotating @xmath106 by @xmath92 counterclockwise 
 . therefore , @xmath107 if the transplantation rotates the vectors across the quadrant borders . in other words , @xmath108 this observation is essential to our discussion since it expresses the problem of nodal counting in geometrical terms . 
 it is convenient to construct finite subsequences @xmath109 and @xmath110 of discrete nodal count of graphs i and ii , restricted to the spectral points in the interval @xmath111 . 
 we denote the number of terms by @xmath112 . 
 define @xmath113 we shall now prove    [ thm1 ] consider the dihedral graphs i , ii discussed above with rationally independent bond lengths @xmath70 . then @xmath114    _ proof of theorem [ thm1 ] : _ the rational independence of @xmath70 implies that the eigenfunctions never vanish on the inner vertices and hence that the spectrum is simple .    in order to study @xmath115 above 
 , we consider the distribution of the directions of the eigenfunctions @xmath116 in the spectral interval . using ( [ eq : secdireg],[eq : tan ] , [ eq : gfunction ] ) we get @xmath117 in taking the limit @xmath118 we use @xmath119 @xcite . moreover , since @xmath70 are assumed to be rationally independent , @xmath21 creates an ergodic flow on the 3-torus @xmath120 spanned by @xmath121 . 
 ergodicity implies that the integral over @xmath21 in ( [ eq : ndist1 ] ) may be replaced by an integral over @xmath120 leading to @xmath122 \label{eq : ndist2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] now we note that under the transformation @xmath123 we have @xmath124    thus , we conclude that @xmath125      at this stage we are not able to prove the validity of the conjecture that the nodal sequences resolve the isospectrality of the graphs @xmath50 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . 
 however , numerical tests show that for an appreciable fraction of the wave functions , the nodal counts are distinct 
 . we shall start the discussion by considering the case @xmath50 , for which we can turn the counting problem into a geometrical problem . 
 the vertex wave functions which correspond to the same eigenvalues are related by transplantation : @xmath126 where @xmath74 stand now for the vertex wave function restricted to the 7 interior vertices in these graphs . 
 we have already shown that eigenvectors @xmath127 are either proportional to @xmath128 ( the vector with constant entries)- in which case both have a single nodal domain , and @xmath129 , or the @xmath127 are orthogonal to @xmath128 . 
 the 6 eigenvectors of @xmath75 with eigenvalue @xmath77 span the orthogonal subspace : three of them correspond to the eigenvalue @xmath130 of @xmath72 , and the other three correspond to the eigenvalue @xmath131 of @xmath72 . any vertex wave function @xmath132 which is not proportional to @xmath128 , can be written as @xmath133 where @xmath134 stand for arbitrary normalized vectors in the three dimensional subspaces mention above , and @xmath135 $ ] . 
 thus , latexmath:[\[\vec{\phi}^{\ ii } = t \vec{\phi}^{\ i } = \sqrt2 ( \cos\alpha \    difference in nodal numbers comes only through the change of sign of the linear combination . 
 we are not able to make further progress beyond this point , and we shall therefore summarize the numerical findings .    _ the graph _ @xmath50 - based on the study of approximately 6600 eigenfunctions we find that the difference between the discrete nodal counts can take the values @xmath137 only . 
 the nodal counts are different for @xmath138 19 @xmath139 of the wave - functions .    _ the graph _ @xmath79 - based on the study of approximately 2000 eigenfunctions we find that the difference between the discrete nodal counts can take the values @xmath137 only . 
 the nodal counts are different for @xmath138 22@xmath139 of the wave - functions .    _ 
 the graph _ @xmath80 - based on the study of approximately 4700 eigenfunctions we find that the difference between the discrete nodal counts can take the values @xmath140 only . 
 the nodal counts are different for @xmath138 22 @xmath139 of the wave - functions . 
 this result is certainly encouraging but not sufficient , and we are trying various options to substantiate it more rigourously .      the discussion of the metric nodal sequences is facilitated in the present examples of isospectral graphs since most of them are trees . 
 then , by making use of schapotschnikow s theorem @xcite , the _ metric _ nodal counts @xmath141 . 
 this applies in particular to the isospectral graphs of the types @xmath50 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 which are tree graphs and @xmath142 . 
 the metric counts do not resolve the isospectrality in these case . 
 however , less trivially connected graphs can be constructed by replacing the basic building block . for such graphs schapotschnikow s theorem does not apply , and we expect their metric sequences to be different . 
 below we shall show that this is true for the pair of dihedral graph where graph ii is not a tree . 
 consider the pair of dihedral graphs , and let @xmath143 denote the metric nodal counts of graphs i and and ii . using ( [ eq : nnb2 ] ) we express the difference @xmath144 as @xmath145\nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] to obtain ( [ eq : nd_diff ] ) a slight modification of ( [ eq : nnb2 ] ) was needed : the term in the sum that corresponds to a bond with boundary vertex that has dirichlet boundary conditions should be modified to be @xmath146 instead of @xmath147\mathrm{sign}[\phi_j ]    \right ) $ ] . 
 in addition while deriving ( [ eq : nd_diff ] ) we made use of the identity @xmath148 and of the freedom to choose the sign of the first component of the wave - functions to be positive . 
 a theorem by berkolaiko @xcite guarantees that @xmath149 can only take the values @xmath150 and @xmath151 . 
 we would like to compute the distribution of these values on the spectrum . 
 for this purpose we consider the spectral interval @xmath152 and study the function @xmath153 and prove the following theorem . 
 [ theorem1]theorem    [ thm2 ] consider the dihedral graphs i , ii discussed above with rationally independent bond lengths @xmath70 . then @xmath154    _ proof of theorem [ thm2 ] : _ in order to study the @xmath155 above we consider the distribution of @xmath149 , which is given by the integral @xmath156 where the spectral secular function @xmath95 is defined in ( [ eq : secdireg ] ) above , and @xmath157 coincides with @xmath149 for @xmath158 and can be written explicitly as @xmath159 \ .\end{aligned}\ ] ] following the same route as in the proof of theorem ( [ thm1 ] ) we take the limit @xmath118 while making use of the ergodic theorem , and replace the @xmath21 integration by an integration over the 3 - torus with coordinates @xmath160 . 
 @xmath161 the last line follows from the fact that @xmath37 is an integer which is written as half the sum of four unimodular numbers . 
 next we note that under the transformation @xmath162 we have @xmath163 thus , we conclude that @xmath164 . 
 but due to berkolaiko s theorem @xcite @xmath165 . 
 therefore , @xmath166 
 there is now a growing amount of evidence that nodal - count sequences store information on the geometry of the system under study , which is similar but not equivalent to the information stored in the spectral sequence . in a recent paper @xcite 
 it was shown that the nodal count sequence for separable laplace - beltrami operators can be expressed in terms of a trace formula which consists of a smooth ( weyl - like ) part , and an oscillatory part . 
 the smooth part depends on constants which can be derived from the geometry of the domain , and the oscillatory part depends on the classical periodic orbits , much in the same way as the spectral trace formula . however , what we have shown in the present paper is that the information stored in the two sequences is not identical : for the isospectral pairs of graphs considered here , the nodal - count sequences are different in a substantial way . in this respect , 
 the nodal sequence resolves isospectrality . 
 till this work was done , the conjecture that isospectrality is resolved by counting nodal domains was substantiated by numerical studies only . 
 here we presented for the first time a system where this fact is proved rigorously . the main breakthrough which enabled the proof was by formulating the counting problem in a geometrical setting . 
 we hope that this way will pave the way to further analytical studies , where more complex systems will be dealt with . 
 finally , we would like to mention a set of open problems which naturally arise in the present context : can one find metrically different domains where the laplacians have different spectra but the nodal counting sequences are the same ? a positive answer is provided for domains in @xmath151 dimension ( sturm ) or for tree graphs ( schapotschnikow ) . 
 are there other less trivial examples ?

 the dihedral group @xmath167 is the symmetry group of a square . 
 let @xmath51 be the transformation of rotating the square @xmath168 counterclockwise and b be the transformation of reflecting it along the x axis . 
 the dihedral group is generated by @xmath169 which obey @xmath170,@xmath171 . 
 the 8 group elements of @xmath172 are @xmath173 . 
 @xmath174 are reflections along the axis @xmath175 respectively ( figure [ fig : basic square ] ) . 
 note that the multiplication should be read from right to left since the elements are transformations . 
 this group has 5 irreducible representations ( irreps ) . 
 four of them are one dimensional and one , which is of our interest , is two dimensional . 
 the two dimensional representation is :        denote the second basis by @xmath181 . 
 so that @xmath182 . notice that in the first form of the representation @xmath183 and @xmath184 are diagonal and in the second one @xmath185 and @xmath186 are diagonal . 
 this will be exploited soon . 
 the graph in figure [ fig : complete graph](a ) obeys the dihedral symmetry . 
 examine the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger operator with neumann boundary conditions on all the vertices . 
 the set of all the eigenfuncions of a certain eigenvalue @xmath187 form a finite dimensional vector space @xmath1 with some dimension @xmath188 . 
 this vector space is invariant under the action of the dihedral group and therefore @xmath1 is the carrier space of some representation of @xmath172 . 
 we are interested in the case that this representation is the two dimensional irrep of @xmath189 or that this representation is a reducible representation that contains the two dimensional irrep . 
 consider the basis @xmath177 of this 2d irrep ( note that now @xmath190 have the meaning of wave functions on the graph in figure [ fig : complete graph ] ) . from the matrix which corresponds to @xmath183 in this basis ( see ( [ eq : repform1 ] ) ) we deduce that @xmath191 vanish on the axis x ( as an odd function with respect to that axis ) and as for @xmath192 , its derivative vanishes on the x axis ( since @xmath193 is an even function with respect to that axis and therefore its derivative is odd ) . 
 using the notation from figure [ fig : complete graph](b ) , we have :       + similarly , examining the matrix of @xmath184 in this basis ( [ eq : repform1 ] ) yields @xmath195 + we can get similar observations by looking on the matrices of @xmath185 , @xmath186 , this time for the basis @xmath196 ( [ eq : repform2 ] ) . 
 we get the following @xmath197 + now , a pair of isospectral graphs will be constructed out of the complete graph . 
 each of the graphs in the pair will be a subgraph of the complete graph . 
 graph i is the graph that consists of the vertices b , c , d , e , f and all the bonds which connect them . 
 graph ii is the graph that consists of the vertices a , b , c , d and all the bonds which connect them ( figure [ fig : boundary conditions ] ) . 
 we can define the subgraphs in another way which will become convenient later : using the axis @xmath198 as in figure [ fig : basic square ] we define two sets of coordinates @xmath199 and @xmath200 and use them to examine the complete graph . 
 graph i is obtained when restricting ourselves to the region @xmath201 of the complete graph . 
 graph ii is obtained when restricting to the region @xmath202 . for a certain eigenvalue @xmath187 of the complete graph 
 whose representation contains the 2d irrep discussed before , we can define appropriate eigenfunctions on the two subgraphs by @xmath203 . 
 the boundary conditions of @xmath204 are obtained from ( [ eq : bndcnds1.1]),([eq : bndcnds1.2]),([eq : bndcnds2.1 ] ) , ( [ eq : bndcnds2.2 ] ) and are shown in figure [ fig : boundary conditions ] . 
 _ proof of theorem [ thm3 ] : _ we will make use of the results above in order to construct a transplantation which proves the theorem . 
 let @xmath208 . 
 denote by @xmath209 the space of eigenfunctions which belong to the eigenvalue @xmath187 . 
 @xmath210 define the functions @xmath211 on the complete graph by the following : @xmath212 where we have used again the coordinates @xmath213 as defined trivially by the axis @xmath214 ( scaling is obviously not important for our purposes ) . 
 it can be verified that @xmath191 , @xmath192 are valid eigenfunctions of the eigenvalue @xmath187 defined on the complete graph . 
 if @xmath215 for some @xmath216 then we get that @xmath217 ( this can simply be concluded by considering the boundary conditions ) . therefore @xmath211 are independent eigenfunctions and form a basis @xmath218 for the appropriate eigenspace . 
 this is exactly the basis @xmath219 of the first form of the 2d irrep of @xmath220 ( see [ eq : repform1 ] ) . 
 ( this can be verified for example by examining the representation of the generators @xmath221 of @xmath220 ) . 
 now , we construct the basis @xmath222 by @xmath223 . and now define the function @xmath224 on graph ii by @xmath225 . 
 we get that @xmath224 is an eigenfunction of graph ii which belongs to the eigenvalue @xmath187 and obeys the appropriate boundary conditions @xmath226 .    following this procedure 
 , one can verify that @xmath72 is the transplantation matrix of the vertex wave functions . 
 we can similarly describe the inverse transplantation . 
 the inverse transplantation is linear and therefore if we have an independent set of eigenfunctions ( with the same eigenvalue ) they would remain independent after the transplantation . thus , the degeneracies of @xmath187 in @xmath227 and @xmath228 are equal . 
 the existence of the inverse transplantation also proves that @xmath229 and the degeneracy is again the same . 
 therefore @xmath230 with account of multiplicities.@xmath231","we present and discuss isospectral quantum graphs which are not isometric .

95,"the ongoing heavy ion physics program with the star detector at rhic has accumulated the wealth of experimental data , stimulating important advances in the understanding of properties of hot strongly interacting matter @xcite . 
 some of the focus areas currently under study are the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of the matter created , in - medium effects on parton propagation , and hadronization mechanisms in qcd matter . 
 uniform azimuthal acceptance and extended pseudo - rapidity coverage of the star detector is exceptionally suited for studies of jets and jet - medium interactions via triggered and non - triggered correlations . 
 the data provided quantitative constrains on jet fragmentation and theoretical models of energy loss . 
 systematic studies of medium effects are advanced by analysis of system size effects on tomographic probes . 
 data collected with lighter cu ions have expanded those studies by providing additional control over the system size variations . 
 complimentary data samples at lower beam energy of 62 gev have also allowed systematic studies as function of energy to be performed . 
 star full capabilities for particle identification in a wide kinematic range have enabled new advances in more quantitative tests of qcd predictions . 
 different detectors provide complimentary capabilities and coverage . 
 pions , kaons , electrons and ( anti)protons are identified via their specific ionization energy loss in the time - projection chamber ( tpc ) material at low and high transverse momenta ( @xmath0 ) . in the intermediate momentum range 
 tpc results are enhanced by the time - of - flight ( tof ) capabilities . 
 muons can be identified in the muon telescope detector ( mtd ) prototype . 
 photons at forward rapidities are measured using the photon multiplicity detector ( pmd ) . 
 weakly decaying strange and multi - strange hadrons are identified geometrically by their decay vertices with the tpc and tof information on decay daughter particles . 
 short - lived resonances are reconstructed combinatorially by the invariant mass technique . 
 these capabilities have allowed measuring the yields and transverse momentum spectra addressing a variety of physics topics , including strangeness and heavy flavor production that are of topical interest for this conference . 
 strangeness enhancement was long thought as one of the signatures for the quark - gluon plasma formation @xcite . 
 early data suggested that strangeness equilibration is achieved at rhic and that initial collision geometry affects the strangeness systematics . in star studies of the collision geometry effects on strangeness production 
 is being accomplished by comprehensive analysis of various strange species ( @xmath1,@xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) in light vs. heavy systems at all rhic energies . the latest update on those developments 
 is reported in @xcite . 
 new advances in heavy flavor sector afforded by star particle identification capabilities include the measurements of j/@xmath7 spectra and nuclear modification factors in cu+cu collisions , measurements of charm total cross - section for @xmath8 , d+au , au+au and cu+cu systems , new constrains on bottom contribution to heavy flavor from j/@xmath7-hadron and @xmath9-@xmath10 azimuthal correlation studies . 
 these and other highlights on heavy quark measurements from star are reported in @xcite . 
 the following two sections will focus on some of the new results from triggered and non - triggered correlation analyses . 
 elliptic flow results have produced a lot of excitement from the beginning of rhic program . 
 for the first time in heavy ion collisions the large @xmath11 values reported could be described by ideal hydrodynamics  @xcite . 
 theoretical calculations successful in description of flow results indicated the values of the shear viscosity over the entropy ratio consistent with the expectations for strongly interacting medium  @xcite . 
 although recent work seem to question the applicability of ideal hydro  @xcite , most theories agree that the matter created at rhic is extremely dense , with the hydrodynamic description applicability limits extending to higher @xmath0 for more central collisions . 
 flow results provide strong indications for partonic nature of the medium : constituent quark scaling observed for all measured hadron species ( including @xmath6 and @xmath5 with their small hadronic interaction cross - sections ) points on relevance of partonic degrees of freedom at hadronization  @xcite . 
 similar results are observed in the cu+cu collisions although the overall @xmath11 values are lower at a given centrality for the cu+cu compared to au+au at the same energy . 
 new result reported recently by star on non - triggered two - particle correlations provide independent means to extract and cross - check azimuthal anisotropy parameters , but also to characterize other processes that induce relative angular correlations between the particles pairs . in this analysis di - hadron correlation formed with no transverse momentum restrictions on either hadron 
 is used to study centrality evolution of characteristic structures in relative azimuth and pseudo - rapidity . 
 it has been shown that the resulting correlation can be decomposed into a few structures , and information related to the individual sources can be extracted  @xcite . per - particle 
 pair densities for various centrality bins of 200  gev minimum bias au+au data sample are shown in figure 1 . 
 minijet contribution , measured as the same - side two - dimensional gaussian correlation structure , was found to exhibit a threshold behavior . 
 while approximate binary scaling is observed from @xmath8 and most peripheral au+au to mid - central collisions , a sharp transition is found for both 200 and 62 gev au+au data at about 55% and 40% event centrality , respectively . as shown in figure 2 , from this point 
 the minijet peak amplitude exhibits rapid growth and the peak width in relative pseudo - rapidity broadens by more than a factor of 2 . here 
 the transverse density , calculated as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is initial collision overlap area s from glauber model , is used as a centrality measure . 
 also shown in figure 2 is the total yield or `` volume '' of the minijet peak . 
 it is estimated to include approximately one third of all produced particles in central collisions . 
 novel features have been also observed by star in the triggered correlations . 
 early results on the disappearance of away - side jet ( in certain kinematic range ) unambiguously established the presence of the jet quenching phenomena at rhic @xcite . 
 experimental observations are found to be consistent with theoretical expectations for partonic energy loss @xcite , prompting more studies of the mechanisms of jet - medium interactions . 
 two - dimensional study of the correlation structures for charged hadrons associated with a high-@xmath0 trigger shows shape modifications in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 dimensions compared to a @xmath8 reference . within a two - component approach the intermediate @xmath0 structure 
 can be decomposed into a jet - like part , and the so - called `` ridge '' . 
 the jet part appears similar in shape to the structures seen in @xmath8 data , while `` ridge '' resembles properties of the bulk medium . 
 left panel of figure 3 illustrates the ridge - long range @xmath15 structure accompanying the jet peak in central 200 gev au+au collisions@xcite . 
 jet - medium interaction is likely to be the origin of the ridge formation and modification of the jet - like peaks . 
 di - hadron correlations with identified hadrons provide additional means to study parton propagation in the medium . 
 measurements of identified particle spectra and ratios for associated hadrons in the jet cones and ridges could address the issues of color - charge dependence of energy loss , presence of meson / baryon effects and interplay between various hadronization scenarios . 
 strong enhancement of baryon production at intermediate momentum range in inclusive measurements was theorized as an evidence for quark coalescence . however , in azimuthal correlations with the hyperon - triggers significant jet - like structures were observed for all species of hyperons ( including @xmath6 )  @xcite , which contradicts initial expectations from coalescence picture . 
 associated hadron yields in ( multi)strange hadron correlations show no dependence on strangeness content . following those observations , a medium response to the propagating parton or `` phantom jet '' was proposed to accommodate the data within the coalescence picture  @xcite . 
 this theoretical explanation preserves the correlation in azimuthal space and produces ridge - like structure in pseudo - rapidity . to confront the models and further the understanding of physics mechanisms producing the ridge , it was essential to extend the correlation studies into @xmath15-@xmath14 space separately for baryons and mesons . 
 preliminary star results show significant differences in strange ( central panel of figure 3 ) and non - strange ( figure 3 , right ) baryon to meson ratios measured in jet part around a 4 gev/@xmath16 triggers , with respect to the ridge part . 
 the jet - part ratios for @xmath17 and @xmath18 are found to be significantly lower in central au+au collisions compared to non - triggered distributions , and are consistent with the inclusive ratios from 200 gev @xmath8 data  @xcite . at the same time 
 , the ridge ratios suggest relative baryon enhancement for both strange and non - strange species , which might be related to direct fragmentation of the gluons , radiated of the hard - scattered quark , or their subsequent recombination with the medium partons . 
 higher statistics a+a data samples , expected to be collected in future runs , are required to address ridge hadro - chemistry in more details .

 , title=""fig:"",height=120 ]    to add yet another dimension to the ridge studies , one can bring in additional particle to the correlation to explore internal structure of the observed peak . 
 preliminary results of three - particle triggered correlation analysis for unidentified hadrons are presented in figure 4 for minimum bias d+au , peripheral and central au+au collisions at 200 gev . 
 a jet - like peak is observed in all three correlations at small relative pseudo - rapidity values . 
 in addition , a uniform distribution of associated yields is observed in au+au collisions , particularly , for most central events . 
 this observation is quite puzzling for ridge phenomenology , contradicting to model predictions  @xcite . 
 specifically we note the absence of axial strips in the correlation structure . 
 axial strips in three - particle correlation should be formed by associate hadron pairs , in which one of the hadrons is coming from the cone - part , and the other one - from the ridge . 
 absence of these strips thus suggests complete decoupling of jet and ridge events . 
 albeit the current statistic limitations , these early results have already provided more stringent constraints on the interpretation of ridge formation . 
 full jet reconstruction could provide new means to measure the energy loss of propagating partons . 
 experimental techniques for such reconstruction have been successfully used in elementary collision experiments . 
 recently full jet reconstruction was attempted for the first time for heavy ion events  @xcite . 
 a combination of charged hadron measurements from the tpc and neutral energy measurements from electro - magnetic calorimeter were utilized in star for this analysis . 
 left panel of figure 5 depicts a 47  gev single jet from 20% central high - tower triggered ( ht ) au+au data of 200 gev . 
 the aim of this analysis is to quantify the jet energy loss by detailed studies of possible modification in the fragmentation functions due to quenching effects in au+au with respect to @xmath8 reference measurements . 
 preliminary results from this study are shown in the right panel of figure 5 , where fragmentation functions , defined as @xmath21 , are compared for two colliding systems . 
 no modification in the fragmentation functions in excess of 10 - 20% is observed within the uncertainties from utilizing the current jet finding algorithms and background subtraction procedures . 
 this preliminary conclusion depends heavily on the assumptions of pythia fragmentation , and could be additionally affected by the bias induced in the jet - sample by applying background - suppressing analysis cuts . 
 this work will be continued with the anticipated higher statistics au+au data in the coming years .

 new physics focus will soon be added to the existing experimental program at rhic  @xcite . 
 the compelling evidences gathered for the new form of matter created in heavy ion collisions , called for more explorations of the qcd phase diagram . 
 the phase diagram , defined in terms of temperature ( t ) with respect to the baryon chemical potential ( @xmath22 ) , is believed to contain a number of phase boundaries , including the one that separates qgp partonic degrees of freedom from the ordinary ( hadronic gas ) matter . 
 lattice qcd ( lqcd ) predicts that in zero-@xmath22 limit the phase transition occurs as a smooth cross - over , while at higher @xmath22 values it is expected to be a first order transition . a critical point ( cp ) 
 is expected on a phase diagram , marking the location where qgp phase transition will change from a cross - over to a first order transition . in the absence of analytical solution 
 various approximation techniques are used in the theoretical calculations , with variations of lattice spacing , assumptions of quark masses and flavors , etc  @xcite . 
 the resulting predictions with regard to the exact cp location vary considerably . in the coming years star 
 will engage in the beam energy scan program , continuing years of research at ags , sps , and rhic itself . to locate the critical point 
 the energy scan program will vary incident energies to achieve desirable variations of t and @xmath22 . 
 decreasing the center - of - mass energies leads to formation of colder matter with higher baryon potential , allowing one to move across the phase map . with the detailed scan star 
 will search for various cp signatures , as well as investigate the evolution of medium properties indicative of the non - hadronic matter . 
 novel phenomena , such as constituent quark scaling of the elliptic flow , hadron suppression at high-@xmath0 sigh signal the onset of deconfinment . from theory , 
 the divergences are expected for the baryon number and the net charge susceptibilities , as well as for the specific heat near the critical point . 
 such divergences might lead to large fluctuations in a number of physical parameters , including baryon number density , quark number , and charge , which could be observed experimentally in hadronic yields , net - charge and mean-@xmath0 fluctuations , as well as particle ratios ( @xmath23 , @xmath17 , etc ) . 
 previous experimental results might already provide some hints regarding the cp location . 
 one such example is the excitation function for the @xmath24 ratio , that shows a drastic change - over near the center - of - mass energy of 8 gev ( figure 6 ) . 
 it is suggested that the `` horn '' feature could be linked directly to the qcd phase transition  @xcite . 
 the rhic energy scan program will span a range of energies going slightly below that , covering a suggested region of ( t,@xmath22 ) values from most theoretical expectations . 
 star experiment is uniquely suited for the search armed not only by aforementioned pid capabilities , further enhanced by the completion of the full tof barrel , but also by full azimuthal coverage with large acceptance , which is essential for all fluctuation measurements . 
 the physics impact of fluctuation measurements , for example in mean-@xmath0 , has been already shown for the available rhic energies , providing essential baseline for the low energy scan .

 star symbols depict first results for mid - rapidity kaon to pion ratios from 9.2 gev au+au collisions.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the energy scan has essentially begun in star with the systematic studies of all available rhic energies : 200 , 130 , 62.4 and 19.6 gev . in the most recent run ( 
 run 8) an engineering study was undertaken by the collider and accelerator department in conjunction with the energy scan program . during this study , 
 the accelerator physicists demonstrated successful developments on injection and collisions of au ions at @xmath26  gev . 
 star was able to record the first low energy collisions , collecting about 3000 good events suitable for physics analysis . despite such limited statistics , 
 first results for identified hadron spectra , azimuthal anisotropy measurements and pion interferometry were already obtained  @xcite . 
 new data points added to the studies of the @xmath23 ratio systematics illustrate these achievements in figure 6 . with star s proven performance at low energy we are looking forward for new data in upcoming runs to further explore the qcd phase diagram and pin - point the location of the critical point . 
 we have discussed selected recent results from ongoing correlation analyses from star experiment . the results on ridge properties from triggered and non - triggered correlation studies were highlighted . 
 the large baryon to meson ratios , the uniformity of the ridge yield in @xmath15-@xmath15 space on event - by - event basis is suggestive of the bulk matter being the ridge origin . 
 first attempts towards full jet reconstruction in heavy ion collisions hold a lot of potential to provide further constraints on energy loss in qcd medium . 
 the data sample currently available is limited in statistics to fully exploit this technique . in the coming years 
 , star will continue collecting top energy data for @xmath8 and au+au collisions , providing the possibilities for more differential analyses . 
 another direction of star physics program is to partake in the rhic energy scan . 
 we will explore the qcd phase diagram in search for the onset of deconfinement and the location of critical point . 
 star has demonstrated the readiness to deliver physics results for the program with the analysis of the recent low energy test run .

96,"in june 2015 , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has resumed its physics program with proton - proton ( pp ) collisions at @xmath4 = 13 tev . 
 currently , this is the highest centre - of - mass energy reached in the laboratory . 
 a full description of particle production in pp collisions can not be obtained from perturbative quantum chromodynamics and hence modelling efforts typically employ various empirical components that have to be adjusted based on experimental data . 
 the measurement of light flavour particles production in pp collisions provides important input for event generators to model the soft parton interactions and the hadronization processes . 
 furthermore , pp collisions are used as reference to isolate medium effects present in larger colliding systems . 
 previous alice measurements @xcite , @xcite , @xcite on identified particles in pp collisions at lower energies show that the models usually give a fair description of the shapes of the @xmath1 spectra but fail on the description of the pion , kaon and proton yields . 
 @xmath5 , k@xmath6 , p and @xmath7 are identified in the rapidity window @xmath8 0.5 using several particle identification ( pid ) techniques in the different alice sub - detectors : the inner tracking system ( its ) , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , the time of flight detector ( tof ) and high momentum particle identification detector ( hmpid ) . 
 the combined information of these detectors in different @xmath1 regions allows us to measure the particle production in the region starting from 150 mev/_c _ up to 20 gev/_c_.    the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons are measured with invariant - mass analyses via the reconstruction of their hadronic decays . 
 the combinatorial background is subtracted using either a like - sign or event mixing technique . 
 the resulting invariant - mass distributions are then fitted . 
 previous measurements by alice and details on the analysis procedure can be found in @xcite . 
 the multi - strange @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 baryons are reconstructed via their weak hadronic decay products . 
 candidates are selected with restrictions on the topology of the decay and the signal is extracted from the resulting invariant mass distributions . 
 the full analysis procedure is described in @xcite . 
 the @xmath1-dependent @xmath15 and @xmath16 ratios measured in central rapidity ( @xmath17 0.5 ) at @xmath4 = 2.76 , 7.0 and 13 tev are shown in fig . 
 [ ratios ] . the comparison to pythia 8 @xcite ( monash-2013 @xcite ) for the different energies 
 is also shown .    within the systematic uncertainties 
 the @xmath16 ratio is consistent for the three different energies . 
 the @xmath15 ratio for the low - intermediate @xmath1 region shows a slight shift towards higher @xmath1 when increasing @xmath4 . within our systematic uncertainties 
 the ratio is compatible for the three different energies in the @xmath1 region above 10 gev/_c_. this shift is also observed on the monte carlo predictions from the pythia 8 model . the origin of the peak in pythia 8 is attributed to the colour reconnection mechanism @xcite , and is expected to become more important at higher centre - of - mass energy .    the @xmath1-integrated @xmath16 and @xmath15 ratios in pp collisions as a function of @xmath4 are shown in fig.[ratios_energies ] . 
 results at different energies for different experiments are also shown . 
 results from e735 at @xmath4 = 0.3 , 0.54 , 1.0 and 1.8 tev @xcite , @xcite , from phenix at @xmath4 = 62.4 and 200 gev @xcite and cms at @xmath4 = 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev @xcite are compared for both particle ratios . 
 the last added point at 13 tev confirms the similar trend and saturation for @xmath18 900 gev observed in alice previous measurements . 
 the hyperon - to - pion ratio as a function of @xmath4 measured in alice is shown in fig . 
 [ hyperon_ratio ] . in comparison with the kaon- and proton - to - pion ratio 
 the strange- and multi - strange - to - pion ratios show a hint of increase at 13 tev with respect to the lower collision energies . 
 this enhanced production may be related to the enhancement observed as a function of multiplicity in pp collisions at @xmath4 = 7 tev @xcite , as the charged particle multiplicity density increases with the collision energy . 
 the @xmath9 and @xmath10 meson production has been also measured in pp collisions at @xmath4 = 13 tev . 
 the @xmath1-integrated @xmath19 and @xmath20 ratios are shown in fig . 
 [ ratios_resonances ] . 
 however , no energy evolution is observed in the range from rhic to the highest lhc energy . 
 the @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath21 and @xmath16 is the same at lhc energies within our systematic errors . 
 pythia 8 describes the shape but exhibits large deviations from the data for transverse momenta larger than 2 gev/_c_. above @xmath22 900 gev the @xmath21 and @xmath16 ratios are energy independent within systematic uncertainties . the relative production of strange resonances ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) remains constant within a wide range of centre of mass energy . 
 multiplicity dependent studies in pp collisions at 13 tev will help disentangle the role of collision energy and event multiplicity in the identified particle production of pp collisions .

97,"hanle effect measurements ( bommier et al . 1994 ) have shown that quiescent ( non  active - region ) filaments have `` inverse '' magnetic polarity , meaning that their transverse field component is opposite in sign to that of the coronal loops crossing high over the photospheric neutral line . 
 the usual interpretation of this result is that the filament material is supported in the dipped or concave - upward portions of a twisted flux rope ( see , e.g. , van ballegooijen & martens 1989 ; rust & kumar 1994 ; low 1996 ; aulanier & dmoulin 1998 ; amari et al . 
 1999 ; lites 2005 ; gibson & fan 2006 ) . for this topology , 
 it is natural to assume that one sign of helicity prevails throughout the flux rope and its overlying arcade .    in an alternative scenario , 
 the filament is regarded as a sheared arcade whose intermediate legs or `` barbs '' are rooted in minority polarity on the `` wrong '' side of the neutral line ( martin 1998 ) . in that case , the helicity of the filament itself would be opposite in sign to that of the overlying coronal loops , contrary to most theoretical models . 
 possible support for this picture comes from the observation of continual flows along the spines and up and down the barbs of filaments ( zirker et al . 1998 ; wang 1999 ; kucera et al . 
 2003 ; lin et al . 
 2003 , 2005 ) ; such flows , which may be driven by chromospheric reconnection ( litvinenko & martin 1999 ; martin et al . 
 2008 ) , seem to obviate the need for static support within magnetic dips , one of the principal arguments in favor of a flux rope geometry . 
 statistically ( and independently of the flux rope / sheared arcade question ) , it is found that filaments in the northern ( southern ) hemisphere are predominantly `` dextral '' ( `` sinistral '' ) , meaning that their axial fields point to the right ( left ) when viewed from the positive - polarity side of the photospheric neutral line ( martin 1998 ; pevtsov et al . 
 2003 ; yeates et al . 2007 ; yeates & mackay 2009 ) . 
 dextral ( sinistral ) filaments have right - bearing ( left - bearing ) barbs but underlie arcades with left - handed ( right - handed ) helicity 
 . the helicity sign of the overlying arcade can be inferred from the skew of the arcade loops relative to the polarity inversion line ( pil ) . 
 although the magnetic topology of a stable filament / prominence remains a subject of debate , it is almost universally accepted that an erupting filament and its surrounding field have the structure of a twisted flux rope . in a three - dimensional system , 
 the pinching - off of pairs of stretched , opposite - polarity field lines beneath the rising filament will necessarily give rise to a flux rope ; reconnections may occur among the legs / barbs of the filament , between the legs and the overlying arcade , and among the highly distended arcade field lines themselves . 
 as the bright post - eruption arcade expands outward from the pil , the orientation of the reconnected loops ( seen projected against the photosphere ) will appear to rotate clockwise ( counterclockwise ) if the arcade has right - handed ( left - handed ) helicity ; this apparent rotation is due to the tendency for the loops rooted farther from the pil to cross it more nearly at right angles . 
 the axes of the erupting filaments themselves are sometimes observed to rotate about the vertical direction . as viewed from above 
 , this rotation is again usually clockwise if the post - event arcade has right - handed helicity , and counterclockwise if it has left - handed helicity ( for examples , see rust & labonte 2005 ; green et al . 2007 ; wang et al . 2009 ) . 
 the sense of rotation is consistent with the conversion of field - line twist into writhe ( three - dimensional twisting of the axis itself ) , as predicted by mhd simulations of kink - unstable flux ropes ( linton et al . 
 1999 ; kliem et al . 
 2004 ; trk & kliem 2005 ) and of sheared arcades that have been converted into erupting flux ropes via reconnection ( lynch et al . 
 it is reasonable to assume that the net helicity of the erupting structure is the sum of the helicity of the original filament and that of the surrounding field with which it has become entrained by reconnection ( see berger 1998 ) . 
 if the barb system and the overlying coronal field have opposite helicity signs , as suggested by martin ( 1998 ) , then in most events the main contribution to the helicity of the erupting structure must come from the surrounding field ( compare also the discussion of ruzmaikin et al . 
 however , the question arises as to whether the rotation ever occurs in the direction opposite to that implied by the helicity of the overlying arcade , thereby providing stronger support for the barb picture of martin .    here 
 we describe two events observed with the extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ; delaboudinire et al . 
 1995 ) on the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ 
 ( _ soho _ ) , in which the erupting quiescent filament appeared to rotate counterclockwise but the post - eruption arcade had right - handed helicity . 
 the sequence of 19.5  nm images in figure  1 shows the eruption of a southern - hemisphere filament on 1999 september  20 . 
 the dark filament in fact represents the western half of a longer structure that occupies a circular filament channel . 
 the axis of the erupting feature undergoes a continual counterclockwise rotation between @xmath003:00 and @xmath005:00  ut . in order to exhibit this rotation more clearly 
 , we have traced the filament spine at successive times and superposed these traces in figure  2 , after shifting them in longitude to correct for the average photospheric rotation . 
 we note that the observed motions can not be interpreted simply as a straightening of the initially highly curved filament as it rises , which would require both the northern and southern portions of the filament to move eastward ; instead , the northern section moves eastward but the southern section moves westward , consistent with a counterclockwise rotation of the filament axis . 
 subsequently ( after 04:48  ut ) , the rotation `` overshoots '' near both the northern and southern ends of the erupting filament , which thus kinks into a forward - s shape . 
 as shown in figure 1 , the post - event arcade with its double row of footpoint brightenings begins to form after @xmath004:36  ut . 
 in addition , in the images recorded between 04:36 and 05:12  ut , euv brightenings ( circled in figure 
 1 ) may be seen at the far endpoints of the erupting filament ; these brightenings occur as the filament threads , anchored well outside the filament channel itself , are jerked upward into a vertical orientation ( see wang et al . 
 2009 ) . from the slant of the post - eruption loops in the image taken at 06:00  ut , and from the apparent clockwise rotation of the loop orientation between 06:00 and 07:13  ut 
 , we conclude that the overlying arcade has right - handed helicity , even though the filament rotates counterclockwise . the first post - eruption loops ( observed at 06:00  ut ) are located near the original pivot point of the filament rotation , where the traces approximately intersect in figure  2 , suggesting that the instability and rapid upward motion of the filament were initiated in this region . 
 figure 3 shows the distribution of photospheric magnetic flux underlying the erupting filament . here 
 , we compare a michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) line - of - sight magnetogram taken at 04:48  ut with the difference between the 19.5  nm images recorded at 04:48 and 04:36  ut . the magnetogram , saturated at @xmath150  g , represents a 5-minute average of higher - cadence data . 
 the circular filament channel evidently encloses a positive - polarity region . since the northern ( southern ) end of the erupting filament 
 is rooted in negative - polarity ( positive - polarity ) network flux , the axial field of the filament points toward the left as viewed from the positive - polarity region , and the filament is sinistral according to the chirality definition of martin ( 1998 ) . 
 correspondingly , an h@xmath2 image taken on september  18 at the big bear solar observatory ( bbso ) shows left - bearing barbs ( figure  4 , top panel ) .    as indicated by the 30.4  nm images in the left column of figure  5 , the filament re - forms immediately after the eruption ; however , its northern end now bends westward rather than eastward ( see also the h@xmath2 image in figure  4 , bottom panel ) . 
 the mdi magnetograms in the right column of figure  5 suggest that this change in the shape of the filament , as well as the eruption itself , may have been associated with the emergence of a small magnetic bipole to the west of the original filament channel . 
 the new bipole ( circled in the magnetograms taken at 06:27 and 13:19  ut ) appears to have altered the shape of the photospheric neutral line in the vicinity of the filament .    in association with this filament event , 
 the large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ) on _ soho _ observed a faint halo coronal mass ejection ( cme ) with an average speed of 600  km  s@xmath3 . 
 the sequence of eit 30.4  nm images in figure 6 , taken at 6-hourly intervals , shows the disappearance of a high - latitude filament in the southern hemisphere on 2001 september  28 . in the frame 
 recorded at 13:19  ut , during the eruption itself , the axis of the filament shows a pronounced counterclockwise rotation relative to its pre - eruption orientation . 
 this kinking into a forward - s shape is seen even more clearly in figure  7 , where we have superposed four successive traces of the filament spine taken between 19:19  ut on september  27 and 13:19  ut on september  28 , after removing the effect of the photospheric differential rotation . 
 the eruption is shown in more detail in the sequence of 19.5  nm running - difference images in figure  8 . 
 the post - event arcade begins to form at 15:00  ut , with the appearance of a compact bundle of highly sheared loops that are almost aligned with the filament channel . from the mdi magnetogram ( fourth panel of figure  8) 
 , we conclude that the western end of this narrow bundle of reconnected loops lies on the negative - polarity side of the photospheric neutral line , implying right - handed helicity . that the overlying arcade is indeed right - handed is confirmed by the subsequently forming loops ( bottom panel of figure  8) , which are rooted farther from the pil and are shifted clockwise relative to the earlier loops . 
 h@xmath2 images recorded at bbso on september  27 show that the pre - eruption filament had left - bearing barbs ( see figure  9 ) , consistent with sinistral chirality . 
 filaments are conventionally regarded as cool material supported inside the dips of a helical flux rope of a given `` handedness . '' 
 if the flux rope becomes unstable , its axis rotates about the direction of ascent , with the rotation being clockwise ( counterclockwise ) if the flux rope has right - handed ( left - handed ) helicity . although observations of filament eruptions have tended to support this picture , we have here described two events in which the filament rotated in the opposite sense to that implied by the handedness of the surrounding arcade . 
 both of these quiescent filaments were located in the southern hemisphere and had left - bearing barbs ; their axes rotated counterclockwise , even though the post - event arcades were clearly right - handed . by helicity conservation ( berger 1984 ) , the source regions must have had mixed helicity , since the left - handed writhe acquired through the counterclockwise rotation could only have originated in negative helicity embodied as twist or shear in the pre - eruption field . 
 if the filament barbs are concave - downward features , as advocated by martin ( 1998 ) , their helicity sign or handedness would be opposite to that of the overlying coronal loops . 
 the direction of rotation of the erupting structure would then depend on whether the barbs or the overlying arcade provides the main contribution to the net helicity . from a preliminary survey of the entire eit database for solar cycle  23 
 , we were able to determine unambiguously the direction of rotation of an erupting filament in only @xmath010 events . 
 presumably because of the relatively low cadence of the eit observations , all of these events involved non  active - region filaments , of which only the two discussed here rotated in the `` wrong '' sense . in the active region events examined by rust & labonte ( 2005 ) and green et al . 
 ( 2007 ) , the acquired writhe of the erupting filament and the helicity observed in the surrounding field were always of the same sign . 
 thus , if the barbs and the surrounding field have opposite helicity signs , then the helicity of the overlying arcade must dominate in most eruptions , particularly those occurring in active regions . that the exceptions found here involve quiescent filaments 
 might be due to the fact that the latter are more likely to have well - developed barb systems than active region filaments . as suggested by wang ( 2001 ) , 
 barbs form when flux elements that have become connected to the overlying axial field diffuse across the filament channel and undergo flux cancellation on the other side . 
 that the helicity tends to be concentrated in the surrounding field rather than in the filament itself is consistent with recent models of active region fields , in which a flux rope is inserted into a potential configuration and the system is allowed to relax , including the effect of a helicity - conserving magnetic diffusion ( bobra et al . 
 2008 ; su et al . 
 the observed h@xmath2 filament and surrounding coronal - loop structure are best fit with a highly sheared but weakly twisted flux rope held down by the overlying arcade ; as in a hollow solenoid , the electric currents and magnetic helicity are concentrated in a semi - cylindrical shell around the outer edge of the flux rope , not within its interior , where the field lines are essentially straight and not much current flows . 
 moreover , for stability , the amount of axial flux must be small compared with the total flux that holds down the filament . 
 thus it is not surprising that it is the helicity of the surrounding field that usually determines the direction of rotation of an erupting active - region filament . 
 the event of 1999 september 20 provides support for the hypothesis that some filament eruptions are triggered by the emergence of flux near the filament channel ( see , e.g. , bruzek 1952 ; feynman & martin 1995 ; wang & sheeley 1999 ) . in this particular case , 
 the eruption was accompanied by a reconfiguration of both the underlying photospheric neutral line and the shape of the filament itself . 
 sheeley et al . 
 ( 1975 ) described a rather similar event in which the eastward hook of an h@xmath2 filament disappeared and was replaced by a westward hook that pointed toward a region of newly emerging flux ( the sense in which the filament axis rotated during the eruption is unknown ) .

98,"noncovalent functionalization of single - walled carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) with photoactive molecules is becoming a promising technique to explore functional materials for light - harvesting or optoelectronic applications . 
 @xcite the coupling of the exceptional cnt transport properties with the optical properties of functional dyes , like porphyrins with a strong absorption in the near infrared and visible , make of cnt / dye complexes good candidates for sensitive nanoscale devices with potential applications in biomedical imaging , @xcite and hybrid organic - inorganic photovoltaic devices . 
 @xcite however , the strength of the @xmath4-stacking interaction with respect to the cnt structural parameters , like the diameter and chirality , is still lacking . 
 in addition , a better understanding of the cnt / dye optical properties considering changes in the dye structure due to the @xmath4-conjugation is needed . 
 recently , the kinetics and thermodynamics properties of non - covalently bound cnt / porphyrin oligomers have been investigated by uv / visible spectroscopy and fluorescence titration.@xcite it was reported that the affinity of the cnts increases sharply with the porphyrin coverage , showing strongest binding energies for semiconducting cnts , particularly those with chiral indices ( 7,5 ) and ( 8,6 ) . in addition , others works have also investigated a supposed selective interaction of porphyrins towards semiconducting cnts , suggesting that the semiconducting and metallic cnts would have significantly different surface properties.@xcite these works have also suggested that noncovalent functionalization of a mixture of cnts with porphyrins may be an effective method for the separation of semiconducting cnts from metallic cnts . 
 previously , we reported physisorption properties of iron porphyrin on both metallic and semiconducting cnts with similar diameters.@xcite our results showed a surprising strong @xmath4-stacking interaction , but with negligible energy differences . 
 similar results were found for the physisorption strength of free - base and zinc porphyrins on the same semiconducting cnt,@xcite showing no clue on the suspected selectivity . 
 considering the increasing interest in the noncovalent complexation of cnt - based materials for optoelectronic applications , we carry out an in - depth investigation on the stability and optical response of free - base tetraphenyporphyrin ( tpp ) molecules @xmath4-stacked on single - walled cnts with different chiralities and diameters , and also on graphene . 
 our purpose is to give a theoretically insight into the binding strength and optical properties of these compounds as a function of the cnt structural parameters . 
 our results show that the diameter instead chirality would be the relevant cnt parameter to explain the unusual strength of the tpp @xmath4-stacking interaction . 
 in addition , the tpp binding energy on metallic and semiconducting cnts does not exhibit important differences that might suggest distinct interactions . 
 regarding optical properties , we find that transition bands of the @xmath4-stacked tpp remain at almost the same energy position than those found in the isolated tpp , being independent of the cnt structural parameters . 
 for the tpp physisorption on graphene , we find a very strong binding energy , of about 3.2  ev , providing an upper limit for the stability of cnt - tpp compounds . 
 we also find a @xmath5-type doping on graphene induced by the tpp adsorption . 
 our density functional theory ( dft ) calculations were performed using the siesta _ ab initio _ package,@xcite which employ norm - conserving pseudopotentials and localized atomic orbitals as basis set ( double-@xmath6 , singly polarized ) . 
 the physisorption of tpp on both the cnt sidewall and graphene is assessed by van der waals density functional ( vdw - df ) as proposed by dion _ 
 et al._@xcite this approach has been successfully applied to describe the dispersive interaction of aromatic molecules on the graphite surface , showing good agreement with available experimental data.@xcite    in recent experiments , the functionalization of cnts with tpp molecules has been achieved by the micelle swelling methods in water suspension,@xcite where the cnt - tpp compound stays in the micelle core . 
 because of the hydrophobic character of this core , it is not expected water molecules surrounding the compound , which can be considered close to a vacuum situation . in the present work we study the tpp physisorption 42 different cnt species , particularly those with chiral indices ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) , with @xmath7 and @xmath3 . 
 the cnt - tpp compounds are studied within the supercell approach , with periodic boundary conditions along the nanotube axis ( @xmath8 direction ) . 
 we use unit cells with a volume of ( @xmath9 )  @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is cnt lattice constant and @xmath12 a factor to keep a minimum distance among tpp images along the cnts , chosen to be of 10   . 
 this procedure results in supercell lengths ( @xmath13 ) between 22 - 57   , which can contain up to 754 atoms . 
 a grid cutoff of 100  ry and the @xmath14 point were used for the real - space and @xmath15-space integration , respectively . for the optical calculations , we use a @xmath16 @xmath15-point mesh , for incident light polarized along the cnt axis . 
 the accuracy of these parameters were tested considering larger grid cutoff ( 150  ry ) and @xmath15-point mesh ( @xmath17 ) . 
 negligible variations in the total energies , optical spectra , and band structures were found , ensuring that our results are converged . 
 for the tpp physisorption on graphene , we use a squared unit cell with @xmath18 periodicity and the @xmath14 point for the @xmath15-space integration . here , a vacuum region of 20    among graphene an their images was considered . for the optical response we use a @xmath15-point mesh of @xmath19 , for incident light polarized parallel to the graphene plane ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions ) . the tpp binding energy on the substrates is calculated by the energy difference between adsorbed and separated constituents , considering corrections due to the basis set superposition error . 
 the complexes were fully relaxed by conjugate gradient minimization until the forces on the atoms were less than 0.05  ev /  . 
 the optical response of the functionalized cnts and graphene is obtained through first order time dependent perturbation theory , by calculating the imaginary part of the dielectric function ( @xmath22 ) . 
 @xmath22 gives us a first approach for the optical absorption coefficient and it is calculated according to the equation : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is a constant that depends on the cell sizes ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the occupied and empty kohn - sham orbitals , respectively . 
 the delta function represents the conservation of energy , which is described by a gaussian function with a smearing of 0.06  ev . 
 it is important to note that dft calculations fail in describing electron - hole and electron - electron interactions , the so called many - body effects . 
 these effects are responsible for the formation of excitons and the quasiparticle excitation . 
 @xcite therefore , an accurate description of photoexcitations in cnts and graphene needs theories beyond dft , like those based on the gw - bethe - salpeter equation ( gw - bse).@xcite however , these calculations are not possible right now , considering the size of the systems under study . 
 thus , @xmath22 can give us a first approach for the optical response of @xmath4-stacked tpp on cnts and graphene . 
 the main difference of dft calculations with respect to gw - bse is a redshift in the absorption spectrum . 
 for instance , in graphene this redshift is found to be about 0.6  ev.@xcite 
 we first discuss different adsorption geometries for the tpp molecule on the cnts . 
 figure  [ f1 ] shows the equilibrium geometry of a tpp adsorbed on a ( 8,7 ) cnt . here , the n - h bonds of tpp are oriented perpendicular to the cnt axis , that we called position ( i ) . 
 two other positions for tpp are likely to be found : with the n - h bonds parallel to the cnt axis ( ii ) , and with the n - h bonds forming an angle of 45@xmath27 with respect to the cnt axis ( iii ) . although position ( i ) is found to be the most stable , the other positions have total energies within 0.3  ev , suggesting that all three are equally probables . in the equilibrium geometry , the tpp phenyl groups exhibit a small rotation , which come with a molecular twisting . to compare the stability of different cnt - tpp complexes , only position ( i ) will be considered throughout this work . 
 the adsorption distance is measured between the cnt surface and the n atoms of tpp , as shown in figure  [ f1 ] . 
 .adsorption distance ( @xmath28 ) , binding energy ( @xmath29 ) , and bandgap energy ( @xmath30 ) of cnt - tpp complexes . 
 @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the cnt diameter and chiral angle , respectively . 
 results for tpp on graphene ( g - tpp ) are also included . [ 
 cols=""<,<,<,<,<,<"",options=""header "" , ]     [ t1 ]    table  [ t1 ] lists tpp binding energies and binding distances for all the complex under study . 
 we also include the dft bandgaps for the semiconducting complexes . 
 those with small bandgaps ( @xmath330.1  ev ) are consistent with empirical model predictions of @xmath34 as well as with experimental data.@xcite we observe that binding energies and adsorption distances vary in ranges given by @xmath35  ev and @xmath36   , respectively . 
 we note that stronger tpp @xmath4-stacking interactions result in larger adsorption distance . 
 this can be understood by look at the tpp phenyl groups , whose h atoms become closer to the cnt surface for large diameter cnts , as can be seen in figure  [ f1 ] . to estimate an upper limit for @xmath29 and @xmath28 
 , we calculate the tpp physisorption on graphene , which can be considered as a cnt with an infinite diameter . 
 we find @xmath37  ev and @xmath38   . 
 although the binding distance is similar to those found on cnts with @xmath39   , the binding energy is considerably larger , with almost twice the value found on the cnts . 
 this can be understood because of the larger graphene - tpp overlap area , which tend to maximize the @xmath4-stacking interaction . 
 figure  [ f2 ] shows the cnt - tpp binding energy as a function of the cnt diameter . 
 we observe an almost linear increase in the tpp attachment strength with the cnt diameter , which in some way confirms our assumption that larger cnt - tpp overlap area tends to increase the binding energy of the molecule . 
 however , this general tendency is not followed in some cases , as can be seen in fig . 
 for instance , ( i ) the larger tpp binding energy found for the ( 5,0 ) cnt ( @xmath40   ) with respect to the ( 6,0 ) cnt ( @xmath41   ) , by about 0.2  ev , and ( ii ) the abrupt changes in the tpp binding energy profile going from ( 6,0 ) to ( 6,1 ) , ( 7,5 ) to ( 7,6 ) , and ( 8,5 ) to ( 8,6 ) . 
 we attribute these results to the particular atomic geometry of the cnt atoms just below the tpp molecule . 
 we observe that the cnt - tpp binding distance tends to increase when the h atoms of the phenyl groups nearest neighbors to the cnt surface , lie exactly above nanotube c - atoms . 
 this effect is due to the steric repulsion between them , which also explain the broad variation on the binding distances between the cnt surface and the tpp n - atoms , as shown in figure  [ f3 ] . 
 figure  [ f4 ] shows the cnt - tpp binding energy as a function of the cnt chiral angle . 
 apparently , higher chiral angles would induce stronger tpp attachment . 
 however , if we compare the tpp attachment on cnts with similar diameters and binding distances with those plotted as a function of the chiral angle , we observe that they have also similar binding energy , suggesting that the cnt diameter instead chirality is the relevant parameter involved in the strong tpp binding energy . 
 for instance , if we take the cnts with chiral indices ( 5,4 ) and ( 7,2 ) , they show almost the same tpp binding energy when plotted with respect to both the cnt diameter ( fig .  [ f2 ] ) and adsorption distance ( fig . 
 however , they also show the same binding energy when plotted with respect to the chiral angle ( fig . 
 the same behavior can be verified for the pairs of cnts ( 5,5)-(6,4 ) and ( 6,5)-(7,4 ) . 
 these results suggest that the strength of the tpp interaction on the cnts would not be related to the cnt surface geometry or chirality , but to the cnt diameter .    the adsorption energy of benzene and naphthalene on cnts ( 7 - 8   diameter ) , using electron - correlated moller - plasset ( mp2 ) method reports binding energies for benzene and naphthalene of 0.18 and 0.48 ev , respectively . 
 @xcite this results suggest an overestimation of the tpp adsorption energy on cnts . however , temperature programmed desorption experiments performed in ultrahigh vacuum have measured the binding energy of polyaromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) adsorbed on graphite , showing quite strong desorption energies . 
 @xcite in that work , benzene , naphthalene , coronene , and ovalene adsorbed on graphite show desorption energies of 0.50 , 0.85 , 1.4 , and 2.1 ev , respectively . 
 for the case of benzene and naphthalene , the experimental values almost double the mp2-theory values . even considering the cnt curvatures , the @xmath4-stacking interaction appears to be much more larger than the usually expected . 
 in addition , a recent study of pahs adsorption on graphene shows that the vdw - df calculations exhibit excellent agreement with the available experimental data , while empirical and semiempirical calculations only preserve the correct trends.@xcite in summary , the work concludes that the adsorption interaction of @xmath4-conjugate systems on graphene are a complex combination of dispersive and electrostatic interactions , which would explains to some extent our results for the large adsorption energies of tpp on both graphene and cnts . 
 noncovalent functionalization of a single - walled ( 6,5 ) cnt with tpp molecules have been reported in aqueous solution by mean of the micellar suspension method.@xcite the optical absorption of ( 6,5)-tpp complexes shows resonances at 2.357 and 2.831  ev , which are associated to the @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( soret ) tpp bands , respectively.@xcite our results for the optical response of the ( 6,5)-tpp complex for a polarization parallel to the tube axis , show clear transitions at 1.60 and 2.04  ev , which we associate to the tpp @xmath42 and @xmath43 bands , respectively . 
 the difference in energy between these peaks ( 0.44  ev ) is almost the same than those observed in the experiments ( 0.474  ev).@xcite however , the theoretical peaks show a redshift of about 0.8  ev with respect to the experimental ones , while the shape of the absorption spectra would be preserved . 
 this shift is associated to many - body effects previously discussed . 
 therefore , through the @xmath22 calculation it is possible to investigate , qualitatively , changes in the optical properties of different cnt - tpp complexes in term of the cnt structural parameters , like diameter or chirality . 
 figure  [ f5 ] and [ f6 ] show @xmath22 as a function of the photon energy , for incident light polarized parallel to the tube axis , for the semiconducting cnt - tpp complexes . 
 the red and black spectra indicate the optical response of cnt - tpp and the isolated cnt , respectively . 
 the vertical dashed lines indicate the position of the tpp @xmath42 ( 1.60  ev ) and @xmath43 ( 2.04  ev ) bands . 
 the optical spectra clearly show the absorption of the @xmath4-stacked tpp at almost the same position than the isolated tpp , indicating that the tpp absorption properties would be preserved in the complexes , being independent of the cnt diameter or chirality . 
 however , we must note that the present results were obtained considering only one tpp molecule on the cnts . 
 increasing tpp coverages may change this conclusion . 
 the optical response of complexes considering metallic and semimetallic cnts ( not shown ) exhibit the same properties . 
 another interesting feature is the resonance between the cnt @xmath44 transition with the @xmath43 band for the cnts : ( 5,4 ) , ( 6,1 ) , ( 7,3 ) , and ( 10,0 ) , and with the @xmath42 band for the cnts : ( 6,1 ) , ( 7,5 ) , ( 7,6 ) , and ( 7,2 ) . 
 this tuning between @xmath44 and the tpp bands would increase the emission of the corresponding complex . 
 figure  [ f7 ] shows the electronic band structure and density of states ( dos ) of the graphene - tpp compound described in a squared reciprocal lattice . 
 the vertical arrows show the optical transition between the frontier molecular orbitals of the @xmath4-stacked tpp , which correspond to the dispersionless subbands . here , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is the transition from homo to lumo ( lumo+1 ) , while @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is the transitions from homo-1 to lumo ( lumo+1 ) . 
 these absorptions arise from @xmath49 transitions and can be characterized approximately by considering only the four molecular levels above mentioned . 
 @xcite in pristine graphene , the valence - band maximum and conduction - band minimum touch at one point in the @xmath15 space , the dirac point , which occurs at the fermi energy . 
 this indicates that graphene is a zero - gap semiconductor . in fig . 
 [ f7 ] , we observe that the fermi energy ( the dashed line ) is shifted upward with respect to the dirac point energy , which indicates a charge transfer from tpp to graphene , revealing a @xmath0-type doping mechanism . therefore , graphene would change its electronic characteristic induced by the strong tpp complexation . as the @xmath4-stacking molecule do not alter the graphene atomic structure , their transport properties would be preserved . 
 similar results have been reported for other aromatic molecules physisorbed on graphene.@xcite    figure  [ f8 ] shows @xmath22 of a tpp @xmath4-stacked on graphene , the g - tpp compound , considering an in - plain polarizations of incident light . for pristine graphene , we find a strong absorption in the infrared , below 1  ev , and a less intense absorption in the ultraviolet , at around 4  ev , which are attributed to transitions among @xmath4 and @xmath50 bands . 
 these results are in qualitative agreement with calculated absorption spectra using the gw - bse approach as well as with experiments,@xcite unless the redshift previously discussed . for functionalized graphene , 
 we observe two intense absorptions at around 1.57 and 1.96  ev , corresponding to the @xmath51 and @xmath52 bands of the @xmath4-stacked tpp . 
 these peaks show a redshift with respect to those of the isolated tpp of 0.05  ev , which is associated to the distortion of the tpp phenyl groups due to the strong @xmath4-stacking interaction . 
 additional peaks at around 2.6 and 3.1  ev are also associated to the tpp molecule . 
 we have theoretically investigated the stability and optical absorption properties of a free - base tpp molecule @xmath4-stacked on single - walled cnts , as well as on graphene . 
 42 cnts with chiral indices ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 , have been studied . in term of the diameter , 
 they range within @xmath53   . 
 the tpp physisorption is described by van der waals density functional while the optical properties through the imaginary part of the dielectric function in the linear optical response . 
 we find a strong cnt - tpp @xmath4-stacking interaction , with binding energies and adsorption distance varying within @xmath35  ev and @xmath36   , respectively , where larger @xmath29 and @xmath28 are obtained for increasing cnt diameters . 
 our results indicates that diameter instead chirality is the relevant parameter for the strong tpp physisorption , which would be originated in the increasing overlap area between tpp and the cnts . 
 an upper limit for the cnt - tpp binding strength can be estimated through the tpp physisorption on graphene , which can be viewed as an infinite - diameter cnt . 
 we find very strong @xmath4-stacking interactions , with @xmath37  ev and @xmath38   . 
 however , this strong interaction is not enough to open an energy gap in the functionalized graphene , but it can induce a charge transfer from tpp , suggesting a @xmath0-type doping mechanism without compromising the graphene structure and transport properties . concerning optical properties , we find that @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( soret ) tpp absorption bands remain at almost the same energy position after the physisorption on the cnts , being independent of the cnt structural parameters . whereas on graphene , the tpp bands show a redshift of about 0.05  ev , which are associated to the distortion of the phenyl groups due to the strong @xmath4-stacking interaction . 
 finally , our results suggest that both compounds cnt - tpp and g - tpp exhibit remarkable stability while preserving the absorption properties of the chromophore , which may be of interest for light - harvesting and bio - labeling applications .","the stability , electronic and optical properties of single - walled carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) and graphene noncovalently functionalized with free - base tetraphenylporphyrin ( tpp ) molecules is addressed by density functional theory calculations , including corrections to dispersive interactions .

 thus the fluorescence in the red roi ( figure [ fig : example]c ) is a superposition of the background and the neuron s temporal activity , whereas the green ( figure [ fig : example]d ) provides an estimation of the background signal . by subtracting these two traces 
 , we are able to roughly estimate the temporal activity of the neuron within the red roi ( figure [ fig : example]e ) . from this example 
 , we can see that the background is an order of magnitude larger than the neural activity and its fluctuations are as fast as neuronal calcium transients . 
 these features make it difficult to detect and demix cellular signals automatically from the raw video . 
 our work is based on a matrix factorization approach , which can simultaneously segment cells and estimate changes in fluorescence in the temporal domain . 
 this approach stems from the observation that spatiotemporal calcium activity can be approximated as product of two matrices : a spatial matrix that encodes the location of each neuron and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration evolution for each neuron . 
 it has several variations with different constraints , such as independent component analysis ( pca - ica , @xcite ) , nonnegative matrix factorization ( nmf , @xcite ) , sparse space - time deconvolution ( sstd , @xcite ) and constrained nonnegative matrix factorization ( cnmf , @xcite ) . in particular , pca - ica seeks spatiotemporal components that have reduced dependence . 
 it is an inherently linear demixing method and can fail in the case when the neural components exhibit significant spatial overlaps ( @xcite ) . 
 nonlinear methods like nmf , sstd and cnmf can deal with overlapping neural sources more effectively , and often outperform pca - ica . 
 the main applications of these nonlinear methods are 2-photon or light - sheet imaging data , where the background is weak and has simple spatiotemporally separable structure . 
 they usually model the background with a rank-1 nonnegative matrix . 
 however , applying these nonlinear matrix factorization methods to the microendoscopic data faces two problems : ( 1 ) the background term is not well modeled by rank-1 nmf and its large residual could contaminate the extracted neuronal signals ; ( 2 ) the procedures of initializing the model parameters , especially spatial and temporal components of neurons , in these models do not work well because the strong and noisy background mixes with the weak neural signals . 
 since the optimization problem in these methods are non - convex , without good initialization , it may lead to low - quality results or require excessive time for convergent results .      in this paper , we extend the cnmf framework ( @xcite ) to address strong fluctuations in background fluorescence , and make it applicable to microendoscopic data . 
 like the proposed cnmf in @xcite , our extended cnmf for microendoscopic data ( cnmf - e ) also has the capability of identifying neurons with low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and simultaneously denoising , deconvolving and demixing large - scale microendoscopic data . to accomplish this : ( 1 ) we replace the rank-1 nmf approximation of the background with a more sophisticated approximation , which can better account the complex background and avoid absorbing cellular signals , and ( 2 ) we develop an efficient initialization procedure to extract neural activities with minimal influence from the background . 
 the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : cnmf ] 
 we briefly review the cnmf model and describe our modifications to the model . in section [ sec : fit_model ] 
 , we develop our specialized model fitting procedure . in section [ sec : result ] we validate our new proposed cnmf - e on simulated and experimental data , and we also compare it with the widely used pca - ica method ( @xcite ) .    * notation * a matrix @xmath0 represents the spatiotemporal activity of @xmath1 pixels in @xmath2 frames . 
 the column vector @xmath3 is the observation of the whole frame in time - step @xmath4 . 
 we use @xmath5 to refer the spatial location of one pixel , thus @xmath6 is the fluorescence intensity in @xmath4-th frame at location @xmath7 . for a column vector @xmath8 encoding the spatial information of @xmath1 pixels , @xmath9 indicates the value of @xmath10 at pixel @xmath7 . 
 the video data we have are observations from the optical field for a total number of @xmath2 frames . 
 the recorded data can be represented by a matrix @xmath11 , where @xmath1 is the number of pixels in the field . 
 each neuron is characterized by its spatial ` footprint ' vector @xmath12 and ` calcium activity ' @xmath13 . here 
 both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are forced to be nonnegative because of their physical interpretations . 
 given @xmath16 of one neuron , its spatiotemporal activity is represented as @xmath17 . 
 the background activity is represented by a matrix @xmath18 . 
 suppose the field contains a total number of @xmath19 neurons , then the observation is a superposition of all neurons spatiotemporal activity , time - varying background and additive noise : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , c=[\mathbf{c}_1 , \cdots , \mathbf{c}_k]^t$ ] . 
 the noise term @xmath22 is assumed to be gaussian and @xmath23 . 
 @xmath24 is a diagonal matrix indicating that the noise is spatially and temporally uncorrelated . 
 @xcite also explicitly model the calcium dynamics @xmath15 with a stable autoregressive process ( ar ) of order @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of spikes that neuron fired at the @xmath4-th frame and it is sparse in the neural systems . 
 the ar coefficients @xmath28 are different for each neuron and they are estimated from the data .    estimating the model parameters @xmath29 in model ( [ eq : y])([eq : arp ] ) can give us all neurons spatial footprints and their deconvolved temporal activities . to fit the model , we also have to constrain the background term to have simplified structure , otherwise letting @xmath30 leads to the least reconstruction error . 
 this framework is general and we use it in our new method as well . 
 compared with the proposed implementation in @xcite , our method models the background term differently .    in the work of @xcite , they model the background with a rank-1 nonnegative matrix @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 encode the background spatial and temporal structure respectively 
 this is a good assumption for two - photon or light - sheet imaging data , but the background in microendoscopic data requires a more complex model . 
 we also have to avoid the increased complexity from absorbing cellular signals into the background . 
 thus the ideal model should explicitly model the background features that are distinct from neurons of interest . here 
 we include two main features of the background into the model of @xmath34 : ( 1 ) the temporal component of each pixel has a constant large baseline and some slow trends ( see figure [ fig : example]d ) and ( 2 ) background is usually spatially smooth in a larger spatial range compared with neuron size ( figure [ fig : example ] ) , which means the background of all pixels within a neuron does not have large spatial gradients . 
 this is because the fluctuations in the background reflects the out - of - focus fluorescence and they are significantly blurred . 
 hence we model the background term as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 . 
 @xmath38 explains the constant baselines and slow trends for all pixels ( figure [ fig : example]c ) and their temporal dynamics are much slower than calcium indicators . 
 the second term @xmath39 models the fast fluctuation in the background and the spatial component @xmath40 has low spatial - frequency structure . 
 the constraint of @xmath40 excludes cellular signals from the background term . 
 in this section , we will describe our customized algorithm for fitting the model ( [ eq : y])([eq : arp])([eq : bg ] ) . 
 we frequently use the pixel - wise formulation of model ( [ eq : y ] ) and ignore the noise term : @xmath41 our framework can be summarized into the following steps :    1 . 
 initialize @xmath42 using the new initialization procedure . 
 2 .   approximate the background @xmath43 using model ( [ eq : bg ] ) . 
 update @xmath42 from data @xmath44 using constrained alternating matrix factorization . 
 4 .   post - process the results automatically or manually : delete neurons , pick the missed neurons from the residuals , and merge neurons with high temporal correlations . 
 repeat steps 2 , 3 , 4 until the results are biologically meaningful . 
 our techniques differ from @xcite in the following aspects : ( 1 ) the initialization step for @xmath45 and @xmath46 here requires careful considerations of the background contaminations and our approach is totally new . 
 ( 2 ) instead of updating the background term iteratively , we update the background independently in different iterations and the rank of the background model can be modified in each iteration . as a result , our algorithm has a better control of the residual levels in background .    in the followings , we mainly describe our novel initialization step and briefly summarize the procedure of fitting the background term . as for steps ( 3 - 5 ) and discussions for scalability issue , we put them in the supplementary materials ( section [ supp : iterative_manual ] and [ supp : speed ] ) .    , the initialized temporal activity of one neuron . 
 d@xmath47 , raw data of the cropped small window ( green square in a and b ) . 
 e@xmath47 , the estimated time - varying local backgrounds in the small cropped window . 
 c@xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the re - ordered version of c@xmath47 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . 
 c@xmath53 is the temporal differencing of c@xmath48 and the result has been thresholded with its @xmath54 standard deviation . 
 similarly , d@xmath53 is differencing result of d@xmath48 . 
 f , the initialized spatial and temporal components of the neuron.,width=529 ]      here we develop a robust procedure for initializing @xmath45 and @xmath46 without estimation of the background . 
 this procedure utilizes the spatial smoothness feature in the background and removes it by spatial high - pass filtering of the raw data . 
 we estimate the temporal component of one neuron @xmath15 from spatially filtered data and then use it to extract the corresponding spatial footprint @xmath14 from the raw data . in the step of estimating @xmath14 , we re - order all frames to make nearby frames share the similar local background levels and then take the temporal differencing to remove the background signals temporally . 
 after that , we can use regression to get @xmath14 . repeating 
 this process can initialize the required number of neurons . 
 the whole procedure is schematically illustrated in figure [ fig : initialization ] and described in algorithm [ alg : init ] in the supplementary materials . 
 the spatial smoothness assumption of the background leads to @xmath55 i.e. , within the spatial range of a cell body , the background is spatially invariant . 
 based on this assumption , we use @xmath56 to filter the raw data @xmath6 , and @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 . 
 @xmath59 is a gaussian kernel with width @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the the average size of the neurons . 
 @xmath56 is a template matching filter to detect spatial structures with similar shapes and sizes . for flat structures in the small regions , like background , filtering them with @xmath56 
 get results close to 0 . 
 thus in the filtered data @xmath62 , the background @xmath63 has been roughly removed and @xmath64 is mainly composed of cellular signals ( figure [ fig : initialization]b ) . 
 more interestingly , the calcium concentrations of most neurons can be directly approximated by the temporal traces of some pixels in @xmath64 . 
 ( figure [ fig : initialization]c@xmath47 , see section [ supp : filter ] in supplementary materials for derivation ) . 
 we call these pixels seed pixels because we can use them to initialize neurons . 
 we initialize neurons with a greedy algorithm . in each iteration , we find one seed pixel @xmath65 ( see supplementary materials section [ sec : seed ] for details of how to detect seed pixels ) and initialize its spatial footprint @xmath66 and temporal course @xmath67 
 . then we subtract @xmath68 from the raw video data , find the next seed pixel and repeat the initialization procedure until specified number of neurons have been initialized or no more seed pixels exist .    given a seed pixel @xmath65 , we can initialize the neuron s temporal component as @xmath69 ( figure [ fig : initialization]c@xmath47 ) . 
 this approximation is usually good , and here we propose an efficient method to extract its spatial component @xmath14 from the raw data @xmath70 . 
 we first crop the optical field with a square centered at @xmath65 and the square size is twice larger than the average neuron size @xmath61 ( figure [ fig : initialization]d@xmath47 ) . 
 since cell bodies have localized structure , the spatial shape of the expected neuron is completely covered by this square . 
 then we approximate the local background level in this cropped area @xmath71 using the median of the fluorescence intensities on the square boundary ( figure [ fig : initialization]e@xmath47 ) . by sorting all frames in an order of @xmath72 such that @xmath73 ( figure [ fig : initialization]c@xmath48d@xmath48e@xmath48 ) , nearby frames have the minimal differences ( @xmath74 ) in the background term . 
 hence the differencing of the sorted video data is @xmath75 we already have @xmath76 , so we can initialize @xmath14 by regressing @xmath77 on @xmath78 ( figure [ fig : initialization]c@xmath53d@xmath53 ) . empirically we found that thresholding @xmath79 achieves better results . 
 after we get @xmath80 ( figure [ fig : initialization]f ) , we can reestimate @xmath81 using a simple formula : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a vector replacing all nonzero pixels of @xmath84 with the mean of those nonzero pixels . by running this initialization procedure iteratively 
 , we can extract almost all neurons .      after we get @xmath85 and @xmath86 
 , @xmath87 is mainly the background component and we will approximate it with a matrix described in eq . 
 ( [ eq : bg ] ) . 
 first we use a spline basis with low temporal dynamics to approximate the first term @xmath88 ( baseline + slow trend ) , then we factorize the residual @xmath89 with @xmath39 . by constraining @xmath40 with high spatial smoothness , we can avoid cellular signals being absorbed into the background . 
 we use singular value decomposition ( svd ) together with low - pass filtering of the estimated spatial components to estimate @xmath90 and @xmath91 . 
 ( see supplementary materials [ supp : bg ] for details ) . 
 pca - ica ( @xcite ) is the most widely used automatic methods for analyzing microendoscopic data ( @xcite ) . 
 it seeks spatially and temporally independent components as individual neurons . in this section 
 we compared our cnmf - e with pca - ica method using simulated and experimental data . 
 we simulated @xmath92 neurons activity in the optical field ( @xmath93 pixels ) for @xmath94 frames ( @xmath95 hz ) . to ensure that the background had similar features as real data 
 , we utilized the background extracted from our experimental data as the background in our simulation . 
 we also add i.i.d . 
 gaussian noise to our model ( the simulated video data can be found here ) . 
 after removing all false positives , pca - ica detected @xmath96 neurons and our cnmf - e method found @xmath97 neurons of the @xmath92 neurons . 
 most neurons detected by pca - ica did not have localized structures and multiple neurons were combined together ( see supplementary figure [ fig : supp_ac ] ) . 
 we superimposed the contours of all extracted neurons together on top of the locations of simulated neurons . 
 pca - ica - based segmentation failed to identify a large proportion of the neurons in this dataset , whereas nearly every neuron was identified by the cnmf - e approach ( figure [ fig : sim]cd ) . 
 we matched each simulated neuron with a neuron among all the extracted neurons by selecting the one most correlated with the simulated neuron temporally . 
 for a pair of matched neuron , they should have both high temporal and spatial correlations in the perfect case , i.e. , the real cellular signal is extracted from the data with high fidelity . 
 we displayed spatial and temporal correlations of all simulated neurons with their matched neurons detected by two approaches ( figure [ fig : sim]bd ) . a total number of @xmath97 simulated neurons were accurately recovered by our cnmf - e method ( figure [ fig : sim]d ) . while for pca - ica , a large proportion of the matched neurons have low spatial and temporal correlations ( figure [ fig : sim ] ) indicating failures in recovering real neurons signals . 
 we also display @xmath98 tightly clustered neurons in the simulated data ( figure [ fig : sim]e ) to demonstrate that our cnmf - e approach can accurately detect and demix their activity ( figure [ fig : sim]g ) . 
 the spatiotemporal similarity between the 4 neurons segmented with cnmf - e ( figure 3 g ) and ground truth ( figure 3e ) indicates a good performance in extracting the neural activity . 
 in contrast , pca - ica based detection can only detect two neurons and the calcium traces have high level of noise . 
 the reason is that pca - ica merges multiple neurons together spatially and distorts the calcium traces in the temporal domain . 
 furthermore , the distorted calcium traces reduces the number of detected neurons . 
 the data used here was collected from the prefrontal cortex ( pfc ) of a freely moving mouse . 
 the frame rate is 15 hz . the raw image ( figure [ fig : data_example]a ) is blurry and it is difficult to visually detect any neurons . 
 its local correlation image ( @xcite ) of the raw data is approximately uniform @xmath99 ( figure [ fig : data_example]c ) , which means neighboring pixels share strong background fluctuations . 
 here we removed the background by spatially filtering the raw data with @xmath56 and then calculated local correlation image using eq . 
 ( [ eq : pnr_corr ] ) in supplementary materials . 
 figure [ fig : data_example]d clearly shows the locations of all neurons . 
 appying our proposed cnmf - e method is able to detect @xmath100 neurons from the raw data . 
 their contours are depicted on top the the correlation image and we can see that our method efficiently identifies neurons in the optical field ( figure [ fig : data_example]d ) . 
 after subtracting the extracted background from the raw data , neural activity is visualized more effectively ( figure [ fig : data_example]b ) . 
 the quality of this background correction on the raw data is important for extracting neural signals and demixing neurons . in the supplementary video ( ) 
 , we showed the raw video , extracted background video , background corrected video and reconstructed cellular activity @xmath101 . from the video , we can see that cnmf - e reliably extracted the weak cellular signals from the rapidly fluctuating background . 
 we choose three neighboring neurons within a small field to show the performance of our method . in figure 
 [ fig : data_example]e , we showed their rois and the local correlation image . 
 the mean fluorescence traces within each roi are too noisy to infer any calcium events . 
 both pca - ica and cnmf - e isolated these three neurons and extracted the spiking signals , but the traces extracted with the pca - ica have higher levels of noise . 
 further , note that traces extracted with pca - ica have large artifactual negative peaks . 
 cnmf - e does not have this problem due to the nonnegative requirements . in the shaded region of figure [ fig : data_example]f , 
 we demonstrate potential crosstalk between two neurons , that is avoided by cnmf - e but not pca - ica based segmentation ( watch video here . 
 the temporal traces in the video are extracted from cnmf - e ) .     detected neurons and the correlation image calculated using our cnmf - e method ( see eq . 
 ( [ eq : pnr_corr ] ) in supplementary materials ) . 
 e , mean fluorescence traces from three rois . 
 f , extracted spatial / temporal components of three neurons using pca - ica method . 
 g , results using our cnmf - e method . 
 , width=529 ] 
 in this paper , we proposed an efficient method for extracting cellular signals from microendoscopic data ; such methods are in very high demand in the neuroscience community . 
 the analysis of this video data is the first stage of processing in many experiments , so the quality of source extraction in this step highly influences the scientific conclusions drawn in downstream analysis . as shown in figure [ fig : sim ] and [ fig : data_example ] , 
 our method shows credible performances in recovering the real neuronal signals and outperforms the previous standard pca - ica method . 
 thus the methods introduced here ( which we plan to release as open source software ) will be a powerful and important tool for the neuroscience community .

 since @xmath103 filtering the raw data with @xmath56 results @xmath104(\mathbf{x})\cdot c_i(t).\end{aligned}\ ] ] for each neuron , there is an area @xmath105(\mathbf{x } ) > 0\}$ ] . 
 usually @xmath106 corresponds to the central area for a neuron with gaussian shape . for @xmath107 , @xmath108(\mathbf{x})\cdot c_i(t ) + 
 \sum_{j\neq i}^k [ \tilde{h}\ast a_j](\mathbf{x})\cdot c_j(t ) . 
 \label{eq : zxt}\ ] ] if @xmath109(\mathbf{x})=0 $ ] for all @xmath110 , i.e. , the @xmath111 th neuron is well isolated from the others , then @xmath112 this is a nice feature because we can estimate @xmath102 from @xmath64 directly . 
 empirically we found that this condition can be relaxed to @xmath109(\mathbf{x})\leq0 $ ] . 
 when @xmath109(\mathbf{x})<0 $ ] , @xmath113 has negative spikes from neuron @xmath114 and we can remove them simply by thresholding @xmath64 with its median . 
 thus for each neuron @xmath111 , as long as there exist some @xmath107 and @xmath109(\mathbf{x})\leq0 $ ] for all @xmath110 ( small positive values are still tolerable ) , we can simply approximate its calcium concentration @xmath102 with @xmath64 . 
 a seed pixel @xmath7 should have two main features : first , @xmath113 has high peak - to - noise ratio ( pnr ) because it encodes the calcium concentration @xmath102 of one neuron and usually @xmath102 has large calcium transients ; second , seed pixel has high temporal correlations with its neighboring pixels because they are likely to share the same @xmath102 . 
 we computed two metrics for each of these two features : @xmath115 where @xmath116 ( we use @xmath117 ) determines the range of neighbors and @xmath118 is the total number of neighboring pixels . 
 @xmath119 calculates the temporal correlation between two time series @xmath120 and @xmath121 . 
 the function @xmath122 is a pre - processing of @xmath64 before computing local correlation . in our implementation , we threshold the differencing of @xmath113 by @xmath123 ( e.g. , @xmath124 . 
 this is equivalent to a rough detection of calcium transients . it is better than using @xmath64 directly because it reduces the influence of the background residual , noise and negative spikes from nearby neurons . to avoid unnecessary searches of the seed pixels , we usually set thresholds for both @xmath125 ( e.g. , 5 ) and @xmath126 ( e.g. , 0.5 ) . in each iteration of the initialization 
 , we find the pixel with the maximum value of @xmath127 and set it as a seed pixel . here 
 we use point - wise product of @xmath125 and @xmath126 to emphasize the characteristics of seed pixels . 
 if we successfully initialize one neuron from this seed pixel , the spatiotemporal activity of this initialized neuron @xmath128 will be peeled off from the residual data ( it is @xmath70 at the beginning of the initialization ) . 
 we also have to locally update @xmath125 and @xmath126 in the initialized area . 
 each neuron can only be visited once for initialization . 
 we will stop the initialization procedure until the specified number @xmath19 reaches or there are no more seed pixels . 
 define @xmath130 as nonzero pixels of @xmath84 and @xmath131 then @xmath132 again , the spatial smoothness of the background term @xmath133 induces @xmath134 . when the overlaps between neurons are not severe , @xmath135 , hence , we have @xmath136      the trends of all pixels are independent and we approximate all trends with b - spline basis @xmath137 , i.e. , @xmath138 , where the row vectors of @xmath137 are cubic b - spline basis given a sequences of knots . by increasing the intervals between knots , 
 we lower the number of basis and constrain the dynamics of @xmath139 to be slow . 
 we usually choose evenly distributed knots over the whole time period with an interval of @xmath140 seconds . 
 this is much larger than dynamics of the calcium indicators ( @xmath141 seconds ) . 
 @xmath142 contains coefficients of each spline basis . 
 it is estimated with regression @xmath143\cdot[xx^t]^{-1}$ ] .    after we remove the @xmath38 , we move on to approximate the the fast fluctuations @xmath144 with low rank-@xmath118 matrix @xmath39 . 
 the truncated svd of @xmath145 has the globally minimum frobenious norm of the difference between @xmath145 and @xmath39 . 
 here we choose row vectors of @xmath91 be the top @xmath118 right singular vectors of @xmath145 and then @xmath146 . 
 however , the computed @xmath40 is not guaranteed to have low spatial frequency structure . 
 we post - process @xmath40 to enforce this constraint . here 
 we low - pass filter it with a median filter to get @xmath90 . 
 the size of the median filter is chosen larger than a neuron size . 
 then the background is estimated with @xmath147      empirically after the initialization of @xmath42 and approximating @xmath43 with model ( [ eq : bg ] ) , the results are very close to the optimal solutions . 
 but we can still make the parameter estimations better by iteratively updating model parameters . 
 there are several things we can do : ( 1 ) deconvolve the temporal components in @xmath46 to get denoised calcium traces , ( 2 ) delete false positive neurons , ( 3 ) pick neurons from the residual @xmath148 , and ( 4 ) merge neurons that were inappropriately split into several components . 
 all these operations can lead to better extraction of cellular signals . 
 each time when we update @xmath43 , we run the same procedure as section [ supp : bg ] again 
 . we can adaptively change the b - spline basis and rank of @xmath39 to get better approximation . 
 for example , when we see some trend in cellular signals , we can use spline basis with more knots to explain this trend in the background . 
 sometimes the background corrected data is still blurry because we do not remove the background cleanly . in this case , we can increase the rank to @xmath39 term in background to explain it .    to update @xmath85 and @xmath86 
 , we keep the background @xmath43 unchanged , i.e. , we fit the model @xmath149 . 
 this can be done using the same approaches described in @xcite and we need to make changes by removing the background term ( see section [ sec : updateac ] ) 
 .    our method can also allow users verify the extracted cells visually and delete those low - quality neurons . 
 the spatiotemporal activity of these deleted neurons will be absorbed by the background @xmath43 or other neurons . 
 the signal qualities of nearby neurons might be improved . to add a neuron from the residual @xmath148 , we first select one pixel @xmath65 ( usually the one with the maximum residual ) and then run a rank-1 nmf in a small window centered at @xmath65 to get its spatial and temporal components . we can also manually or automatically select @xmath65 . 
 although these steps are simple , they showed great helps in speeding up the model fitting procedure . as a comparison , 
 pca - ica method has no manual intervention steps . 
 removing false positive neurons could not improve signal extraction of other neurons . 
 after subtracting the background from the raw data , we can optimize @xmath45 and @xmath46 by fitting the model @xmath150 this is the same cnmf problem as proposed by @xcite . 
 the trivial difference is that eq . 
 ( [ eq : new_cnmf ] ) has no background term . 
 we can use the same optimization procedure to estimate @xmath29 . here 
 we rewrite their approaches for this optimization approach . 
 briefly they iteratively update @xmath45 and @xmath46 by solving two optimization problems . 
 ( 1 ) given the estimates of @xmath151 in previously iterations , @xmath152 can be updated by solving the following convex problem @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the standard deviation of the gaussian noise for each pixel @xmath111 . ( 2 ) once we update @xmath155 , we update @xmath156 column by column . to update the @xmath114th column 
 , we first form the quantity @xmath157[\mathbf{c}_1^{(k)},\cdots , \mathbf{c}_{j-1}^{(k ) } , \mathbf{c}_{j+1}^{(k-1)}\cdots , \mathbf{c}_k^{(k-1)}]^t\big),\ ] ] and then apply any deconvolution method of choice to @xmath158 to obtain @xmath159 . 
 we usually use the noise - constrained deconvolution method used in @xcite .    removing the spatial sparsity constraint and the temporal dynamics can 
 significantly reduces the computation time and the results are close to the optimal solution . in this case , 
 ( [ eq : new_cnmf ] ) is a plain nmf problem with some locality constrains . 
 @xcite adapted the hierarchical alternating least squares ( hals ) method ( @xcite ) algorithm to solve it with fast speed . 
 in our implementations , we frequently use the hals algorithm to get convergent results before running the full cnmf approaches . 
 our method is very fast in analyzing data . in the example of the simulated data ( @xmath93 pixels , 3000 frames ) , our naive matlab implementation took @xmath160 minutes to initialize @xmath161 neurons out of @xmath92 on a single desktop . fitting the background model given 
 @xmath42 requires @xmath162 seconds . 
 the manual interventions of adding / deleting neurons only need few clicks and they can be processed in real time . 
 the results of our initialization step are very close the final solutions , so we only need @xmath163 cnmf iterations to update model parameters . 
 the performances of those algorithms used for solving cnmf have been reported in @xcite and @xcite . 
 our implementations can be easily optimized to be faster . in the initialization step , 
 spatial filtering and calculation of the local correlation images are the only computation - intensive parts in the processing of huge data sets . 
 these computations themselves are very classical matrix operations and utilizing gpu can significantly make it faster . since the initialization of each neuron is only dependent on a very small window , the whole initialization step can be easily processed in parallel by segmenting the optical field into multiple small patches . 
 we can also use distributed computing to process the data patch by patch . 
 fitting the background model requires two steps : ( 1 ) the first step is approximating the baseline and slow trends . 
 since all pixels are independent , we can easily run it in parallel without effort ; ( 2 ) the second step is basically svd and there are plenties of existing algorithms or packages to deal with this problem for extremely large datasets . in summary , all the algorithm proposed in this paper has no scalability issues and can be easily scaled for processing any large - scale datasets .","in vivo calcium imaging through microscopes has enabled deep brain imaging of previously inaccessible neuronal populations within the brains of freely moving subjects . 
 however , microendoscopic data suffer from high levels of background fluorescence as well as an increased potential for overlapping neuronal signals . 
 previous methods fail in identifying neurons and demixing their temporal activity because the cellular signals are often submerged in the large fluctuating background . here 
 we develop an efficient method to extract cellular signals with minimal influence from the background . 
 we model the background with two realistic components : ( 1 ) one models the constant baseline and slow trends of each pixel , and ( 2 ) the other models the fast fluctuations from out - of - focus signals and is therefore constrained to have low spatial - frequency structure . 
 this decomposition avoids cellular signals being absorbed into the background term . after subtracting the background approximated with this model , we use constrained nonnegative matrix factorization ( cnmf , @xcite ) to better demix neural signals and get their denoised and deconvolved temporal activity . 
 we validate our method on simulated and experimental data , where it shows fast , reliable , and high quality signal extraction under a wide variety of imaging parameters .","in vivo calcium imaging through microscopes has enabled deep brain imaging of previously inaccessible neuronal populations within the brains of freely moving subjects .
