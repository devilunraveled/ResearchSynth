      "1.Introduction\n",
      "Modern training, entertainment and education applications make extensive use of autonomously\n",
      "controlled virtual agents or physical robots [1]. In these applications, the agents must display\n",
      "complex intelligent behaviors to carry out given tasks. Until recently, those behaviors have always\n",
      "been developed using manually designed scripts, finite state machines (FSMs) or behavior trees\n",
      "(BTs) etc. However, these ways may not only impose intensive work on human designers when\n",
      "facing multiple types of agents, missions or scenarios, but also result in rigid and predictable\n",
      "agent behaviors [2,3]. An alternative way is using machine learning (ML) techniques to generate\n",
      "agent behaviors automatically [1,4,5]. Through providing sample traces or evaluation criterion\n",
      "of experts’ desired behavior, an agent can learn behavior model from expert demonstration or\n",
      "trial-and-error experience respectively. Nevertheless, pure ML approaches, like neuron network (NN)\n",
      "or reinforcement learning (RL), usually generate behavior models as black box systems, which are\n",
      "difficult for domain experts to understand, validate and modify [6,7].\n",
      "Having the advantages of modularity, reactiveness and scalability compared to FSMs, BTs have\n",
      "become a dominant approach to encode embodied agent behavior in computer games, simulation and\n",
      "robotics [8,9]. A BT can be regarded as a hierarchical goal-oriented reactive planner, which can\n",
      "represent not only a static task plan, but also a complex task policy through conditional checks of\n",
      "various situations. Moreover, due to the hierarchical and modular tree structure, BTs are compatible\n",
      "with genetic programming (GP) to perform sub-tree crossover and mutation, which can yield an\n",
      "optimized BT [6]. Furthermore, the well organized behavior model in BT formalism is accessible and\n",
      "easy to fine-tune for domain experts [10,11].\n",
      "To balance between automatic generation and model accessibility, recently, several researchers\n",
      "are focusing on learning transparent behavior models as BTs, particularly using genetic\n",
      "programming [11–14]. GP is an evolutionary optimization approach to search an optimal program for\n",
      "a given problem through learning from experience repeatedly [15,16]. The evolving BT is a series of\n",
      "specific approaches which apply GP for agent behavior modeling in certain tasks. The learned model\n",
      "is represented and acted upon in the form of a BT, which is usually evaluated according to a fitness\n",
      "function defined by domain expert based on mission/task. While those approaches have achieved\n",
      "positive results, there are still some open problems [12,14]. For the standard evolving BTs approach\n",
      "(EBT), the global random crossover and mutation would result in dramatically growing trees with\n",
      "many nonsensical branches, which makes it fail to scale up and to provide good solutions. To efficiently\n",
      "generate a good BT solution, some approaches apply a set of domain-specific constraints to reduce the\n",
      "size of the search space, which may limit the application of evolving BTs approaches [13,17].\n",
      "In this paper, we propose a modified approach, named evolving BTs with hybrid constraints\n",
      "(EBT-HC), to learn behavior models as BTs for autonomous agents. Firstly, a novel idea of dynamic\n",
      "constraint based on frequent sub-trees mining is presented to accelerate learning. It first identifies\n",
      "frequent sub-trees of the superior individuals with higher fitness, then adjusts node crossover\n",
      "probability to protect such preponderant sub-trees from undesired crossover. However, for the\n",
      "large global random search and increasing risk trapped in unwanted local optima, the evolving\n",
      "BTs with only dynamic constraint (EBT-DC) may find unstable solution. Secondly, we extend our\n",
      "dynamic constraint with the existing ‘static’ structural constraint (EBT-SC) [14] to form the evolving\n",
      "BTs with hybrid constraints. The static constraint can set structural guideline for expected BTs to\n",
      "limit the size of search space, thus the hybrid constraints would lead more efficient learning and find\n",
      "better solutions without the loss of the domain-independence. The experiments, carried out on the\n",
      "Pac-Man game environment, show that in most cases the dynamic constraint is effective to help both\n",
      "EBT-DC and EBT-HC to accelerate evolution and find comparable final solutions than the EBT and\n",
      "EBT-SC. However, the solutions found by EBT-DC become more unstable as the diversity of population\n",
      "decreases. The hybrid EBT-HC can outperform other approaches by yielding more stable solutions\n",
      "with higher fitness in fewer generations. Additionally, the resulting BTs and frequent sub-trees found\n",
      "by EBT-HC are comprehensible and easy to analyze and refine.\n",
      "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces background and related\n",
      "works of agent behavior modeling and evolving BTs. Section 3 describes the proposed evolving BTs\n",
      "with hybrid constraints approach. Section 4 tests the proposed approach in the Pac-Man AI game.\n",
      "Finally, Section 5 draws conclusions and suggests directions for future research.\n",
      "2. Background and Related Works\n",
      "In this section, we recall behavior trees and genetic programming as our necessary research\n",
      "background, and review some related works of agent behavior modeling and evolving behavior trees.\n",
      "2.1. Behavior Trees\n",
      "A behavior tree can be regarded as a hierarchical plan representation and decision-making tool\n",
      "to encode autonomous agent behavior. It is an intuitive alternative to FSM with modularity and\n",
      "scalability advantages. Thus, experts can decompose a complex task into simple and reusable low level\n",
      "task modules and build them independently. Nowadays BTs have been adopted dominantly to model\n",
      "the behavior of non-player characters (NPC) (a.k.a. computer generated forces (CGF) in simulation) in\n",
      "game industry, and also applied widespread on robotics [10].\n",
      "A BT is usually defined as a directed rooted tree BT =< V, E, τ >, where V is the set of all the\n",
      "tree nodes, E is the set of edges to connect tree nodes, τ ∈ V is the root node. For each connected node,\n",
      "we define parent as the outgoing node and child as the incoming node. The root has no parents\n",
      "and only one child, and the lea f has no child. A single leaf node represents a primitive behavior.\n",
      "In addition, a node between root and leaves represents a composed behavior combining of primitive\n",
      "behaviors and other composed behaviors, which corresponds to a behavior hierarchy. The execution\n",
      "of a BT proceeds as follows. Periodically, the root node sends a signal called tick to its children. This\n",
      "tick is then passed down to leaf nodes according to the propagation rule of each node type. Once\n",
      "a leaf node receives a tick, a corresponding behavior is executed. The node returns to its parent status\n",
      "Running if its execution has not finished yet, Success if it has achieved its goal, or Failure otherwise.\n",
      "In this paper, we adopt the BTs building approach recommended in [18], whose components\n",
      "include Condition, Selector, Sequence and Action nodes.\n",
      "Condition: The condition node checks whenever a condition is satisfied or not, returning success\n",
      "or f ailure accordingly. The condition node never returns running.\n",
      "Selector: a selector node propagates the tick signal to its children sequentially. If any child returns\n",
      "Success or Running, the Selector stops the propagation and returns the received state. If all children\n",
      "return Failure, the Selector returns Failure.\n",
      "Sequence: a sequence node also propagates the tick signal to its children sequentially. However,\n",
      "if any child returns Failure or Running, the Sequence stops the propagation and returns the received\n",
      "state. Only if all children return Success, the Sequence returns Success.\n",
      "Action: The action node performs a primitive behavior, returning success if the action is completed\n",
      "and f ailure if the action cannot be completed. Otherwise it returns running.\n",
      "Figure 1 shows the graphical representation of all types of nodes used in this paper.\n",
      "Figure 1. The graphical representation of a behavior tree nodes used.\n",
      "2.2. Genetic Programming\n",
      "Genetic programming is a specialization of genetic algorithms which performs a stochastic\n",
      "search to solve a particular task inspired by Darwin’s theories of evolution [15,16]. In GP, each\n",
      "individual within the evolving population represents a computer program, which typically is a tree\n",
      "structure such as a behavior tree. The evolving BTs approach applies GP to optimize a population\n",
      "of randomly-generated BTs for agent behavior modeling. Each BT represents a possible behavior\n",
      "model to control autonomous agent evaluated according to a fitness function defined by domain\n",
      "expert based on task. The learning goal is to find a BT controller which can maximize the fitness in the\n",
      "task. For a BT controller, possible states related to decision-making are encoded as condition nodes,\n",
      "available primitive actions in the task are encoded as action nodes, decision-making logic is controlled\n",
      "by BT composite nodes (such as selector, sequence or parallel), a behavior policy is a tree individual\n",
      "with ordered composition of control nodes and leaf nodes.\n",
      "For BT populations, individuals are evolved using genetic operations of reproduction, crossover,\n",
      "and mutation. In each iteration of the algorithm, some fitter individuals are selected for\n",
      "reproduction directly. Some individuals take crossover operation where a random sub-tree from\n",
      "one individual is swapped with a random sub-tree from another individual and produce two new trees\n",
      "for the next generation. A mutation operator that randomly produces small changes to individuals\n",
      "is also used in order to increase diversity within the population. This process continues until the GP\n",
      "finds a BT that satisfies the goal (e.g., minimize the fitness function and satisfy all constraints).\n",
      "Often, the crossover operation can bring on undesirable effect of rapidly increasing tree sizes for\n",
      "final generated BT. This phenomenon of generating a BT of larger size than necessary can be termed\n",
      "as bloat. Several approaches for dealing with bloat have been developed [16]. These approaches\n",
      "essentially have a fitness cost based on the size of the tree, thus increasing the tendency for more\n",
      "compact tree to be selected for reproduction.\n",
      "2.3. Agent Behavior Modeling and Evolving Behavior Trees\n",
      "In computer games and simulation, a variety of agent programming techniques have been\n",
      "employed to represent and embed agent behaviors, especially for decision-making process.\n",
      "Those techniques usually encode agent behaviors in well-defined structures/models based on domain\n",
      "expertise and customizable constrains, such as FSMs, hierarchical finite state machines (HFSMs),\n",
      "rule-based systems and BTs etc. [2,3]. Among which, BTs have come to the forefront recently for their\n",
      "modularity, scalability, reusability and accessibility [8–10]. However, most of the developments based\n",
      "on those scripting approaches rely on domain expertise and suffer from time-consuming, expensive\n",
      "and difficult endeavor of programming complexity [2,4,19].\n",
      "On the other side of the spectrum, various approaches are emerged in machine learning\n",
      "community to generate adaptive agent behavior automatically [5,20–22]. This field has been\n",
      "studied basically from two perspectives [1,2]: learning from observation (LfO) (a.k.a, learning from\n",
      "demonstration, programming from demonstration) and learning from experience. The former allows\n",
      "agent to extract the behavior model of the target agent by observing the behavior trace of another agent\n",
      "(e.g., using NN and case-based learning) [4,20]. For example, Fernlund et al. [20] adopted LfO to build\n",
      "agents capable of driving a simulated automobile in a city environment. Ontañón et al. [23] use learning\n",
      "from demonstration for realtime strategy games in the context of case-based planning. While the later\n",
      "leads virtual agent to learn and optimize its behavior by interacting with environment repeatedly\n",
      "(e.g., reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms) [5,22]. The performance of the agent is\n",
      "measured according to how well the task is performed as expert’s evaluation criterions, which may\n",
      "sometimes find creative solutions that are not found by humans termed as computational creativity [4].\n",
      "For instance, Aihe and Gonzalez [24], propose Reinforcement learning (RL) to compensate for situations\n",
      "where the domain expert has limited knowledge of the subject being modeled. Teng et al. [22]\n",
      "use a self-organizing neural network to learn incrementally through real-time interactions with the\n",
      "environment, which can improve air combat maneuvering strategies of CGFs. Please note that most\n",
      "of those machine learning methods generate behavior model as a black box system [6,7]. As a result,\n",
      "domain expert could not produce a clear explanation of the relationship between behaviors and models,\n",
      "which is hard to analyze and validate.\n",
      "To remedy the disadvantages, in both behavior learning perspectives, there are some attempts to\n",
      "generate behavior models represented as BTs from observation [7,25] or experience [11,12,14,26,27]\n",
      "automatically. In this paper, we are focusing on generate BTs through experiential learning, especially\n",
      "evolving BTs. Please note that comparing with other policy representation approaches (decision tree\n",
      "etc.), BT is a more flexible representation which allows explicitly a course of actions as a sub-policy\n",
      "for certain situation. Therefore, for evolving BTs, the scalability is still an open problem stemming\n",
      "from the random large space search [12,14]. In [12], the author points out it is too flexible for evolving\n",
      "BTs without structural guidelines, which would result in most trees that are quite inefficient and\n",
      "impossible to read. So the author constrains the crossover with fixed ’behavior block’ sub-trees, which\n",
      "yield comparable reactive behavior. In [14], the authors investigate the effect of ’standard BT design’\n",
      "constraint on evolving BTs approach, which is domain-independent and efficient. They also point\n",
      "out most existing evolving BT approaches adopt different manual constraints to design what the BTs\n",
      "represent and the nature of the tree’s constraints. Some of those approaches can speed up learning\n",
      "efficiently but need a lot of knowledge engineering works, which may limit the application of evolving\n",
      "BT approaches. For instance, Scheper et al. [17] apply genetic algorithm to generate improved BTs\n",
      "for a real-world robotic, the initial creation of the trees are not random but human design. In [13],\n",
      "the whole task in game DEFCON is decomposed into a series of sub-tasks and the learning task is just\n",
      "to evolve simple parameter for each sub-task respectively.\n",
      "Even though the works mentioned above cover most aspects of the behavior modeling with\n",
      "evolving BTs, we intend to use a model-free dynamic constraint to accelerate evolution. We base our\n",
      "work on the standard evolving BTs approach. The main concern is around how to apply model-free\n",
      "constraint or heuristic to speed up BT evolving.\n",
      "3. Methodology\n",
      "In this section, we give details about our proposed approach in mainly tow folds. Firstly,\n",
      "we show an overview of the proposed framework, including its main components and basic workflow.\n",
      "Secondly, we elaborate the proposed dynamic constraint and how we extend it with the existing static\n",
      "structural constraint.\n",
      "3.1. The Proposed Evolving Behavior Trees Framework\n",
      "Our proposed approach, evolving BTs with hybrid constraints (EBT-HC), is outlined in Figure 2.\n",
      "As the figure shows, two new components, ‘Static Structural Constraint’ and ‘Dynamic Constraint’,\n",
      "are added and interacted with the standard evolving BTs process. For the static structural constraint,\n",
      "it set some tree rules to constrain expected BT structure in population initialization and crossover,\n",
      "which can avoid many meaningless and inefficient tree configurations in evolution. For the\n",
      "dynamic constraint, it first applies frequent sub-trees mining for a few higher ranked individuals in\n",
      "each generation, then adjusts nodes crossover probabilities based on the extracted frequent sub-trees,\n",
      "which can protect preponderant structures against undesirable crossover.\n",
      "In detail, the workflow of the proposed EBT-HC for agent behavior modeling can be described\n",
      "as follows:\n",
      "At first, the GP system creates initial BT population individuals under static structural constraint.\n",
      "Unlike fully random combination of leaf nodes and control nodes in standard evolving BTs, the initial\n",
      "BTs are generated constrained by predefined BT syntax rules which will be elaborated in Section 3.3.\n",
      "Secondly, the GP system evaluates each individual in the population respectively, which needs\n",
      "to run the BT simulator and calculate fitness according to the simulation results and behavior\n",
      "evaluation function. The BT simulator simulates the task execution with the agent controlled by the\n",
      "evaluated BT individual, the behavior evaluation function depicts desired behavior effect quantitatively,\n",
      "which will serve as the fitness measure base that determines the appropriateness of the individuals\n",
      "being evolved.\n",
      "Thirdly and foremost, some superior individuals with higher fitness are selected to perform\n",
      "crossover and mutate operations to reproduce offsprings. Here we adopt tournament select,\n",
      "sub-tree crossover and single point mutation. Please note that in the sub-tree crossover, the select of\n",
      "crossover node should be constrained by both static structural constraint and dynamic constraint.\n",
      "Before crossover, we execute a FREQT similar tree mining algorithm for the population and find\n",
      "frequent sub-trees as preponderant structure needing to protect. For each tree individual, according to\n",
      "whether a node belongs to a frequent sub-tree found, we classify nodes in this tree (except the root node)\n",
      "to two sets, protected nodes and unprotected nodes. Then we adjust selected crossover probability of\n",
      "each node accordingly. In brief, we increase the selected probability of unprotected nodes and reduce\n",
      "the selected probability of protected nodes to avoid undesired crossover.\n",
      "After genetic operation, we update the population to next generation to continue evolution until\n",
      "the end condition is reached.\n",
      "3.2. Dynamic Constrain Based on Frequent Sub-Tree Mining\n",
      "In genetic programming, the learner selects preponderant individuals of the current population\n",
      "to reproduce offspring through select operator (e.g., tournament, wheel roulette). From another\n",
      "perspective, the evolution to find an optimal BT is also the process of preponderant structures\n",
      "combination, where a preponderant structure is usually a self-contained behavior sub-tree to deal\n",
      "with certain local situation correctly. So regarding the population individuals as dataset, in each\n",
      "generation, we can mine frequent sub-tree structures of higher fitness individuals. After that we adjust\n",
      "nodes crossover probability to protect such sub-trees against destroyed for faster experiential learning.\n",
      "We call such soft way as dynamic constraint based on frequent sub-tree mining. The intuition behind\n",
      "dynamic constraint is that a frequent sub-tree in superior individuals has a bigger chance to be required\n",
      "by most individuals with higher fitness, even as a sub-tree of the optimal target BT. Thus, we should\n",
      "give more chance to protect such preponderant sub-trees for inherited to next generation. Through\n",
      "preference of crossover nodes based on frequent sub-trees found, in the next generation, there will be\n",
      "more individuals containing those frequent sub-trees, which would lead more precise search around\n",
      "problem space based on those frequent sub-trees, and increase the chance to find a better solution.\n",
      "In detail, there are two steps to apply dynamic constraint in evolution, frequent sub-tree mining\n",
      "and nodes crossover probability adjustment.\n",
      "3.2.1. Frequent Sub-Tree Mining\n",
      "In this section, an adaptation of FREQT [28] is used to mine frequent sub-tree structures\n",
      "in population. FREQT is a classic pattern mining algorithm to discover frequent tree patterns\n",
      "from a collection of labeled ordered trees (LOT). It adopts rightmost expansion technique to\n",
      "construct candidate frequent patterns incrementally. At the same time, frequencies of the candidates\n",
      "are computed by maintaining only the occurrences of the rightmost leaf efficiently. It has been\n",
      "demonstrated that FREQT can scale almost linearly in the total size of maximal tree patterns slightly\n",
      "depending on the size of the longest pattern [28,29].\n",
      "A labeled ordered tree usually represents a semi-structured data structure such as XML.\n",
      "According to the structure and semantics, a behavior tree is a typical labeled ordered tree. Thus the\n",
      "formalism of BT can be expanded from definition of LOT as BTLOT =< V, E, τ, L, \u0016>, where\n",
      "BT =< V, E, τ > is the basic structure of a BT, τ ∈ V is the root node. The mapping L : V → ι\n",
      "is the labeling function, ι includes the labels of root node, control nodes and leaf nodes (condition\n",
      "nodes and action nodes) of a BT. The binary relation \u0016⊆ V × V represents a sibling relation for two\n",
      "nodes in a BT. For two nodes µ and υ of the same parent, iff µ \u0016 υ then µ is an elder brother of υ.\n",
      "The execution of BT is following order of depth first from left to right, \u0016 represents execution orders of\n",
      "two nodes. Thus, we can construct indexes for all the nodes as depth first in an LOT, which can be\n",
      "consistent with records in GP.\n",
      "Let TD = { T1 , T2 , ..., Tn } be the dataset of tree mining, which includes a small fraction of\n",
      "individuals with higher fitness in current population. Tp is a candidate frequent pattern, which is\n",
      "usually a sub-tree in tree mining. δT ( Tp ) is the frequency of Tp in a tree T, d T ( Tp ) depicts whether\n",
      "Tp exists in T. There is d T ( Tp ) = 1 if δT ( Tp ) > 0, else d T ( Tp ) = 0. σ ( Tp ) = ∑ T ∈TD d T ( Tp ) represents\n",
      "the number of trees where frequent pattern sub-tree Tp exists. nt ( Tp ) depicts terminal node size of\n",
      "frequent pattern tree Tp in tree T.\n",
      "To adapt the notions from FREQT to BTs mining in GP system, we modify the rules to judge\n",
      "whether a sub-tree is frequent. According to BT syntax and its design pattern, a tree Tp can be regarded\n",
      "as a frequent pattern iff it satisfies all the following proposed rules.\n",
      "σ( Tp )/| TD | > σmin and NTpmin < | Tp | < NTpmax , where σmin depicts the minimal support of\n",
      "a frequent pattern, NTpmin depicts the minimal node size of a frequent pattern and NTpmax depicts\n",
      "the maximal node size of a frequent pattern.\n",
      "All terminal nodes in a frequent pattern | Tp | must be leaf nodes (condition nodes or action nodes).\n",
      "nt ( Tp ) > NTptmin , where NTptmin depicts the minimal terminal node size of a frequent pattern.\n",
      "Rule 1 is the basic requirement of FREQT data mining algorithms. Rule 2 and rule 3 represent\n",
      "proposed form requirements of expected patterns in behavior modeling with BT. As a decision\n",
      "making tool, the core of a BT is rooted in the logic relation among its leaf nodes. Thus, in rule 2,\n",
      "we believe if a terminal node is a control node, it is meaningless for its located branch. For rule 3, if\n",
      "a frequent pattern has too few terminal nodes (for example only one terminal node), it shows trivial\n",
      "effect on the whole tree construction.\n",

      "To combine dynamic constraint with static structural constraint in evolution, the following two\n",

      "In evolving BTs based on dynamic constraint, we sort all nodes in a tree to either protected nodes\n",
      "set or unprotected nodes set. While in evolving BTs with hybrid constraints, the candidate nodes to be\n",
      "sorted are subset of all the tree nodes. On one hand, in each parent tree, we regard the adjacent terminal\n",
      "child nodes as a sequential block to crossover as Figure 4. So the size of candidate nodes to be sorted is\n",

      "with the same type, so the possible behavior blocks will be unchanged in crossover, which will reduce\n",
      "the population diversity and limit the search for possible solution. Thus, we should set a high mutation\n",

      "nodes in the second selected parent tree, the crossover node must be the same type as the selected\n",
      "node in the first tree to keep the static structural constraint unbroken, here types include sequence,\n",

      "2. Nodes crossover probability is adjusted based on step 1.\n",
      "After modifying the candidate nodes in step 1, the crossover probability of nodes should be\n",
      "adjusted accordingly in Section 3.2.2. It should be noted that iff all nodes in a sequential block are in\n",

      "4. Experimental Section\n",
      "In this section, a series of experiments are carried out in the Pacman AI open-source benchmark\n",
      "to test the performance of our approach in agent behavior modeling. The experiments are run single\n",
      "threaded on an Intel Core i7, 3.40 GHz CPU using the Windows 7 64-bit operating system. Four\n",
      "evolving BTs approaches with different constraints and a handcrafted BT are compared, the training\n",

      "The main goal of our experiments is to demonstrate whether our proposed dynamic constraint\n",

      "4.1. Simulation Environment and Agents\n",
      "Our experiments are tested in the ‘Ms. Pac-Man vs Ghosts’ game competition environment [30],\n",
      "which provides available AI API for the original arcade game Ms. Pac-Man. As Figure 5 shows,\n",
      "this game consists of 5 agents, a single Ms. Pac-Man and 4 Ghost agents. In the game, the player,\n",
      "controlling Pac-Man, must navigate a maze-like level to collect pills and avoid enemy ghosts or else\n",
      "lose a life. After collecting large ‘power’ pills, Pac-Man can consume the ghosts and score additional\n",
      "points in a limited period of time. When all the pills in the level are collected the player moves\n",
      "on to the next level, but if three lives are lost the game is over. The only actions available to the\n",
      "player are movement in a 2-dimensional space along the cardinal directions (up, down, left and right),\n",
      "which makes the action space very small. However, the behavior of an AI agent for this game can be\n",
      "quite complex, making it a suitable candidate for the experiments. The scoring method for the game is\n",
      "as follows: eating a normal pill earns Pac-Man 10 points, eating a power pill earns Pac-Man 50 points,\n",
      "and eating ghosts earn 200 points for the first ghost but doubling each time up to 1600 points for the\n",
      "fourth ghost.\n",
      "To test our evolving BTs approach for agent behavior modeling, we integrate behavior trees and\n",
      "genetic programming into the ‘Ms Pac-Man vs Ghost’ API to model Pac-Man behavior. The ghosts are\n",
      "controlled by the basic script provided in the competition, in which ghosts can communicate to share\n",

      "Fitness Function\n",
      "The fitness function is the sum of averaged game score and a parsimony pressure value as\n",
      "formula f p ( x ) = f ( x ) − cl ( x ) [16]. Where x is the evaluated BT, f p ( x ) is the fitness value, f ( x ) is\n",
      "the averaged game score for a few game runs, c is a constant value known as the parsimony\n",
      "coefficient, l ( x ) is the node size of x. The simple parsimony pressure can adjust the original fitness\n",
      "based on the size of BT, which will increase the tendency for more compact tree to be selected\n",
      "for reproduction.\n",
      "4.2. Experimental Setup\n",
      "In the experiments, four evolving BTs approaches with different constraints are implemented\n",
      "to make comparison. Those are standard evolving BTs, evolving BTs with static constraint, evolving\n",
      "BTs with dynamic constraint, and evolving BTs with hybrid constraints, which are denoted simply as\n",
      "EBT, EBT-SC, EBT-DC and EBT-HC respectively. A handcrafted BT denoted as Hand is also created\n",
      "manually in order to provide a baseline comparison, which is provided by the competition [30].\n",
      "The handcrafted BT follows some simple sequential rules: initially checking if any inedible ghosts\n",
      "were too close and moving away from them before moving to chase nearby edible ghosts. If there are\n",
      "no ghosts within range, Pac-Man would travel to the closest pill.\n",
      "The parameter settings for four evolving BTs approaches are listed as Table 1. Please note that all\n",
      "four approaches use crossover operator to produce two child trees from two parent trees. The main\n",
      "differences are the crossover node select and mutation probability as follows. For the approach EBT,\n",
      "each node, except the root node, has equal chance to be selected as a crossover point. For the approach\n",
      "EBT-SC, the adjacent terminal nodes are regarded as a sequential block, all the control nodes and blocks\n",
      "has equal chance to be selected and swapped. The second crossover node must be the same type as the\n",
      "first selected one. For the approach EBT-DC, each node is selected according to adjusted probability.\n",
      "For the approach EBT-HC, the crossover is similar to the approach EBT-SC, but node select probability\n",
      "is adjusted based on frequent sub-trees found. For the approaches EBT-DC and EBT-HC, the minimal\n",
      "support σmin for frequent sub-trees are set as 0.3, the minimal node size NTpmin of a frequent sub-tree is\n",
      "set as 3, the minimal terminal node size NTptmin is set as 2, the maximal terminal node size NTptmax is set\n",
      "as 15. The discount factor is set as 0.9.\n",
      "To validate the robustness of the proposed approach, a few GA parameters are selected to be\n",
      "variable for the same game scenario. Specifically, we vary three important GA parameters (crossover\n",
      "probability, new chromosomes, and mutation probability) and report 9 results of different combinations\n",
      "for the four evolving approaches. Please note that the sum of crossover probability and reproduction\n",
      "probability is always equal to 1. The number of full variable parameters combination can be very big,\n",
      "thus we adopt following combination strategy. First we set a group of common GA parameters as basis,\n",
      "with crossover proportion 0.9, new chromosomes 0.3, and mutation probability 0.01. Because under\n",
      "static constraint, the adjacent terminal child nodes are regarded as a sequential behavior block and\n",
      "the crossover is constrained only between nodes/blocks with the same type, so the population\n",
      "diversity is reduced greatly. Thus, we set a high mutation probability of 0.1 as basic value for the\n",

      "speed of different approaches under different parameters. Figure 6 shows the learning curves of mean\n",

      "This paper proposed a modified evolving behavior trees approach, named evolving BTs with\n",
      "hybrid constraints (EBT-HC), to facilitate behavior modeling for autonomous agents in simulation\n",
      "and computer games. Our main contribution is a novel idea of dynamic constraint to improve the\n",
      "evolution of Behavior Trees, which discovers the frequent preponderant sub-trees and adjusts nodes\n",
      "crossover probability to accelerate preponderant structure combination. To improve the evolving\n",
      "BT with only dynamic constraint further, we proposed the evolving BTs approach with hybrid\n",
      "constraints by combing the existing static structural constraint with our dynamic constraint. The hybrid\n",
      "EBT-HC can further accelerate behavior learning and find better solutions without the loss of the\n",
      "domain-independence. Preliminary experiments on ’Ms Pac-Man vs Ghosts’ benchmark showed that\n",
      "the proposed EBT-HC approach can produce plausible behaviors than other approaches. The stable\n",
      "final best individual with higher fitness satisfies the goal of generating better behavior policy based\n",
      "on evaluation criteria provided by domain expert. The fast and stable learning curve showed the\n",
      "advantage of hybrid constraints to speed up convergence. From the perspective of tree design and\n",
      "implementation, the generated BTs are human readable and easy to analyze and fine-tune, which can\n",
      "be a promising initial step for transparent behavior modeling automatically.\n",
      "There are some avenues of research to improve this study. Firstly, the proposed approach should\n",
      "be validated in more complex task scenarios and configurations for behavior modeling automatically.\n",
      "In current work, the Pac-Man game is configured as a simple and typical simulation environment\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "to validate proposed approach. However, the interaction between the learning technique and the\n",
      "agent environment is nontrivial. The environmental model, behavior evaluation function, perception,\n",
      "and action sets are critical for behavior performance. Thus, more complex scenarios, such as bigger\n",
      "state-space representation, partial observation or multiple agents in real-time strategy game [31],\n",
      "should be considered to provide rich agent learning environment to validate the proposed approach.\n",
      "On the other hand, it is important to research automatic learning for appropriate parameters setting\n",
      "in GP systems. It is necessary to broaden the applications of proposed approach in more scenarios\n",
      "and configurations.\n",
      "Another interesting research topic is learning behavior trees from observation. For behavior\n",
      "modeling through experiential learning, it is measured by how well the task is performed based on\n",
      "the evaluation criteria provided by experts. However, the optimal behavior may be inappropriate\n",
      "or unnatural. Thus, there are a few works of learning BTs from observation emerged but still an\n",
      "open problem [7,25]. We believe GP is a promising method and the frequent sub-tree mining can\n",
      "be a potential tool to facilitate behavior block building and accelerate learning. The possible issue\n",
      "behind the method is the similarity metric to evaluate the generated behavior. In [32], the authors\n",
      "investigate a gamalyzer-based play trace metric to measure the difference between two play traces in\n",
      "computer games. Based on above techniques, we can develop a model-free framework to generate BT\n",
