1 Introduction
Text summarization aims at generating accurate and concise
summaries from input document(s). In contrast to extractive
summarization which merely copies informative fragments
from the input, abstractive summarization may generate
novel words. A good abstractive summary covers principal
information in the input and is linguistically Ô¨Çuent.
In abstractive summarization, sequence-to-sequence
(Sutskever et al., 2014) has become a dominant framework
using encoder-decoder architectures based on RNNs
(Chung et al., 2014; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)
and more recently Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017).
Most prior work on neural abstractive summarization
relied on large-scale, high-quality datasets of supervised
document-summary pairs (Hermann et al., 2015) and
achieved promising results (Rush et al., 2015; Nallapati
et al., 2016; See et al., 2017). In recent years, there has
been increased interest in collecting new summarization
datasets that have more abstractive summaries (Narayan
et al., 2018), have longer documents, (Cohan et al., 2018;
Sharma et al., 2019), utilize multiple documents (Fabbri
et al., 2019), and are sourced from diverse domains (Grusky
et al., 2018; Koupaee & Wang, 2018; Kim et al., 2019;
Kornilova & Eidelman, 2019; Zhang & Tetreault, 2019);arXiv:1912.08777v3  [cs.CL]  10 Jul 2020PEGASUS: Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization
however, there has been little work on systematic evaluation
of models across these broad settings.
Contemporaneously, the adoption of Transformer models
(Vaswani et al., 2017) pre-trained using self-supervised ob-
jectives on large text corpora (Radford et al., 2018a; Devlin
et al., 2019) have improved performance on many NLP tasks
(Wang et al., 2018; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).
Recent work leveraging such pre-training for Transformer-
based sequence-to-sequence models (Dong et al., 2019;
Song et al., 2019; Rothe et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2019;
Raffel et al., 2019) has extended the success to text genera-
tion, including abstractive summarization.
In this work, we study pre-training objectives speciÔ¨Åcally
for abstractive text summarization and evaluate on 12 down-
stream datasets spanning news (Hermann et al., 2015;
Narayan et al., 2018; Grusky et al., 2018; Rush et al., 2015;
Fabbri et al., 2019), science (Cohan et al., 2018), short
stories (Kim et al., 2019), instructions (Koupaee & Wang,
2018), emails (Zhang & Tetreault, 2019), patents (Sharma
et al., 2019), and legislative bills (Kornilova & Eidelman,
2019). We Ô¨Ånd that masking whole sentences from a docu-
ment and generating these gap-sentences from the rest of the
document works well as a pre-training objective for down-
stream summarization tasks. In particular, choosing puta-
tively important sentences outperforms lead or randomly
selected ones. We hypothesize this objective is suitable for
abstractive summarization as it closely resembles the down-
stream task, encouraging whole-document understanding
and summary-like generation. We call this self-supervised
objective Gap Sentences Generation (GSG). Using GSG
to pre-train a Transformer encoder-decoder on large cor-
pora of documents (Web and news articles) results in our
method, Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Ab-
stractive SUmmarization Sequence-to-sequence models, or
PEGASUS .
With our best 568M parameter model trained on the re-
cently introduced C4 (Raffel et al., 2019) corpus we equal
or exceed state-of-the-art on the 12 summarization tasks
we consider. We further push forward the state-of-the-art
using a newly collected text corpus comprised of news-like
articles we call HugeNews, including the highly competitive
XSum and CNN/DailyMail summarization datasets.
Large-scale document-summary datasets are rare and in
practice there is a mismatch between research datasets and
real-world use-cases where collecting summaries is expen-
sive; the most common setting is that of low-resource sum-
marization. We simulate this setting and show that our
model is able to adapt very quickly when Ô¨Åne-tuning with
small numbers of supervised pairs, obtaining state-of-the-art
results in 6 datasets with only 1000 examples.
Qualitatively we observed high quality outputs from ourbest models and validated this in human evaluation studies.
We found that PEGASUS summaries are at least as good as
reference summaries for the datasets we assessed ‚Äì XSum,
CNN/DailyMail, and Reddit TIFU ‚Äì even at low-levels of
supervision.
To summarize our contributions:
We propose a new self-supervised pre-training objec-
tive for abstractive summarization, gap-sentences gen-
eration, and study strategies for selecting those sen-
tences.
We evaluate the proposed pre-training objective on a
broad range of downstream summarization tasks, with
careful ablations to choose the best model settings,
which we use to train a 568M parameter PEGASUS
model that surpasses or is on-par with the state-of-the-
art on all 12 downstream datasets considered.
We show how good abstractive summarization perfor-
mance can be achieved across broad domains with
very little supervision by Ô¨Åne-tuning the PEGASUS
model and surpassing previous state-of-the-art results
on many tasks with as little as 1000 examples.
We conducted human evaluation studies to validate our
experimental design and demonstrate human-level sum-
marization performance on XSum, CNN/DailyMail,
and Reddit TIFU.
2 Related Work
Dai & Le (2015); Ramachandran et al. (2017) used LM and
autoencoder pre-training on in-domain data to improve per-
formance of RNN sequence models. However, the combina-
tion of pre-training with much larger external text corpora
(such as Wikipedia, books, or Web-pages) and Transformer-
based sequence models has led to a dramatic improvement in
performance when Ô¨Åne-tuned for both natural language un-
derstanding and text generation tasks (Radford et al., 2018a;
Devlin et al., 2019; Rothe et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019;
Joshi et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2019; Lewis
et al., 2019). Most similar to our approach are Transformer
encoder-decoder models pre-trained on some masked input
pre-training objective.
MASS (Song et al., 2019) proposed masked sequence-to-
sequence generation that reconstructs a sentence fragment
given the remaining part of the sentence. A single sentence
fragment was randomly selected.
UniLM (Dong et al., 2019) proposed jointly training on
three types of language modeling tasks: unidirectional (left-
to-right and right-to-left), bidirectional (word-level mask,PEGASUS: Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization
with next sentence prediction), and sequence-to-sequence
(word-level mask) prediction.
T5 (Raffel et al., 2019) generalized the text-to-text frame-
work to a variety of NLP tasks and showed the advantage
of scaling up model size (to 11 billion parameters) and
pre-training corpus, introducing C4, a massive text corpus
derived from Common Crawl, which we also use in some
of our models. T5 was pre-trained with randomly corrupted
text spans of varying mask ratios and sizes of spans.
BART (Lewis et al., 2019) introduced a denoising autoen-
coder to pre-train sequence-to-sequence models. BART
corrupted text with an arbitrary noising function and learned
to reconstruct the original text. For generation tasks, the
noising function was text inÔ¨Ålling which used single mask
tokens to mask random sampled spans of text.
In contrast to MASS, UniLM, BART and T5, the proposed
PEGASUS masks multiple whole sentences rather than
smaller continuous text spans. In our Ô¨Ånal objective we
deterministically choose sentences based on importance,
rather than randomly. As in T5, PEGASUS does not recon-
struct full input sequences, and only generates the masked
sentences as a single output sequence. In this work we focus
entirely on downstream summarization (generative) tasks
and do not evaluate on NLU classiÔ¨Åcation tasks.
There has been some work on the low-resource, summa-
rization setting using the CNN/DailyMail dataset. Radford
et al. (2018b) showed that a large Transformer language
model pre-trained on Web text could generate summaries
if prompted with ‚ÄùTL;DR‚Äù, achieving a ROUGE-2 of 8.27
on CNN/DailyMail. Khandelwal et al. (2019) pre-trained a
Transformer language model on Wikipedia, and Ô¨Åne-tuned
using 3000 examples, achieving 13.1 ROUGE-2.
3 Pre-training Objectives
We propose a new pre-training objective, GSG, in this
work, but for comparison, we also evaluate BERT‚Äôs masked-
language model objective, in isolation and in conjunction
with GSG.
3.1 Gap Sentences Generation (GSG)
We hypothesize that using a pre-training objective that more
closely resembles the downstream task leads to better and
faster Ô¨Åne-tuning performance. Given our intended use for
abstractive summarization, our proposed pre-training objec-
tive involves generating summary-like text from an input
document. In order to leverage massive text corpora for pre-
training, we design a sequence-to-sequence self-supervised
objective in the absence of abstactive summaries. A naive
option would be to pre-train as an extractive summarizer;however, such a procedure would only train a model to copy
sentences, thus not suitable for abstractive summarization.
Inspired by recent success in masking words and contiguous
spans (Joshi et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2019), we select and
mask whole sentences from documents, and concatenate the
gap-sentences into a pseudo-summary. The corresponding
position of each selected gap sentence is replaced by a mask
token [MASK1] to inform the model. Gap sentences ratio ,
orGSR, refers to the number of selected gap sentences to
the total number of sentences in the document, which is
similar to mask rate in other works.
To even more closely approximate a summary, we select
sentences that appear to be important/principal to the doc-
ument. The resulting objective has both the empirically
demonstrated beneÔ¨Åts of masking, and anticipates the form
of the downstream task.
We consider 3 primary strategies for selecting mgap sen-
tences without replacement from a document, D=fxign,
comprised of nsentences:
Random Uniformly select msentences at random.
Lead Select the Ô¨Årst msentences.
Principal Select top-mscored sentences according to im-
portance. As a proxy for importance we compute ROUGE1-
F1 (Lin, 2004) between the sentence and the rest of the
document,si=rouge (xi;Dnfxig);8i.
In this formulation sentences are scored independently ( Ind)
and the top mselected. We also consider selecting them
sequentially ( Seq) as in Nallapati et al. (2017) by greedily
maximizing the ROUGE1-F1 between selected sentences,
S[fxig, and remaining sentences, Dn(S[fxig)as in
Algorithm 1.

5:S:=S[fxkg
6:end for
When calculating ROUGE1-F1, we also consider n-grams
as a set ( Uniq ) instead of double-counting identical n-grams
as in the original implementation ( Orig ). This results in
four variants of the principal sentence selection strategy,
choosing Ind/Seq and Orig/Uniq options.
An example containing lead, random and principal gap sen-
tence selection strategies are shown in Figure 2.PEGASUS: Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization

3.2 Masked Language Model (MLM)
Following BERT, we select 15% tokens in the input text, and
the selected tokens are (1) 80% of time replaced by a mask
token [MASK2] , or (2) 10% of time replaced by a random
token, or (3) 10% of time unchanged. We apply MLM to
train the Transformer encoder as the sole pre-training objec-
tive or along with GSG. When MLM is the sole pre-training
objective, the Transformer decoder shares all parameters
with encoder when Ô¨Åne-tuning on downstream tasks follow-
ing Rothe et al. (2019).
Figure 1 simultaneously shows how both GSG and MLM
are applied to the same example when used in conjunction.
However, we found that MLM does not improve down-
stream tasks at large number of pre-training steps (section
6.1.2), and chose not to include MLM in the Ô¨Ånal model
PEGASUS LARGE (section 6.2).
4 Pre-training Corpus
For pre-training we considered two large text corpora:
C4, or the Colossal and Cleaned version of Common
Crawl, introduced in Raffel et al. (2019); consists of
text from 350M Web-pages (750GB).
HugeNews , a dataset of 1.5B articles (3.8TB) col-
lected from news and news-like websites from 2013-
2019. A whitelist of domains ranging from high-
quality news publishers to lower-quality sites such as
high-school newspapers, and blogs was curated and
used to seed a web-crawler. Heuristics were used to
identify news-like articles, and only the main article
text was extracted as plain text.5 Downstream Tasks/Datasets
For downstream summarization, we only used public ab-
stractive summarization datasets, and access them through
TensorFlow Summarization Datasets1, which provides
publicly reproducible code for dataset processing and
train/validation/test splits. We used train/validation/test ra-
tio of 80/10/10 if no split was provided, and 10% train split
as validation if there was no validation split.
XSum (Narayan et al., 2018) consists of 227k BBC articles
from 2010 to 2017 covering a wide variety of subjects along
with professionally written single-sentence summaries.
CNN/DailyMail (Hermann et al., 2015) dataset contains
93k articles from the CNN, and 220k articles the Daily Mail
newspapers. Both publishers supplement their articles with
bullet point summaries. We use the non-anonymized variant
used in See et al. (2017).
NEWSROOM (Grusky et al., 2018) is a large dataset con-
taining 1.3M article-summary pairs written by authors and
editors in the newsrooms of 38 major publications between
1998 and 2017.
Multi-News (Fabbri et al., 2019) is a multi-document sum-
marization dataset consisting of 56k pairs of news ar-
ticles and their human-written summaries from the site
newser.com.
Gigaword (Rush et al., 2015) contains 4M examples ex-
tracted from news articles (seven publishers) from the Giga-
word corpus (Graff et al., 2003). The task is to generate the
headline from the Ô¨Årst sentence.
arXiv, PubMed (Cohan et al., 2018) are two long document
datasets of scientiÔ¨Åc publications from arXiv.org (113k) and
PubMed (215k). The task is to generate the abstract from
the paper body.
BIGPATENT (Sharma et al., 2019) consists of 1.3 million
U.S. patents along with human summaries under nine patent
classiÔ¨Åcation categories.
WikiHow (Koupaee & Wang, 2018) is a large-scale dataset
of instructions from the online WikiHow.com website. Each
of 200k examples consists of multiple instruction-step para-
graphs along with a summarizing sentence. The task is
to generate the concatenated summary-sentences from the
paragraphs.
Reddit TIFU (Kim et al., 2019) contains 120K posts of
informal stories from the online discussion forum Reddit,
more speciÔ¨Åcally the TIFU sub-reddit from 2013-Jan to
2018-Mar. The sub-reddit posts strictly follow the rule of
writing a descriptive ‚ÄùTL;DR‚Äù summary and has higher qual-

ity than (V ¬®olske et al., 2017) (which used more subreddits)
based on our manual inspection. We uses the TIFU-long
subset (using TLDR as summaries) in the work.
AESLC (Zhang & Tetreault, 2019) consists of 18k email
bodies and their subjects from the Enron corpus (Klimt &
Yang, 2004), a collection of email messages of employees
in the Enron Corporation.
BillSum (Kornilova & Eidelman, 2019) contains 23k US
Congressional bills and human-written reference summaries
from the 103rd-115th (1993-2018) sessions of Congress. We
do not use the California test set which is out-of-distribution.
Following Grusky et al., the number of examples and extrac-
tive fragment coverage/density for all downstream datasets
is illustrated in Appendix A.
6 Experiments
In a similar strategy to Raffel et al. (2019), to save time
and computation we conducted pre-training ablation ex-
periments using a reduced-size model with 223M param-
eters, PEGASUS BASE, smaller batch size, and only 4 of
12 datasets before scaling up pre-training with the best set-
tings to the Ô¨Ånal 568M parameters, PEGASUS LARGE . The
datasets (XSum, CNN/DailyMail, WikiHow and Reddit
TIFU) were chosen for diversity in abstractiveness, writing
style, and size.
PEGASUS BASE hadL= 12;H= 768;F= 3072;A= 12
and PEGASUS LARGE hadL= 16;H = 1024;F=

ers for encoder and decoder (i.e. Transformer blocks),

pre-trained PEGASUS BASE with a batch size of 256and
PEGASUS LARGE with a batch size of 8192 . We refer to
PEGASUS BASE without pre-training as Transformer BASE.
We used sinusoidal positional encoding following Vaswani
et al. (2017). For optimization, both pre-training and Ô¨Åne-
tuning used Adafactor (Shazeer & Stern, 2018) with square
root learning rate decay and dropout rate of 0.1.
We used greedy-decoding for studies in Section 6.1, and
used beam-search with a length-penalty, , as in Wu et al.
(2016) for the Ô¨Ånal large model.
All experiments‚Äô hyper parameters can be found in Ap-
pendix C and reported numbers are in Appendix D and
E.
6.1 Ablations on PEGASUS BASE
We used PEGASUS BASE to evaluate choices of pre-training
corpus, pre-training objective, and vocabulary size. For re-
producibility, we evaluated the latter two using the publiclyavailable C4 corpus.
Note that the y-axis in Figures 3, 4, 5 are normalized by the

bar.
With more pre-training steps, the model observed more doc-
uments in the pre-training corpus. A PEGASUS BASE model
trained for 500k (highest we tried) steps did not observe all
training examples on C4 nor HugeNews. Appendix B shows
the number of pre-training steps had an unsurprisingly posi-
tive impact on downstream dataset performance. We used
500k steps for the ablation studies and the large model.

pre-trained on C4 (350M Web-pages) and HugeNews (1.5B
news-like documents).
Figure 3 shows that pre-training on HugeNews was more
effective than C4 on the two news downstream datasets,
while the non-news informal datasets (WikiHow and Reddit
TIFU) prefer the pre-training on C4. This suggests pre-
training models transfer more effectively to downstream
tasks when their domains are aligned better.
6.1.2 E FFECT OF PRE-TRAINING OBJECTIVES
GSG We compared six variants of GSG (Lead, Random,
Ind-Orig, Ind-Uniq, Seq-Orig, Seq-Uniq) while choosing
30% sentences as gap sentences. As shown in Figure 4a, Ind-
Orig achieved the best performance followed by Seq-Uniq.
Ind-Orig and Seq-Uniq were consistently better (or similar)
than Random and Lead across the four downstream datasets.
Lead had decent performance on the two news datasets but
was signiÔ¨Åcantly worse on the two non-news datasets, which
agrees Ô¨Åndings of lead bias in news datasets (See et al., 2017;
Zhong et al., 2019). The results suggest choosing principal
sentences works best for downstream summarization tasks,
and we chose Ind-Orig for the PEGASUS LARGE .
A signiÔ¨Åcant hyper-parameter in GSG is the gap-sentences
ratio (GSR). A low GSR makes the pre-training less chal-
lenging and computationally efÔ¨Åcient. On the other hand,
choosing gap sentences at a high GSR loses contextual in-PEGASUS: Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization

formation necessary to guide the generation. We compared
GSRs from 15% to 75%. For a fair comparison, the original
documents were truncated to have up to 400 words. The
maximum input length ,Linput in the encoder and the maxi-
mum target length ,Ltarget in the decoder were set as 512
tokens.
Figure 4b shows that different downstream datasets had
slightly different optima. The best performance always had
GSR lower than 50%. The model with 15% gap sentences
achieved the highest ROUGE scores on CNN/DailyMail,
while XSum/Reddit TIFU and WikiHow did better with 30%
and 45% respectively. When scaling up to PEGASUS LARGE
(Section 6.2), we chose an effective GSR of 30%.
MLM As mentioned, the MLM objective can either be ap-
plied solely or together with GSG. We jointly trained MLM
with GSG Ind-Orig (MLM & Ind-Orig), which masks 30%
sentences and extra 15% tokens in unselected sentences, as
shown in Figure 1. Figure 4a shows that the model pre-
trained with MLM alone performed signiÔ¨Åcantly worse and
MLM & Ind-Orig had similar performance as Random. In-
terestingly, when comparing MLM & Ind-Orig to Ind-Orig,
we empirically observed MLM improved Ô¨Åne-tuning per-
formance at early pre-training checkpoints (100k - 200k
steps), but inhibited further gains with more pre-training
steps (500k). Therefore, we chose not to include MLM in
PEGASUS LARGE .
6.1.3 E FFECT OF VOCABULARY
We compared two tokenization methods2: Byte-pair-
encoding algorithm ( BPE ) (Wu et al., 2016; Sennrich et al.,
2016), and SentencePiece Unigram algorithm ( Unigram )
proposed in Kudo (2018). We evaluated Unigram with dif-
ferent vocabulary sizes ranging from 32k to 256k. In these
experiments, models were pre-trained for 500k steps on
the C4 corpus with the Ind-Orig objective and 15% GSR.
As shown in Figure 5, BPE and Unigram were compara-
ble on news datasets while Unigram outperformed BPE

on non-news datasets, especially WikiHow. On XSum
and CNN/DailyMail, Unigram 96k achieved the highest
ROUGE scores. On WikiHow and Reddit TIFU, the best
conÔ¨Ågurations were Unigram 128k and 64k respectively.
Therefore, we used the overall best vocabulary option Uni-
gram 96k in PEGASUS LARGE .
6.2 Larger Model Results
Compared with PEGASUS BASE, the large model
PEGASUS LARGE had increased capacity from larger
hidden size ( H: 768!1024 ,F: 3072!4096 ,
A: 12!16), number of layers ( L: 12!16) and
traversed much more data, due to larger batch size
(B: 256!8192 ) (same number of pre-training steps,
500k). We adopted the best practices found in the
PEGASUS BASE ablation studies using the GSG (Ind-Orig)
pre-training objective without MLM and Unigram vocab-
ulary size of 96k. In total, PEGASUS LARGE had 568M
parameters.
To encourage the model to copy, which is an important as-
pect of the more extractive datasets, we left 20% of selected
sentences unchanged in the input instead of replacing with
[MASK1] . We increased the GSR to 45% to achieve a sim-
ilar number of ‚Äúgaps‚Äù as the optimal 30% found above.
We reported the performance of the models pre-trained
on HugeNews and C4 separately. We conducted a simple
hyper-parameter sweep of learning rate and length penalty,PEGASUS: Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization

, when Ô¨Åne-tuning PEGASUS LARGE on each downstream
dataset.
CNN/DailyMail, Multi-News, arXiv, PubMed, BIG-
PATENT datasets contain input documents longer than
the maximum input length ( Linput = 512 tokens) in pre-
training. This would present a problem for position em-
beddings which would never be updated for longer input
lengths, but we conÔ¨Årm the postulation that sinusoidal po-
sitional encodings (Vaswani et al., 2017) generalize well
when Ô¨Åne-tuning PEGASUS LARGE beyond the input lengths
observed in training up to Linput = 1024 tokens. Since
average input length in BIGPATENT, arXiv, PubMed and
Multi-News are well beyond 1024 tokens, further scaling up
Linput or applying a two-stage approach (Liu et al., 2018)
may improve performance even more, although this is out-
side the scope of this work.
Tables 1 and 2 show the performance improvements
ofPEGASUS BASE and PEGASUS LARGE on downstream
datasets. While PEGASUS BASE exceeded current state-of-
the-art on many datasets, PEGASUS LARGE achieved better
than state-of-the-art results on all downstream datasets usingHugeNews, although C4 performed better on WikiHow.
The improvement from a Transformer model without pre-
training ( Transformer BASE) toPEGASUS LARGE was more
signiÔ¨Åcant on smaller datasets. For example, the ROUGE2-
F1 scores nearly tripled on AESLC and quintupled on Red-
dit TIFU. The large jumps in performance suggest that
small text summarization datasets beneÔ¨Åt the most from
pre-training. We further investigate low resource summa-
rization in Section 6.3.
6.3 Zero and Low-Resource Summarization
In real-world practice, it is often difÔ¨Åcult to collect a large
number of supervised examples to train or Ô¨Åne-tune a sum-
marization model. To simulate the low-resource summariza-
tion setting, we picked the Ô¨Årst 10k(k= 1;2;3;4) training
examples from each dataset to Ô¨Åne-tune PEGASUS LARGE
(HugeNews) . We Ô¨Åne-tuned the models up to 2000 steps
with batch size 256, learning rate 0.0005, and picked
the checkpoint with best validation performance. In Fig-
ure. 6, in 8 out of 12 datasets, with just 100 examplesPEGASUS: Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization

PEGASUS LARGE could be Ô¨Åne-tuned to generate summaries
at comparable quality to Transformer BASE trained on the
full supervised datasets ranging from 20k to 200k examples.
PEGASUS LARGE also beat previous state-of-the-art results
on 6 out of 12 datasets with only 1000 Ô¨Åne-tuning examples.
On CNN/DailyMail, with half the number of parame-
tersPEGASUS LARGE demonstrated much better zero-shot
(ROUGE2-F=13.28) performance than GPT-2 (ROUGE2-
F=8.27). Using only 1000 examples, PEGASUS LARGE
achieved ROUGE2-F of 19.35, much higher than the 13.1
obtained in Khandelwal et al. (2019) with 3000 examples.
6.4 Qualitative Observations and Human Evaluation
Overall, we observed high-linguistic quality (in terms of Ô¨Çu-
ency and coherence), closely emulating the style of ground-
truth summaries. While some previous work suggested that
maximum likelihood training results in repetitive text in
model outputs (Welleck et al., 2019) we found this to be
rare in our outputs and did not require additional counter-
measures to mitigate dis-Ô¨Çuencies.
Although ROUGE clearly has its draw-backs (Kryscinski
et al., 2019), over-penalizing abstractive approaches com-pared to extractive ones and having no sense of linguis-
tic quality, we found that choosing perplexity-optimized
models using aggregated ROUGE (rather than directly op-
timizing ROUGE as in Paulus et al. (2017)) resulted in
qualitatively good models. Randomly sampled (by a pro-
gram) model decodes across all datasets and a broad range
of ROUGE scores can be found in Appendix I.We found
that even low-ROUGE model summaries often were high-
quality, Figure G.1.
To assess how close PEGASUS LARGE is to human perfor-
mance we conducted human evaluation experiments on
Amazon Mechanical Turk comparing model summaries with
(human) reference summaries given the input document.
The examples were drawn from the XSum, CNN/DailyMail,
and Reddit TIFU datasets; the Ô¨Årst two were chosen due to
their popularity in past work, and the third was chosen for
its signiÔ¨Åcant difference in style. Workers were asked to rate
the summaries on a 1-5 scale, with higher being better (full
experiment details provided in Appendix F) and a paired
t-test was used to assess whether scores were signiÔ¨Åcantly
different from human.
In the Ô¨Årst experiment, PEGASUS LARGE (HugeNews),
PEGASUS LARGE (C4), and Transformer BASE were com-
pared with reference summaries; in the second experiment,
PEGASUS LARGE (HugeNews) Ô¨Åne-tuned using 10, 100,
1000, and all supervised examples were compared with
references; the results are shown in Table 3. According to
the signiÔ¨Åcance level of p <0:01, both PEGASUS LARGE
(HugeNews) and PEGASUS LARGE (C4) outputs were at
least as good as the reference summaries in all cases. Even
at low-levels of supervision PEGASUS LARGE (HugeNews)
was not measurably worse than human summaries on XSum
and CNN/DailyMail. In the Reddit TIFU case, however, per-
haps due to its diverse writing styles, human performance
required full supervision.PEGASUS: Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization
6.5 Test-set Overlap with Pre-training Corpus
The pre-training corpora are a large collection of documents
from the Internet and potentially have overlap with the down-
stream test sets. In this section, we measured the extent of
overlap between the pre-training corpus and downstream
datasets. We also studied if the pre-trained model was able
to exploit memorization to achieve higher performance on
the downstream datasets.
To measure the overlap, we calculated similarities between
all pairs of downstream test set targets and pre-training
documents. We use the ROUGE-2 recall as a similarity
measure (common 2-grams / test set targets 2-grams). It is
not necessarily exact match even if the similarity score is 1.0.
We Ô¨Åltered all test set examples that have similarity to any
pre-training example above a threshold, and recalculated the
ROUGE scores on the remaining test set. In Figure 7, we
conducted this study on the pre-training corpus C4 and test
set of XSum, CNN/Dailymail, Reddit TIFU and WikiHow,
with a similarity threshold of 1.0 and 0.8. Results show
that only XSum has signiÔ¨Åcant amount of overlap 15% to
20%, and Ô¨Åltering those examples does not change ROUGE
scores more than 1%. We also manually examined those
overlapped examples with similarity of 1.0, and found that
the models produce very different summaries compared to
the human written ones, suggesting that there was no clear
memorization.

6.6 Additional PEGASUS LARGE Improvements
Following our experiments on PEGASUS LARGE pre-trained
on C4 and HugeNews, we pre-trained a PEGASUS LARGE
model on both corpora and stochastically sampled important
sentences. The PEGASUS LARGE (mixed,stochastic) model
includes the changes: (1) The model was pre-trained on the
mixture of C4 and HugeNews weighted by their number
of examples. (2) The model dynamically chose gap sen-Table 4: Results (ROUGE-1/ROUGE-2/ROUGE-L F

stream datasets.zWe updated the BIGPATENT dataset to
preserve casing, some format cleanings are also changed.

tences ratio uniformly between 15%-45%. (3) Importance
sentences were stochastically sampled with 20% uniform
noise on their scores. (4) The model was pre-trained for
1.5M steps instead of 500k steps, as we observed slower con-
vergence of pre-training perplexity. (5) The SentencePiece
tokenizer was updated to encode the newline character. The
PEGASUS LARGE (mixed, stochastic) model achieved best
results on almost all downstream tasks, as shown in Table 4.
7 Conclusion
In this work, we proposed PEGASUS, a sequence-to-
sequence model with gap-sentences generation as a pre-
training objective tailored for abstractive text summariza-
tion. We studied several gap-sentence selection methods
and identiÔ¨Åed principle sentence selection as the optimal
strategy. We demonstrated the effects of the pre-training
corpora, gap-sentences ratios, vocabulary sizes and scaled
up the best conÔ¨Åguration to achieve state-of-the-art results
on all 12 diverse downstream datasets considered. We also
showed that our model was able to adapt to unseen summa-
rization datasets very quickly, achieving strong results in as
little as 1000 examples. We Ô¨Ånally showed our model sum-
maries achieved human performance on multiple datasets
using human evaluation.

A Datasets Statistics
Following Grusky et al., we calculate extractive fragment coverage/density for all downstream datasets. They were deÔ¨Åned
as
coverage =1
SX
f2F(A;S )jfj
density =1
SX
f2F(A;S )jfj2
whereAis article,Sis summary, and f2F(A;S)are extractive fragments. High density indicates more extractive datasets
and low coverage suggests more novel words in the summary.

F Human Evaluation Details
In all human evaluation experiments we used the same task template shown in Figure F.1, where workers were asked to rate
4 summaries for a document on a scale of 1 (poor summary) to 5 (great summary). The order in which the summaries are
presented for each task was random per example. Each task was independently done by 3 different workers and we retained
the median score across workers for each summary. We paid 1 USD per task and used the following critieria for workers to
ensure high-quality:
Location: US
Minimum approval rate: 95%
Minimum HIITs: 1000
With this criteria we observed high reproducibility in the conclusions of the huamn evaluation. Multiple runs of the same
experiment with different workers meeting this criteria yielded very similar results. The HITT template is provided at
https://github :com/google-research/pegasus .
In experiment 1, the four summaries corresponded to 3 models ( PEGASUS LARGE pre-trained on HugeNews, C4, and
Transformer BASE) that were Ô¨Åne-tuned using all the supervised examples along with the reference (human) summary. We
sampled 100 examples from each dataset (XSum, CNN/DailyMail, Reddit TIFU).
In experiment 2, we evaluated 4 models ( PEGASUS LARGE pre-trained on HugeNews Ô¨Åne-tuned using different amounts of
supervision, 10, 100, 1000, and all examples) alongside the human summary. To do this with the same template, for each
example we randomly selected 4 out of the 5 summaries. This resulted in fewer ratings per model, but did not increase the
work (and cost) of the task.
We used a paired t-test to determine statistical signiÔ¨Åcance when comparing the ratings of two sets of summaries.

H Abstractiveness of Summaries
We compared the abstractiveness of model generated summaries with the human-written ones for all downstream datasets.
We measured abstractiveness of summaries using average values of extractive coverage and extractive density (Grusky
et al., 2018) on each dataset. More abstractive summaries have smaller extractive coverage (more novel words) and smaller
extractive density (smaller spans copied from inputs). Figure H.1 shows that the summaries generated by models were all
less abstractive than the human-written counterparts. However, the models that were Ô¨Ånetuned on more abstractive datasets,
such as XSum and Reddit TIFU, could generate more abstractive summaries than human-written ones on other datasets.

(ID #187)GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors‚Äô magazine Pulse found.
Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said
such incentives were ‚Äùmisguided‚Äù. At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets,
according to Pulse‚Äôs investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than 11,000 to reduce new outpatient
attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer
referrals, were designed to ‚Äùincentivise best quality practice‚Äù and ‚Äùdrive improvements in the quality of primary medical care‚Äù. ‚ÄùOur priority is to
ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,‚Äù said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another

(ID #279)The early work, carried out on mice and pigs, reveals the protein-infused patch encourages the growth of healthy cells and leads to less scarring.
Scarring can be common after a heart attack, making the heart pump less effectively and sometimes fail. Writing in the journal Nature, researchers
say the patch may one day revolutionise treatment. During an attack, muscle cells in the heart die because of a lack of blood Ô¨Çow and scientists
believe repairing or replacing some of these cells may help reduce long-term damage. In this trial an international team of researchers soaked a

naturally in healthy hearts, it becomes depleted in a key layer of the heart after an attack. Two weeks later the hearts began to grow fresh muscle
cells and new blood vessels, while showing signs of pumping more effectively. Prof Pilar Ruiz-Lozano at Stanford University (which has patented
the patch), said: ‚ÄùMany were so sick prior to getting the patch that they would have been candidates for heart transplantation. ‚ÄùThe hope is that
a similar procedure could eventually be used in human heart attack patients who suffer severe heart damage.‚Äù Commenting on the study in Nature,
Prof Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic at Columbia University, said the work ‚Äùcould lead to entirely new modalities for treating heart infarction‚Äù. But she
cautioned that further studies needed to be done to understand whether this type of approach would work on larger animals and ultimately humans.

(ID #177)Around 155 countries are expected to formally sign the deal at the UN, setting in motion events that could see the treaty operational within a year. The
UN says the expected record turnout for the signing shows overwhelming global support for tackling rising temperatures. But some environmentalists
have dismissed the event as a ‚Äùdistraction‚Äù. Despite the absence of President Obama, around 60 world leaders are expected here at UN headquarters,
including French President Francois Hollande and Prime Minister Trudeau from Canada. But their signatures alone will not be enough to make the
Paris agreement operational. The legal requirements mean that each country will have to go through a process of ratiÔ¨Åcation. For some this will
require nothing more than the assent of the political leader as in the example of the United States. Others though, such as India and Japan, will have to
take the document to their parliaments; some may need new laws. The European Union is expected to lag behind on this issue as it has not yet agreed
with the 28 member states on how emissions cuts will be shared out. Each member state will also have to ratify the deal individually. Some countries,
including the Marshall Islands, Palau, Fiji and Switzerland, have already completed this step and will be able to formally join the agreement on April
22. To become operational, the treaty needs at least 55 countries representing at least 55% of global emissions to complete all the steps. While this
is a tough threshold to reach an unusual coalition of interests is making it possible. Firstly President Obama is keen to ensure the deal is operational

(ID #186)There could be ‚Äùserious implications‚Äù for Gloucestershire Police, the police and crime commissioner has warned. Cotswold District Council‚Äôs
proposal to form a unity authority with West Oxfordshire has proved controversial. But CDC says the plans - dubbed ‚ÄôCoxit‚Äô - are at an early
stage but aim to improve accountability. CDC leader Lynden Stowe has said Gloucestershire‚Äôs ‚Äùhistoric borders‚Äù would remain under the proposals,
which aim to improve the ‚Äùadministration and the delivery of council services‚Äù. He told BBC Radio Gloucestershire a few weeks ago: ‚ÄùWe would
expect the police to patrol up to the existing county borders, exactly as now, so if there‚Äôs a crime in Cirencester, Gloucestershire Police attend and
if there‚Äôs a burglary in Burford, Thames Valley Police attend.‚Äù But Gloucestershire‚Äôs PCC Martin Surl said he had taken legal advice on the ‚ÄùCoxit‚Äù
proposal, and warned it could ‚Äùsignal the end of Gloucestershire Police as we know it‚Äù. Under the Local Government and Public Involvement in
Health Act 2007, he said the Cotswolds could become part of Thames Valley Police District. ‚ÄùIf they break away to a new district, we can‚Äôt continue
policing just half a district,‚Äù he told the BBC. ‚ÄùSo, either we start taking some of Thames Valley‚Äôs area in Oxfordshire, or they start policing parts
of Gloucestershire. Neither want that .‚Äù A spokesman for Cotswold District Council said they ‚Äùfully understand the initial concerns‚Äù but they were
‚Äùbest addressed through the detailed studies that will now take place to assess the feasibility of the unitary proposal‚Äù. Mr Surl, an independent, is
standing for re-election as Gloucestershire PCC on 5 May, alongside Labour‚Äôs Barry Kirby and the Conservatives‚Äô Will Windsor Clive.

The Associated Press. The yellow-faced bees population faces a range of threats, like habitat destruction, invasive species both animal and vegetable,
and all manner of natural phenomena such as wildÔ¨Åres, hurricanes, tsunamis and droughts. This news represents an important step for bees in general.
They and many other pollinating species like butterÔ¨Çies are in danger across the world: About 40 percent of invertebrate pollinating species are
facing extinction, according to a U.N. report released in February. This could have devastating effects on global agriculture, as about 75 percent of
the worlds crops rely on pollination to grow. The ruling also grants protection to 39 plant species found in Hawaii and three other native animals:
the band-romped storm-petrel, the orangeblack Hawaiian damselÔ¨Çy and the anchialine pool shrimp. Bees in certain parts of the U.S. are facing a
different threat, as aerial spraying, aimed to combat Zika-spreading mosquitos, is killing hives en masse.

(ID #163)The age when North American clubs look to England and the wider British Isles with a childs embrace, beseeching input from the mother countrys
coaching bosom to take the domestic game on, has long since passed. Or so some critics would argue. A new, forward-thinking generation of
coaches not steeped in the 4-4-2 and an unadorned, direct style of football rule the waves in this epoch, they postulate. And this legion of coaches
are increasingly young, fresh and, most importantly, American. While there might be some historical merit to the spirit of the argument against
the British-style coach, it is perhaps itself a little outdated, not to say somewhat harsh on someone like Carl Robinson and his stylish Vancouver
Whitecaps, for instance. Some 20 years on from the birth of Major League Soccer, some of the men who as players helped mold the countrys top
division into what it has become today now form an integral portion of the younger cohort of the domestic coaching ranks. Broadly successful elder
statesmen like Bruce Arena and Sigi Schmid are followed by a seemingly blossoming rank and Ô¨Åle. Head coaches such as Sporting Kansas Citys

of certiÔ¨Åcation, according to Georgetown University research. But funding for career training has declined drastically. In Massachusetts, the state
budget for programs that provide these services has been slashed in half in the past decade. Soon, however, lower-income residents may have more

twice the risk of cancer across the board,‚Äù he tells Australia‚Äôs ABC. Yes, Nunney‚Äôs study in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B suggests that
taller people are at greater risk for cancer. The surprisingly simple reason? They have more cells, and thus more things go can wrong in those cells,
explains the Guardian. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the study found that cancer risk rises by 10% for every 4 inches people are above average height5 feet 4 for
women and 5 feet 9 for men, reports CNN. The Ô¨Åndings held true for 18 of 23 cancers studied. ‚ÄùNow, you can‚Äôt do anything about your height, but
what you can do is tell extremely tall individuals that they should be aware of this, and if they have any concerns, to get checked,‚Äù says Nunney.
Cancers of the colon and kidney were among those with the strongest correlation to height. A researcher not involved with the study says it backs up
previously seen links between height and cancer
Model Taller people are more likely to develop cancer than shorter people, according to a new study. The study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal

do is tell extremely tall individuals that they should be aware of this, and if they have any concerns, to get checked,‚Äù Nunney says. ‚ÄùIt just suggests
more vigilance, I think.‚Äù One theory is that taller people have more cells in their bodies, which encourages them to grow. But Nunney also found that
cancers in the skin, stomach, and mouth were more closely linked to height. ‚ÄùAcross other cancers, there‚Äôs no real geographical variation,‚Äù he says.

trace amounts of plague DNA, indicating exposure. Early burials found at the site, from the late 1340s, are nice and orderly, with bodies wrapped
in white shrouds, but skeletons from a second outbreak in the 1430s are tossed in with what appear to be upper-body injuriesevidence of ‚Äùa period
of lawlessness and social breakdown,‚Äù Phys.org reports. Among other signiÔ¨Åcant details: Several skeletons suffered from malnutrition and 16% had
rickets. Many had back damage, signalling stressful manual labor. Analysis of one victim is amazingly detailed: He was born outside of London,
breastfed, had bad tooth decay as a boy, and worked in manual labor before dying as a young man of the Black Death. Archaeologists suspect that
thousands more Black Death victims lie nearby, and a dig is planned for this summer. DNA experts are analyzing the plague genome in victims‚Äô
teeth in case there‚Äôs more to learn about the disease, which still kills 2,000 people per year (
Model It‚Äôs a ‚Äùhugely important‚Äù Ô¨Ånd, one that could shed light on the Black Death, the plague that wiped out at least 60% of London‚Äôs population between
1347 and 1351, the BBC reports. Archaeologists digging for railway tracks in London‚Äôs Crossrail station uncovered 25 skeletons, along with pottery
dated to the mid-14th century, that have DNA from the bacterium Yerinia pestis dated to 13 to 50 years old. That‚Äôs a long way from the 660-year-old
record showing that thousands of Londoners died from the plague and their bodies were dumped in a mass grave outside the City of London. ‚ÄùWe can
start to answer questions like: where did they come from and what were their lives about?‚Äù says Crossrail archaeologist Jay Carver. ‚ÄùI‚Äôm amazed of
the reasons for why the Black Death was so devastating.‚Äù DNA from 12 of the skeletons has conÔ¨Årmed that they had contact with the plague prior to
their death, and researchers plan more excavations to see if they‚Äôre coming across a much bigger plague trench. ‚ÄùWe can see that Londoners weren‚Äôt
living an easy life,‚Äù Carver says, ‚Äùand that‚Äôs possibly one of the explanations for why the Black Death was so devastating.‚Äù Antibiotic-resistant strains

(ID #261)A murder suspect remains on the run following a weekend shooting in Montpelier. It left a former Vermont Frost Heaves basketball player dead.
WCAX News is learning the victim and the shooter may have been friends. It appears to have been a night out at the bar gone wrong. Jayveon
Caballero, 29, is wanted for second-degree murder. Nearly 48 hours after he allegedly shot a man to death in Montpelier, police still don‚Äôt know
where he is. ‚ÄùHe may have gotten on a bus yesterday morning in White River Junction, a Greyhound bus, heading south,‚Äù said Maj. Glenn Hall,
Vermont State Police. Police say Caballero fatally shot Markus Austin, 33. A friend told investigators Austin was invited out with friends to join
Caballero, who he called ‚Äùmy boy Jay.‚Äù But at the end of the night a Ô¨Åght broke out. ‚ÄùWe do know from the investigation that there was an altercation
outside Gusto‚Äôs bar in Barre,‚Äù said Hall. The alleged shooter‚Äôs girlfriend, Desiree Cary, 22, told police that she got mad and hit Austin as they left
the bar. Austin allegedly hit her back, injuring her jaw bone. Court documents show Caballero appeared upset and then went to Ô¨Ånd Austin at a
Barre Street apartment. ‚ÄùHe walked over to the victim‚Äôs car and shot him and walked back,‚Äù said Jeff Sarpong, witness. Sarpong says he woke up to
someone yelling outside and a gunshot, and then looked out his window. ‚ÄùI see him turn around, wave with a gun,‚Äù said Sarpong. He said Caballero
appeared to show sympathy just seconds after pulling the trigger. ‚ÄùHe then just kept on asking, ‚ÄôAre you OK?‚Äô‚Äù Sarpong said. ‚ÄùAfter he noticed what
he had done and that he wasn‚Äôt responsive, he just drove away,‚Äù said Sarpong. In an attempt to locate Caballero, police ... ... ...
Gold Police in the country‚Äôs smallest state capital are investigating something that hasn‚Äôt happened there in living memory: a murder. Police in Vermont
say they have issued an arrest warrant for 29-year-old Jayveon Caballero, who is accused of fatally shooting Markus Austin in Montpelier early
Sunday after an altercation, the Times Argus reports. Witnesses told investigators that Austin, 33, assaulted Caballeros girlfriend, Desiree Cary,
during the altercation outside a bar in the nearby city of Barre early Sunday. Police say Caballero later confronted Austin outside his apartment and
shot him dead. The body was found in the parking lot of Austin‚Äôs apartment complex. A Vermont State Police spokesman says Caballero, who knew
Austin before the shooting, Ô¨Çed the town and probably the state after the shooting, WCAX reports. The police spokesman says Caballero is believed
to have boarded a Greyhound bus bound for New York City on Sunday morning, which made numerous stops in other states along the way. Later
Sunday, Cary, 22, was arrested on apparently unrelated charges of selling heroin and crack cocaine. With around 7,500 residents, Montpelier has the
smallest population of any state capital, the AP notes. Police Chief Anthony Facos says this is the city‚Äôs Ô¨Årst murder since a woman shot her husband
in the 1920s.
Model A man has been shot dead outside an apartment complex in what police say is the Ô¨Årst murder in the nation‚Äôs smallest capital city in almost a century.
An arrest warrant was issued for Jayveon Caballero on a murder charge following the Sunday morning shooting in Montpelier, the AP reports. Police
were seeking Caballero in the killing of Markus Austin, whose body was found in the apartment complex‚Äôs parking lot. Caballero is believed to
have boarded a bus on Sunday in White River Junction. Police said the bus was headed to New York City but had several intermediate stops where
he could have gotten off. Police were seeking Caballero in the killing of Austin, whose body was found in the apartment complex‚Äôs parking lot.
Caballero and Austin had been involved in an altercation outside Gustos bar in earlier Sunday morning, police said. During the altercation Austin
assaulted Caballero‚Äôs girlfriend, Desiree Cary, witnesses said. The victim, 33-year-old Markus Austin, was shot outside his apartment at 191 Barre
Street in Montpelier around 4:30am Sunday. Caballero later confronted Austin outside Austin‚Äôs apartment and shot him, police said. Caballero‚Äôs
girlfriend, pleaded not guilty to drug charges and was released. Montpelier has about 7,500 residents, making it the nation‚Äôs least populous capital.

(ID #87)The text on the video above was edited on June 1, 2018 to make it clear that it is impossible to know why the polar bear pictured was starving. An
earlier version of the video went too far in suggesting that climate change was responsible ( read more ). This story was updated on January 19, 2018
to reÔ¨Çect the more speciÔ¨Åc location of where the photographs were taken. When photographer Paul Nicklen and Ô¨Ålmmakers from conservation group
Sea Legacy arrived on Somerset Islandnear the larger BafÔ¨Ån Islandin the Canadian Arctic in late summer, they came across a heartbreaking sight:
a starving polar bear on its deathbed. Nicklen is no stranger to bears. From the time he was a child growing up in Canada‚Äôs far north the biologist
turned wildlife photographer has seen over 3,000 bears in the wild. But the emaciated polar bear, featured in videos Nicklen published to social
media on December 5, was one of the most gut-wrenching sights he‚Äôs ever seen. ‚ÄùWe stood there cryingÔ¨Ålming with tears rolling down our cheeks,‚Äù
he said. Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear‚Äôs back legs drags behind it as
it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit Ô¨Åshers.
It Ô¨Ånds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground. In the days since Nicklen posted the footage, he‚Äôs been asked why he didnt
intervene. ‚ÄùOf course, that crossed my mind,‚Äù said Nicklen. ‚ÄùBut it‚Äôs not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat.‚Äù And
even if he did, said Nicklen, he only would have been prolonging the bear‚Äôs misery. Plus, feeding wild polar bears ... ... ...
Gold An estimated 2.5 billion people saw the image: a starving polar bear struggling across an Arctic landscape. ‚ÄùThe mission was a success, but there
was a problem: We had lost control of the narrative,‚Äù writes Cristina Mittermeier in National Geographic. Accompanied by a photographic team,
she snapped shots of the dying bear last year while colleague Paul Nicklen shot videoall part of their ‚Äùmission to capture images that communicate
the urgency of climate change,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄùWhen Paul posted the video on Instagram, he wrote, ‚ÄôThis is what starvation looks like.‚Äô‚Äù He also
wondered if all 25,000 polar bears would die like this and urged people to reduce their carbon footprint. But he didn‚Äôt say climate change had killed
this bear. That nuance vanished when National Geographic posted the video with the subtitles ‚ÄùThis is what climate change looks like‚Äù and the
Washington Post ran a dramatic headline about ‚Äùgut-wrenching‚Äù images. People also responded dramatically, expressing gratitude for validation of
climate science, anger the crew hadn‚Äôt fed the bear, or a stubborn refusal to acknowledge global warming. ‚ÄùPerhaps we made a mistake in not telling
the full storythat we were looking for a picture that foretold the future and that we didnt know what had happened to this particular polar bear
Model ‚ÄùWe stood there cryingÔ¨Ålming with tears rolling down our cheeks.‚Äù That‚Äôs Paul Nicklen‚Äôs take on a video he posted in December showing a starving
polar bear on an island in the Canadian Arctic, National Geographic reports. The video was shot by Nicklen, a biologist and contributor to National
Geographic, during a trip with the conservation group Sea Legacy. It shows the bear on Somerset Island, near the larger BafÔ¨Ån Island, as it searches
a garbage can for food. At one point, the bear shows signs of starvation. ‚ÄùWhen scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what
it looks like,‚Äù Nicklen tells National Geographic. ‚ÄùBears are going to starve to death. This is what a starving bear looks like.‚Äù The video has since
been viewed more than 3.5 million times, and Nicklen says it struck a nerve. ‚ÄùIf you have any conscience at all, this video of a starving polar bear
will break your heart,‚Äù Newsweek states.

(ID #56)Lip-plumping products come in many forms: glosses, balms, sticks, gels, and pots. Applying these to your lips can temporarily make your lips
look fuller, often by irritating them.The plumping effect will only last for a couple of hours, but you can renew it by reapplying the product to your
lips. Note that the effects wont be as drastic as those achieved through cosmetic surgery.; , Ingredients like cinnamon, ginger mint, wintergreen, and
capsicum will boost blood Ô¨Çow to your lips, causing them to redden and swell i.e., to look fuller., If you wish to combine your lip-plumping product
with a lipstick or gloss, apply the plumper to your lips Ô¨Årst for maximum effectiveness. Dermatologists recommend against overusing lip-plumping
products, as these may cause your lips to become dry and scaly.Try to save the lip plumpers for special occasions. If you want more from your
lip-plumping products, consider trying a treatment plumper. Manufacturers claim that treatment plumpers can stimulate your lips into producing
more collagen and elastin, making your lips fuller for a longer period of time. Treatment plumpers are available for purchase online and in person
at shops that carry beauty products.They may be more expensive than traditional plumpers. Common ingredients in treatment plumpers include
peptides, marine collagen, and human growth factors.

(ID #272)Instead of eating a ton of sugar, which is tempting to do when you‚Äôre tired, try eating complex carbohydrates and protein. Sugar can give you a rush of
energy, but then your energy will crash. Complex carbohydrates, on the other hand, offer more sustained energy, especially when you pair them with
protein.For instance, try some natural peanut butter on whole-wheat bread or a piece of fruit with a slice of cheese. Dehydration can lead to fatigue.
Therefore, staying hydrated will help keep your energy up. Try sipping on water throughout the day to make sure you get enough. The Institute of
Medicine recommends that men drink 13 cups and women drink 9 cups of water every day.Other liquids can contribute to your water intake, such
as juice and coffee. However, drinking too much juice can pack on extra calories and cause a sugar crash, so try to limit your intake. Also, though

(ID #293)so, context. i currently have summer job working in a local amusement park in a small town within northern ireland. one of the requirements for
this job is to operate the ghost train carts as they go in one door and come out the other, while allowing customers on. using a operating desk, with
three buttons on it, i am able to control when cars go in, when the ones in the middle can be moved up and when the ones that have just come out the
bottom (with people in them) can be moved up once the customer has left the cart. so...when the customer comes out the bottom door of the ghost
train, they are about a 20ft gap away from due to the space for the other carts to take up. because of this i try to make them leave their cart asap to
prevent another coming out and crashing into them, and some times i‚Äôll press the button to control that cart just a tad to move it so they get the idea
to move out quickly. one day a woman comes out the bottom of the ghost train....and just sits there. it‚Äôs a busy day, im trying to deal with a lot of
customers, and i have 6 other people breathing down my neck trying to get on. i tell them i need to get this woman off before they can go on. so, i hit
the bottom and shunt her car while she‚Äôs only starting to try and sit up, she looks shocked at me. i do it again, she looks even more shocked. i start
staring at her, implying ‚Äùplease hurry up. you‚Äôre taking your time‚Äù and she slowly moves her way out of the car, grabbing the bars around her and
slowly ... ... ...

(ID #259)yesterday, i tried to cook in a bit of a rush so i could get to work on time. i set the heat to high to heat up my noodles quickly, and in my haste i didnt
notice that some grease had spilled on the eye earlier in the day. i left the noodles to cook, and went to the bathroom. i come back, and the pot is
engulfed in Ô¨Çames. i panicked, moved the pot off of the stove, and put out the Ô¨Åre. after that, i opened up the doors in the house to let it air out so the
Ô¨Åre alarm wouldnt go off. now, i had two of my familys dogs locked up so they wouldnt run out. but, i couldnt Ô¨Ånd the third. i had assumed that he
was in my sisters room, and resumed trying to save the food. well, my sister came downstairs after a few minutes and was looking for her dog. turns
out, the dog had escaped. so, i of course had to stop cooking so i could look for the dog. it took about twenty minutes to Ô¨Ånd him, and i ended up
being late for work and getting chewed out by my manager.

(ID #251)so a little background Ô¨Årst: i‚Äôm on my school‚Äôs student council, and today was our junior prom assembly. we had a lot going on, much of it relying
on a fast internet connection to work (live cameras streamed over appletv, etc.) we realized that as everyone settled into the auditorium, we‚Äôd have a
large portion of the student body connecting to the school wiÔ¨Å, and we were worried about slowdown. our live camera was basically useless without
a good internet connection, so i had the bright idea to hook up the appletv to my personal hotspot. it connected automatically, i ran the feed for a few
seconds, worked like a charm, so we moved on. assembly starts, about 15 minutes in and everything is going great. i‚Äôm backstage when i see our
principal run up to microphone and tell everyone to exit the school immediately, as there is a potential terror threat in the area (i live in an area where
things like this never happen; we‚Äôve had one lockdown in my 10 years of schooling here) obviously, everyone‚Äôs more than a little worried. everyone
Ô¨Åles out, myself included. as i‚Äôm standing outside, a friend walks up and tells us what he found out from a teacher. one of the students, while trying
to connect to the wiÔ¨Å, had ‚Äùdiscovered‚Äù a network... my network: ‚Äùtaliban secure communications.‚Äù needless to say, the student went to a teacher,
things escalated, and the school ordered a full evacuation. i talked to the principal (a very, very awkward conversation) and got everything sorted out.
everyone‚Äôs parents are panicking, checking their kids out of school now. my personal hotspot is now called ‚Äùi love school.‚Äù
Gold turned on personal hotspot with the name ‚Äùtaliban secure communications‚Äù for an assembly, school got evacuated because of a supposed terror threat.

(ID #228)unlike the majority of these, this occurred about 20 minutes ago i am a pc gamer, which means i have a desk with tons of junk on it. sometimes i will
walk in and grab a snack to eat before i start anything, which this time turned out to be a nice bag of chipsticks. i sit down and was so excited to eat
them that i teared open the bag. apparently these have a very low tolerance to force, so as i rip them open the i watch each individual yellow stick
of glory Ô¨Çy everywhere. these not only landed in all the small keyboard gaps but in every little gap imaginable. obviously before i moved i ate each

stuff as well as work in sales (its a private company). i was training him on our systems on his Ô¨Årst day and it got to around noon and a little bit past
so we went out to lunch. chipotle! we‚Äôre talking about stuff getting to know each other. people always tend to ask questions about college, family
blah blah blah. he asks me if i had any siblings, now this question is always tricky. well, my sister died 7 years ago, and i‚Äôm a pretty chill guy so i
don‚Äôt like to bring it up and be the debby downer so i usually do a little white lie. if i have no connection whatsoever back to my real life i say 1, if

a bullet. so i make sure it went off on his topic so i didn‚Äôt have to lie through my teeth. i hate people feeling sorry for me, compassion isn‚Äôt really a
trait that i have (before or after). so fast forward to today when he asks me to go to lunch again today. i try to keep my distance with people who i
just meet just so i don‚Äôt seem like a stage 5 clinger. so i tell him the good place around the area and we go. this is when it gets bad.. he brings back

(ID #128)a few days ago me and my younger cousin (male) were playing with nerf guns shooting eachother around the house. being older and more experienced
with weapons i got him good quite a few times and we were having a great time. his family had bought some knock-off nerf darts that seemed like
a great deal, until they arrived and had solid tips. so instead of feeling like a mild Ô¨Çick these feel like a very strong Ô¨Çick. now so far these darts had
caused no real injuries, just a bit more pain than your average nerf dart. then i foolishly decided to bring out the big guns, namely a pipe i used as a
blowgun that was the perfect diameter for nerf darts. i have used blowguns for a good few years and am pretty good with them in both accuracy and
power, so i knew to regulate my power when shooting at people. it was still more powerful, so in an attempt to draw my Ô¨Åre and catch me ammoless
my cousin held a cowboy hat out from behind a doorway for me to shoot exactly like in a western. so seeing as i‚Äôm shooting an innanimate object i
took a deep breath and lined up my shot. i could see my other even younger cousin (female) in the background watching me but due to my blowgun
experience i assumed she‚Äôd be Ô¨Åne. so i let this breath go and instead of the thump of it hitting the hat my cousin crumples and runs outside crying.

tried to console and reassure her it‚Äôd be Ô¨Åne so ... ... ...

Gold assume a set of objects is given with information about their bilateral relationships , allowing for incomplete and multiple comparisons as well as
different preference intensities . an axiomatic approach is applied for the problem of ranking the objects . consistency requires the preservation
of relative ranking if two sets of such preferences are aggregated . self - consistency assigns the same rank for objects with the same performance
, furthermore , an object should be ranked strictly higher if it shows an obviously better performance than another . it is revealed that these two
properties can not be satisÔ¨Åed simultaneously . the impossibility holds under various restrictions on the domain . however , a positive result emerges
if only the aggregation of ranking problems with the same comparison structure is allowed , for example , we have two round - robin tournaments .
Model consider a set of objects which should be ranked on the basis of information about their bilateral relationships . similar problems arise , among others
, in social choice theory , sports , psychology , internet search , and bibliometrics . we discuss a universal version of the problem involving arbitrary
preference intensities as well as incomplete and multiple comparisons . the main contribution of this paper is the presentation of an impossibility
theorem : consistency requiring that if an object is ranked at least as high as another in two independent problems , then it is ranked as high as
the other in the uniÔ¨Åed problem , too and self - consistency a less known but intuitive property , introduced in xcite , which prohibits to assign a

to classify data points using a maximal margin hyperplane mapped from a linear classiÔ¨Åcation problem to a possibly inÔ¨Ånite dimensional hyperspace

Gold we review the concept of support vector machines ( svms ) and discuss examples of their use . one of the beneÔ¨Åts of svm algorithms , compared
with neural networks and decision trees is that they can be less susceptible to over Ô¨Åtting than those other algorithms are to over training . this issue
is related to the generalisation of a multivariate algorithm ( mva ) ; a problem that has often been overlooked in particle physics . we discuss cross
validation and how this can be used to improve the generalisation of a mva in the context of high energy physics analyses . the examples presented
use the toolkit for multivariate analysis ( tmva ) based on root and describe our improvements to the svm functionality and new tools introduced for
cross validation within this framework .

Gold as the complexity of deep neural networks ( dnns ) trend to grow to absorb the increasing sizes of data , memory and energy consumption has
been receiving more and more attentions for industrial applications , especially on mobile devices . this paper presents a novel structure based on
functional hashing to compress dnns , namely funhashnn . for each entry in a deep net , funhashnn uses multiple low - cost hash functions to fetch
values in the compression space , and then employs a small reconstruction network to recover that entry . the reconstruction network is plugged into
the whole network and trained jointly . funhashnn includes the recently proposed hashednets xcite as a degenerated case , and beneÔ¨Åts from larger
value capacity and less reconstruction loss . we further discuss extensions with dual space hashing and multi - hops . on several benchmark datasets ,
funhashnn demonstrates high compression ratios with little loss on prediction accuracy .

techniques to constrain or reduce the number of free - parameters in dnns during learning . in applications , we observe hashednets compresses model
sizes greatly at marginal loss of accuracy for some situations , whereas also signiÔ¨Åcantly loses accuracy for others . after revisiting its mechanism , we
conjecture this instability comes from at least three factors . Ô¨Årst , hashing and training are disjoint in a two - phase manner , i.e. , once inappropriate

considered a hereditary prostate cancer ( hpc ) family according to the so - called johns hopkins or carter criteria . yet , only a few very rare high
- penetrance gene mutations have been identiÔ¨Åed to cause hpc . in recent years , genome - wide association studies have added approximately 40
low - penetrance genetic polymorphisms that are associated with an increased risk of pca [ 4 , 5 ] . several polymorphisms have also been identiÔ¨Åed

Gold a family history of prostate cancer ( pca ) is an established risk factor for pca . in case of a positive family history , the balance between positive and
adverse effects of prostate - speciÔ¨Åc antigen ( psa ) testing might be different from the general population , for which the european randomized study
of screening for prostate cancer ( erspc ) showed a beneÔ¨Åcial effect on mortality . this , however , went at the cost of considerable overtreatment .
this study assessed dutch physicians knowledge of heredity and pca and their post - erspc attitude towards pca testing , including consideration of
family history . in january 2010 , all dutch urologists and clinical geneticists ( cgs ) and 300 general practitioners ( gps ) were invited by email to
complete an anonymous online survey , which contained questions about hereditary pca and their attitudes towards pca case - Ô¨Ånding and screening .
109 urologists ( 31% ) , 69 gps ( 23% ) and 46 cgs ( 31% ) completed the survey . cgs had the most accurate knowledge of hereditary pca . all but 1
cg mentioned at least one inherited trait with pca , compared to only 25% of urologists and 9% of gps

results of the european randomized study of screening for prostate cancer ( erspc ) and the prostate , lung , colorectal and ovarian cancer screening
trial ( plco ) into clinical practice , the dutch association of urology ( nvu ) and the dutch college of general practitioners ( nhg ) concurrently released

bronchoscope while the other performed pdt . the next 55 procedures were performed by one physician and one nurse , with the physician using the
bronchoscope only to conÔ¨Årm and evaluate the proper depth for the endotracheal tube before performing pdt using the simpliÔ¨Åed method described

Gold when Ô¨Årst introduced , percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy ( pdt ) was performed using a bronchoscope . the bronchoscope itself , however ,
has several disadvantages , including interruption of ventilation . modiÔ¨Åcations of the standard pdt technique have suggested that pdt can be safely
performed without a bronchoscope . however , the safety of these modiÔ¨Åcations is unclear and many modiÔ¨Åcations have yet to be widely adopted
. this study retrospectively evaluated the safety of a simpliÔ¨Åed pdt technique using the cook ciaglia blue rhino in 186 patients . after conÔ¨Årming
the underlying structures by palpation , pdt was performed without a bronchoscope or blunt dissection , 2.0 cm below the cricothyroid membrane
. ultrasonography was used only when palpation was difÔ¨Åcult . except for bleeding in three patients with coagulopathy , none of the patients
experienced any early or late complications , and there were no deaths related to pdt . these Ô¨Åndings conÔ¨Årm that pdt can be safely performed using

. although the use of a Ô¨Åberoptic bronchoscope ( fob ) during pdt has been recommended for precise positioning and to avoid complications ,
bronchoscopy itself can cause complications . this study assessed the safety of a simpliÔ¨Åed pdt technique using the ciaglia blue rhino , by repositioning
the existing endotracheal tube at a pre - determined depth and determining proper pdt site by superÔ¨Åcial palpation.methodsbetween november
2011 and october 2014 , 245 patients in the icu underwent bedside pdt with a ciaglia blue rhino percutaneous tracheostomy set due to prolonged
endotracheal tube insertion . the Ô¨Årst four procedures were performed by two physicians and one nurse using the standard technique , with one
physician operating the bronchoscope while the other performed pdt . the next 55 procedures were performed by one physician and one nurse ,
with the physician using the bronchoscope only to conÔ¨Årm and evaluate the proper depth for the endotracheal tube before performing pdt using the
simpliÔ¨Åed method described below . the remaining 186 procedures were performed using the simpliÔ¨Åed technique after repositioning the endo

(ID #240)stainless steel alloys have remained the material of choice despite the emergence of the more recent titanium , composite and polycarbonate orthodon-
tic brackets . stainless steel alloy contains 8%-12% nickel , 17%-22% chromium and other elements such as copper , iron molybdenum , manganese
, silicon and sulfur[3 - 5 ] in the oral environment , orthodontic brackets are subjected to mechanical and chemical damaging which results in suscep-
tibility to corrosion . corrosion leads to loss of substance from the material , change in its structural characteristics , or loss of structural integrity .
due to the electrolytic capabilities of saliva various types of brackets are commercially available and each demonstrates a unique pattern of corrosion
. in soldered brackets , this corrosion is due to the presence of dissimilar metals ( i.e. the silver solder and the stainless steel ) , a phenomenon termed
galvanic corrosion . metal injection molding ( mim ) brackets are manufactured as a single unit and therefore do not demonstrate galvanic corrosion
. corrosion can have detrimental effects on the surface of stainless steel brackets due to the continuous loss of metal ions . corrosion can increase
the surface roughness of the bracket which leads to elevated friction forces between the bracket and the archwire . this increase in friction results
in unfavorable distribution of forces and reduces the effectiveness of archwire guided orthodontic tooth movement.[7 - 8 ] moreover , by means
of increased stress , the friction would further accelerate the corrosion process . the release of metal ions following the corrosion of brackets has
concerned clinicians and has instigated research in this Ô¨Åeld . among these metal ions , furthermore , direct and prolonged contact of orthodontic
appliances and the resulting corrosion products have been shown to cause local pain and ... ... ...
Gold statement of the problem : stainless steel brackets release metallic ions following the process of corrosion in the oral environment . these released
ions have potential adverse effects on health , friction between wire and bracket , staining , strength of brackets . choosing a bracket with favorable
corrosive properties ; therefore , should be a goal of every practitioner . purpose : the goal of this study is to compare the amount of corrosion among
Ô¨Åve different brands of brackets using inductively coupled plasma ( icp ) mass spectrometry . materials and method : Ô¨Åve different brands of brackets
( dentaurum , 3 m , ortho organizer , cobas and o.r.g ) were chosen and ten brackets were selected from each brand . a piece of stainless steel wire
was ligated to each bracket . the bracket - archwire complex was then immersed in artiÔ¨Åcial saliva . subsequently , the samples were analyzed using
an icp device and the levels of iron , chromium , nickel , and manganese ions were measured . results : the Ô¨Åndings of this study demonstrated that
iron was released the most from the tested brackets , followed by nickel . we also found that the cobas bracket had the most ion release among the
tested brackets ( p ¬° 0.05 )
Model abstractobjectivesthe release of metal ions following the corrosion of brackets has concerned clinicians and has instigated research in this Ô¨Åeld . the
present study aimed to investigate Ô¨Åve different brands of stainless steel brackets and compare their tendency towards corrosion by measuring ion
release in an in - vitro setting.material and methodsten central incisor brackets were selected from each brand . in order to simulate conventional
orthodontic treatment , 8 mm of 0.016 stainless steel archwire was tied in each bracket using 10 mm of 0.25 mm ligature wire ( dentaurum , germany
) . once the brackets were prepared , they were placed in poly - ethylene capped vials containing 10 ml of artiÔ¨Åcial saliva at a ph of 7.2 . the vials
were incubated at 37c for 6 weeks and then they were subjected to thermocycling with 500 temperature cycles from 5c to 55c to simulate the effect
of temperature changes in the oral cavity . the brackets were immersed in each bath for 30 seconds with 2 seconds at air temperature in - between
the immersions . the details of the brackets selected for the study after thermal - cycling the solutions from the vials were analyzed to determine the
amount of nickel , chromium , manganese , and iron using an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer ( icp )

(ID #114)chronic pain affects up to 20% of the population in developed nations.14 this represents a profound impact on individuals and their families alongside
the sizeable burden on employers , health care systems , and society in general.3 when chronic pain occurs , it has the potential to become disease
itself , and subsequently , chronic pain has emerged as a distinct phenomenon.5 management of chronic pain varies greatly between nations and even
within nations . literature supports a multidisciplinary approach as the standard of care , although various health care systems may not always support
this concept consistently.2 the current standard of care for chronic , noncancer pain typically includes many disciplines with the clinician developing
an individualized treatment plan with the options of utilizing surgical interventions , pharmacology , and psychological and physical therapies . opioid
analgesics are often prescribed , despite the lack of clinical evidence supporting their long - term use in the management of chronic pain.6 however ,
for many patients , this multidisciplinary approach is inadequate or ineffectual or is accompanied by the burden of side effects that are unacceptable
and debilitating . only at this late stage , the Ô¨Åeld of neuromodulation for the treatment of pain has developed rapidly since the seminal paper on the
electrical inhibition of pain by the stimulation of the dorsal column almost 50 years ago.7 the original term of dorsal column stimulation has evolved
to become known as spinal cord stimulation ( scs).8 scs has been particularly effective as an adjunct in treating mixed neuropathic / nociceptive and
neuropathic / radicular pain conditions such as failed back surgery syndrome ( fbss ) and complex regional pain syndrome ( crps ) . neuromodulation
therapies offer a treatment option that has minimal side effects and that is relatively safe and ... ... ...
Gold spinal cord stimulation ( scs ) applications and technologies are fast advancing . new scs technologies are being used increasingly in the clinical
environment , but often there is a lag period between the clinical application and the publishing of high - quality evidence on safety and efÔ¨Åcacy .
recent developments will undoubtedly expand the applicability of scs , allowing more effective and individualized treatment for patients , and may
have the potential to salvage patients who have previously failed neuromodulation . already , high - level evidence exists for the safety , efÔ¨Åcacy , and
cost - effectiveness ( level i ii ) of traditional scs therapies in the treatment of chronic refractory low back with predominant limb pain ( regardless
of surgical history ) . more than half of all patients with chronic painful conditions experience sustained and signiÔ¨Åcant levels of pain reduction
following scs treatment . although only limited evidence exists for burst stimulation , there is now level i evidence for both dorsal root ganglion
scs and high - frequency scs that demonstrates compelling results compared with traditional therapies . the body of evidence built on traditional scs
research may be redundant , with newer iterations of scs therapies such as dorsal root ganglion scs , high - frequency scs , and burst scs . a number
