ABSTRACT
In Earth's current climate, moist convective updraft speeds increase with surface warming. This
trend suggests that very vigorous convection might be the norm in extremely hot and humid atmo-
spheres, such as those undergoing a runaway greenhouse transition. However, theoretical and numerical
evidence suggests that convection is actually gentle in water vapor-dominated atmospheres, implying
that convective vigor may peak at some intermediate humidity level. Here, we perform small-domain
convection-resolving simulations of an Earth-like atmosphere over a wide range of surface temperatures
and conrm that there is indeed a peak in convective vigor, which we show occurs near Ts'330 K.
We show that a similar peak in convective vigor exists when the relative abundance of water vapor
is changed by varying the amount of background (non-condensing) gas at xed Ts, which may have
implications for Earth's climate and atmospheric chemistry during the Hadean and Archean. We also
show that Titan-like thermodynamics (i.e., a thick nitrogen atmosphere with condensing methane and
low gravity) produce a peak in convective vigor at Ts'95 K, which is curiously close to the current
surface temperature of Titan. Plotted as functions of the saturation specic humidity at cloud base,
metrics of convective vigor from both Earth-like and Titan-like experiments all peak when cloud-base
air contains roughly 10% of the condensible gas by mass. Our results point to a potentially common
phenomenon in terrestrial atmospheres: that moist convection is most vigorous when the condensible
component is between dilute and non-dilute abundance.
1.INTRODUCTION
Moist convection produces some of the most impactful weather and climate phenomena on Earth, from reective
stratocumulus layers to drenching seasonal monsoons. A longstanding challenge in climate science is to improve the
crude treatment of such convective phenomena in general circulation models, which hampers predictions of critical
quantities such as changes in local precipitation and the sensitivity of Earth's climate to CO 2. Looking beyond Earth,
there is strong evidence that moist convection | that is, convection coupled to phase changes of a condensible substance
| factors into the past and present evolution of the majority of solar system atmospheres, including Venus (Kasting
1988), Mars (Wordsworth 2016; Yamashita et al. 2016), Jupiter (Gierasch et al. 2000), Saturn (Li & Ingersoll 2015),
the ice giants (Hueso et al. 2020), and Titan (Schneider et al. 2012). Therefore, in order improve our understanding
of contemporary Earth climate and planetary climate more generally, there is a clear need to deepen and generalize
our understanding of moist convective physics.
In this paper, we take a step toward a more generalized understanding of moist convection by focusing on one of
its most basic characteristics: convective vigor, or the buoyancy and vertical velocity of cloud updrafts (e.g., Zipser
et al. 2006; Hansen & Back 2015; Hansen et al. 2020). Updraft speeds aect instantaneous surface precipitation
rates (Muller & Takayabu 2020) and the fraction of cloud condensate that is lofted instead of falling to the surface,
which in turn exerts a strong inuence on cloud cover and climate sensitivity (Zhao 2014, 2016). More vigorous
updrafts are more likely to overshoot the tropopause and inject near-surface air into the stratosphere, thereby aecting
stratospheric humidity and chemistry (Liu et al. 2020; O'Neill et al. 2021) and planetary water loss on geologic
timescales (Wordsworth & Pierrehumbert 2013). Lightning, which is closely associated with high updraft speeds
(Deierling & Petersen 2008), further modulates atmospheric chemistry. Focusing on a basic property such as convective
vigor, therefore, may reveal patterns in moist convective behavior with widespread implications.arXiv:2301.03669v1  [astro-ph.EP]  9 Jan 20232
Currently, there are two paradigms for how the vigor of moist convection depends on thermodynamic conditions.
The rst paradigm, which we can call \warming-driven invigoration", states that moist convective vigor increases
with the surface temperature. This paradigm has emerged from numerical modeling of Earth's contemporary tropics:
in idealized cloud-resolving simulations, mean and extreme convective updraft speeds increase with warming (Romps
2011; Muller et al. 2011; Seeley & Romps 2015; Singh & O'Gorman 2015; Abbott et al. 2020). These changes are
consistent with, and typically attributed to, the increases in convective available potential energy (CAPE) that occur in
both global and convection-resolving models (e.g., Del Genio et al. 2007; Sobel & Camargo 2011; Romps 2011; Muller
et al. 2011; Singh & O'Gorman 2013; Seeley & Romps 2015). Although actual updrafts do not attain the velocities
implied by CAPE due to drag and entrainment of unsaturated environmental air, CAPE is nevertheless an extremely
useful proxy for intense convection (e.g., Johns & Doswell 1992; Romps et al. 2014). As shown by Romps (2016), the
increase of CAPE with warming under contemporary conditions is itself attributable to the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling
of near-surface saturation specic humidity. Therefore, the chain of causality in the \warming-driven invigoration"
paradigm is:
increasingTs!increasing humidity !increasing CAPE !increasing convective vigor :
The second paradigm for convective vigor is relevant to atmospheres in which the condensible component is highly
non-dilute, with the limiting case being a pure steam atmosphere. Ding & Pierrehumbert (2016) and Pierrehumbert &
Ding (2016) argued that convection should be gentle in such cases by reasoning that, when the atmosphere is saturated,
the Clausius-Clapeyron curve dictates a one-to-one relationship between pressure and temperature, which precludes
appreciable temperature anomalies between parcels at the same pressure level1. These theoretical predictions gained
support from the work of Tan et al. (2021), who conducted idealized convection-resolving simulations of pure steam
atmospheres with surface temperatures of 600{800 K and found quiescent condensing layers with small temperature
variability and weak updrafts. Hence the line of reasoning in the \gentle pure-steam limit" is:
very high humidity !unique relationship between Tandp!low convective vigor :
Clearly, \warming-driven invigoration", when extrapolated to very warm temperatures, conicts with the \gentle pure-
steam limit". Taken together, these paradigms suggest that convective vigor should reach a peak at some intermediate
humidity level.
In this paper, we seek to generalize our understanding of moist convective vigor by lling the gap between these
two paradigms. Our approach is to simulate a wide range of planetary atmospheres that dier appreciably from
contemporary Earth in terms of their surface temperature, surface pressure, gravitational constant, and composition.
These atmospheres span the parameter space from highly dilute to non-dilute conditions, allowing us to continuously
probe the transitional behavior between the two paradigms for convective vigor. To circumvent the inherent uncertainty
of convective parameterizations and allow detailed analysis of convective dynamics, we performed these simulations
with a exible convection-resolving model (described in detail in section 2). We analyze metrics of convective vigor
in these atmospheres, and show that our results match the predictions of an analytical theory for radiative-convective
equilibrium (RCE) originally developed in the context of Earth's tropics (Romps 2016) (hereafter, R16). The analytical
theory of R16 predicts the mean CAPE of a convecting atmosphere, and we show that this theory provides a unifying
theoretical framework that links the two paradigms for convective vigor.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we describe the exible convection-resolving model and our
numerical experiments. Section 3 analyzes convective vigor in the simulated atmospheres. In section 4, we apply the
theory of R16 to our results. We conclude in section 5 with a discussion of the implications of our work for early Earth
and other planetary atmospheres.
2.EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
2.1. Core experiments
Our core suite of convection-resolving RCE simulations consists of three experiments. The rst core experiment
used the Earth-like model conguration, with the total surface pressure xed at the contemporary value of 105Pa and
the surface temperature varying from 275 K to 365 K (experiment name EarthTemp ). In the second core Earth-like
1This argument neglects \virtual" eects of compositional dierences and condensates on density.3
experiment ( EarthPressure ), the surface temperature was instead xed at 300 K while the surface pressure varied
from (1/16)to 8the contemporary value. The third core experiment ( Titan ) used the Titan-like conguration of
the model with the surface pressure xed at the contemporary value of 1.467 105Pa and the surface temperature
varying from 80 to 110 K. The parameters distinguishing the Earth-like and Titan-like congurations will be described
in detail below; see also Table 1. A number of additional simulations were performed as sensitivity tests, which we
will describe as they come up in the course of the main text.
2.2. Convection-resolving model
For all experiments, we simulated nonrotating radiative-convective equilibrium on square, doubly periodic domains
with the convection-resolving model DAM (Romps 2008). DAM has a nite-volume, fully-compressible dynamical core
and uses the implicit approach to sub-grid diusion. The vertical grid had a variable spacing, transitioning smoothly
from z= 50 m below an altitude of 500 m to  z= 1000 m at altitudes between 10 km and the model top. The
model top was at a variable height because our simulated tropospheres vary widely in geometric depth. The default
horizontal resolution was  x= y= 2 km and the default horizontal domain size was Lx=Ly= 96 km. We also
ran a small subset of simulations at a higher resolution of  x= 500 m and with free-tropospheric  z= 500 m (the
EarthTemp hrexperiment). The default model time step was  t= 20 s, sub-stepped to satisfy a CFL condition;
this time step was used for all simulations but EarthTemp hr, which used  t= 5 s. Overall, the model domains are
similar in size and resolution to the \RCE small" protocol from the RCEMIP project (Wing et al. 2017) in which
DAM participated.
2.3. Radiative transfer
To avoid inessential complexity and focus attention on convective dynamics, we used a simplied treatment of
radiative transfer in the majority of our simulations (as in, e.g., Tan et al. 2021). Specically, we prescribed an
idealized tropospheric radiative cooling using an equation of the form:
 @
@TF=(T Tt); (1)
whereTis the temperature, the temperature derivative @=@T is a vertical derivative, (W/m2/K2) is a constant
setting the magnitude of radiative forcing, F(W/m2) is the net upward radiative ux, and Tt(K) is the prescribed
tropopause temperature. Numerically, we approximated the vertical derivative @=@T with a centered nite dierence
on the model's vertical grid. Equation 1 was proposed by Jeevanjee & Romps (2018) as a t to the invariant radiative
ux divergence curve found for Earth, and has been used as an idealized representation of tropospheric radiative
cooling in more recent work (Jeevanjee & Zhou 2022). We used equation (1) to prescribe radiative forcing for both
Earth-like and Titan-like experiments, although we used dierent values of the parameters (Table 1). At altitudes
above the tropopause, temperatures were simply nudged to Tton a timescale of 6 hours; since our focus is on convective
dynamics in the troposphere, this simplied approach to the stratosphere does not aect our results.
One deciency of equation (1) is that it does not predict the transition to lower-tropospheric radiative heating in very
warm climates, a regime which is known to aect convective dynamics (Seeley & Wordsworth 2021). Therefore, we also
re-ran the EarthTemp experiment with interactive clear-sky radiative transfer (the EarthTemp realrad experiment) to
check that our main results are not sensitive to the simplied treatment of radiation we employ in our core experiments.
We focused on interactive clear-sky radiation because that is sucient to produce the low-level radiative heating regime
of Seeley & Wordsworth (2021), and because DAM is not coupled to a cloud-radiation scheme that is validated up to
the very high temperatures we simulate. Our approach to clear-sky radiative transfer was identical to the line-by-line
method of Seeley & Wordsworth (2021), and we refer the reader to that paper for a complete description.
2.4. Microphysics
The default microphysics scheme in DAM is a bulk scheme with six water classes (vapor, cloud liquid, cloud ice,
rain, snow, and graupel). However, to avoid relying on an overly Earth-centric parameterization, we conducted
our simulations using a simplied microphysics scheme that has been described and used in previous work (Seeley
& Wordsworth 2021). In the simplied microphysics scheme, only three bulk classes of condensible substance are
modeled: vapor, non-precipitating cloud liquid, and rain, with associated mass fractions qv,qc, andqr, respectively.
Microphysical transformations between vapor and cloud condensate are handled by a saturation adjustment routine,4

which prevents relative humidity from exceeding 100% (i.e., abundant cloud condensation nuclei are assumed to be
present) and evaporates cloud condensate in subsaturated air. Conversion of non-precipitating cloud condensate to
rain is modeled as autoconversion according to
a= qc=a; (2)
wherea(s 1) is the sink of cloud condensate from autoconversion and a(s) is an autoconversion timescale. We use
a= 25 minutes, which was found in prior work to produce a similar mean cloud fraction prole as the default bulk
scheme in DAM (Seeley et al. 2020). We did not set an autoconversion threshold for qc. Rain is given a xed freefall
speed with a default value of 8 m/s, but we also checked the sensitivity of our results to this value when appropriate
(the VaryGrav fsexperiment). When rain falls through subsaturated air, it is allowed to evaporate according to
e= (q
v qv)=r; (3)
wheree(s 1) is the rate of rain evaporation, q
vis the saturation specic humidity, and r(s) is a rain-evaporation
timescale. We set r= 50 hours, which was found in prior work to produce a tropospheric relative humidity prole
similar to that of the bulk scheme (Seeley et al. 2020). Since microphysics on Titan is very poorly constrained, we used
the same values for these microphysical constants in both the Earth-like and Titan-like model congurations; future
work could attempt to use rst-principles theories to tune microphysical parameters for the Titan regime (Lorenz 1993;
Loftus & Wordsworth 2021).
2.5. Thermodynamics
The principal dierence between our Earth-like and Titan-like model congurations pertains to the atmospheric
thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of moist air in DAM is based on a standard set of approximations applying
to mixtures of dry air and a condensible component which may be present in vapor, liquid, and solid form. These
approximations are 1) both dry air and the condensible vapor are treated as ideal gases, 2) the heat capacities of all
components are assumed not to depend on temperature, and 3) condensates are assumed to have zero specic volume
(Ambaum 2010; Romps 2008, 2021).
In our convection-resolving experiments, we use a simplied treatment of the condensible component by neglecting
the solid phase, which is not of leading importance for convective dynamics in Earth's tropics (Seeley & Romps 2016).
Therefore, at all temperatures saturation is evaluated via the expression for the saturation vapor pressure over liquid,
which is derived from the above approximations and implemented in DAM as

Le(T) =E0v+RvT+ (cvv cvl)(T Ttrip); (5)5
and where the other physical constants appearing in equations (4{5) are dened in Table 1.
The values assigned to these and other physical constants determine whether DAM simulates Earth-like or Titan-like
atmospheric composition and moist thermodynamics (Table 1). For our Earth-like conguration, dry air is assumed to
be a mixture of 80% N 2and 20% O 2, while the condensible component is water (H 2O). For the Titan-like conguration,
dry air is assumed to be entirely N 2and the condensible component is methane (CH 4).

do not otherwise aect our results.

it is cooler than the adiabatic parcel. (b) Convective available potential energy (CAPE), dened as the vertically-integrated

lifted parcels was subjected to an exponential-decay sink term with a vertical length scale of L= 5 km; see Figure B1 for the
eect of dierent condensate fallout assumptions.
We begin our study of convective vigor with a focus on CAPE. CAPE is the maximum specic vertical kinetic
energy,w2=2 (wherewis vertical velocity), that clouds can attain while rising, so it is a useful summary statistic6
for the potential vigor of convection. Here we calculate CAPE as the vertically-integrated positive buoyancy bof an
adiabatically-lifted parcel between its lifted condensation level (LCL) and its level of neutral buoyancy (LNB):
CAPE =ZLNB
LCLmax(b;0)dz; (8)
where the buoyancy of the parcel is b=g(e=p 1) for parcel density pand environmental density e.
We rst examine CAPE in the EarthTemp experiment, for which the surface temperature was varied in the Earth-like
model conguration. Figure 1a shows, for a subset of surface temperature cases, the environmental temperature prole
(time- and horizontal-mean) compared to the temperature prole of an adiabatically-lifted parcel that is initialized
with the thermodynamic properties of mean near-surface air. There is a clear pattern in these temperature proles:
at low and high surface temperatures, the environment and the adiabat2are nearly indistinguishable, whereas for
intermediate surface temperatures the adiabat is signicantly warmer than the environment, especially in the upper
troposphere. We will describe the physical explanation for this behavior in section 4. Since CAPE measures the
integrated buoyancy of an adiabatic parcel, CAPE is therefore small at both low and high surface temperatures, with
a peak in between (Fig. 1b). While the quantitative magnitude and location of this peak in CAPE are somewhat
sensitive to assumptions about condensate fallout in the lifted adiabatic parcel (Fig. B1), the existence of a peak is
robust to these details.

The growth and decline of CAPE with warming in the EarthTemp experiment appears to connect the previously
mentioned \warming-driven invigoration" and \gentle pure-steam limit" regimes. The near-surface specic humidity
in these simulations ranges from about 0.2% in the coldest simulation to about 60% in the warmest, conrming that
water vapor transitions from being a very minor trace gas to a dominant component. However, CAPE only measures
thepotential vigor of convection. How do actual convective updraft speeds vary in these simulations? Figure 2a
shows two metrics of actual convective vigor from the EarthTemp experiment. The rst of these metrics, wmean
max,
is calculated by conditionally sampling all grid cells with w > 1 m/s and cloud condensate qc>10 5kg/kg. The
horizontal-mean vertical velocity of these cloudy-updraft grid cells is calculated at each tropospheric vertical grid level,
and the maximum value of this prole is what we refer to as wmean
max (labeled \updraft-mean" in Fig. 2b). The second
metric of convective vigor is calculated from the histogram of vertical velocities at each tropospheric vertical grid
2For brevity, we will refer to the temperature prole of a lifted, undiluted near-surface parcel as an \adiabat", ignoring the small eect of
buoyancy on the parcel's lapse rate (e.g., Riehl & Malkus 1958; Romps 2015). Note that the \adiabats" plotted in Figure 1 are intermediate
between the pseudo-adiabatic process (all condensates removed) and the reversible process (all condensates retained). Specically, the
condensate sink term from fallout is modeled as@qc
@zjfall= qc=L7
level; these histograms are not conditionally sampled based on cloud condensate. We calculate the 99.9th percentile
of each tropospheric grid level's vertical velocity histogram, and the maximum value of this vertical prole is what
we refer to as w99:9
max(labeled \99.9th percentile" in Fig. 2b). Similar to CAPE, these metrics also show an initial
growth and eventual decline with increasing surface temperature, with the warmest simulation actually having slower
wmaxvalues than the coldest. Note that although the qualitative behavior of wmaxis similar to CAPE, the peaks in
thewmaxmetrics occur at a lower surface temperature than the CAPE peak, and wmaxis right-skewed while CAPE
is left-skewed. Other choices of summary statistics for convective vigor lead to peaks at slightly dierent surface
temperatures, but the overall phenomenon is robust to these choices. The peak in convective vigor is also robust to
increased horizontal and vertical resolution (the EarthTemp hrexperiment; Fig. 2a, open circles) and use of realistic
clear-sky radiation (the EarthTemp realrad experiment; Fig. 2a, open squares).

humidity increases toward the right.
How general is this peak in convective vigor with respect to atmospheric humidity? In the EarthTemp experiment,
the increase in q
vis driven by the increasing surface temperature and associated Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of the
saturation vapor pressure. However, specic humidity can also be increased, at xed temperature, by lowering the
amount of non-condensing background gas (Wordsworth & Pierrehumbert 2013). Would varying the surface pressure,
therefore, also produce variations in CAPE and convective vigor? To test this, we turn to the EarthPressure experiment,
in which we xed the surface temperature at 300 K but varied the surface pressure from 8 105Pa to 6250 Pa
(between a factor of 8 and 1/16the contemporary value). Figure 3 shows that CAPE varies in EarthPressure in
qualitatively the same manner as in EarthTemp , reaching a peak at an intermediate surface pressure (around 2 104
Pa, approximately 20% of the contemporary value). Likewise, Figure 2b shows that actual convective vigor in the
EarthPressure experiment also peaks at intermediate surface pressures, although there is again an oset between the
peak CAPE and the peak in actual convective vigor. Since Earth's surface pressure is relatively unconstrained during
the Hadean and Archean (Kavanagh & Goldblatt 2015; Som et al. 2016), these results may have implications for the
early evolution of Earth's climate and atmospheric chemistry; we will return to this topic in section 5.
If the boom-bust evolution of CAPE seen in the EarthTemp and EarthPressure experiments is attributable to
the transition from condensible-poor (dilute) to condensible-rich (non-dilute) conditions, this recipe is not specic to
Earth-like moist convection: in any atmosphere with a suciently large surface reservoir of a condensible species, the
condensible will become increasingly volatile with warming and eventually come to dominate atmospheric composition.
To what other planetary atmospheres, then, might this boom-bust CAPE behavior apply? A natural candidate is8

Saturn's moon Titan, which is often regarded as the closest current hydrological analog to Earth due to its active
methane precipitation cycle. Therefore, to further generalize our understanding of convective vigor, we next turn to
theTitan experiment. This experiment assumes Titan-like thermodynamic conditions and atmospheric composition
(i.e., a thick N 2atmosphere with condensing CH 4and low gravity; Table 1). Similar to the Earth-like experiments,
Figure 4 shows a peak in CAPE as the simulated Titan-like atmospheres transition from dilute to non-dilute methane
abundance. Figure 2c shows that metrics of actual convective vigor in this experiment peak at a surface temperature
of about 95 K. Intriguingly, this is very close to the current surface temperature of Titan.
To better compare our three core experiments, it is helpful to recast the results in terms of variations in atmospheric
humidity rather than surface temperature or pressure. Figure 5 plots CAPE and high-percentile updraft speeds from
the core experiments as a function of the specic humidity at the lifted condensation level, q
v;LCL . This reveals
that CAPE and convective vigor in all three experiments peaks when cloud base air contains roughly 10% of the
condensible component by mass, give or take a factor of about 2. Therefore, we can conclude that the \warming-
driven invigoration" regime comes to an end at intermediate humidity, well before these atmospheres approach the
steam limit.
4.THE PHYSICAL ORIGIN OF THE CAPE PEAK
Taken all together, our three core experiments point to a potentially common phenomenon in terrestrial atmospheres:
moist convection is most vigorous at intermediate atmospheric humidity. What is the physical explanation for this
behavior? In this section, we show that recent advances in the theory of convection provide a quantitative explanation
for the peak in CAPE with respect to atmospheric humidity.
The basic ingredient required to understand climatological variations in CAPE is a theory for the tropospheric lapse
rate, which we denote by  ( z) = @T=@z (K/km). Note that the standard assumption in idealized 1-dimensional
radiative-convective modeling, which is that  ( z) is given by the moist adiabat, is useless for the purpose of predicting
CAPE: the CAPE of a moist-adiabatic atmosphere is zero by denition. It is the systematic deviations from a
moist-adiabatic thermal structure that a successful theory for CAPE must predict.
The key theoretical breakthrough in this regard was made by Singh & O'Gorman (2013) (hereafter, SO13), who
emphasized the role of entrainment. Entrainment refers to the turbulent mixing with environmental air that cloudy
updrafts experience as they ascend. Because entrainment of subsaturated air reduces condensation and latent heating
in ascending parcels, entraining parcels cool more rapidly with height than otherwise identical undiluted parcels. The
insight of SO13 is that the troposphere can be approximated as being neutrally buoyant with respect to such entraining9

convective parcels, rather than with respect to an undiluted parcel; this assumption has come to be known as the
\zero-buoyancy" (ZB) approximation3. Dening   mas the lapse rate of an undiluted parcel and   eas the lapse rate
of an entraining parcel (which, by the ZB approximation, is equal to  ), we can state that   m<  =   e. According
to this picture, then, entrainment is the wedge that drives   mand   apart, allowing for potentially large reservoirs of
CAPE even in steady-state RCE.
To make this discussion quantitative, we turn to the simplest model of a convecting atmosphere that incorporates
entrainment: the \bulk-plume model"4. The bulk-plume model divides the atmosphere into two plumes: ascending,
saturated (cloudy) air, and descending, subsaturated environmental air; the \bulk" descriptor refers to the fact that
the thermodynamic properties of these two plumes are assumed to be homogeneous in the horizontal at each altitude.
Mass exchange between the two plumes is represented by specied entrainment and detrainment rates, such that
conservation of mass in the bulk-plume model is expressed as
@M
@z=e d
=M(" ); (9)
whereM(kg/m2/s) is the upward convective mass ux (equal and opposite, in RCE, to the subsidence mass ux in
the environmental plume), eandd(kg/m3/s) are the mass entrainment and detrainment rates, and "and(m 1)
are known as the fractional entrainment and detrainment rates, dened as e=M andd=M, respectively. Equation (9)
implies that the convective mass ux increases with height if entrainment outpaces detrainment, and vice versa.
The second bulk-plume equation we will use is the conservation equation for moist static energy h, which is conven-
tionally dened as h=cpT+gz+Lqv. Herecp(J/kg/K) is the specic heat capacity of air at constant pressure, L
(J/kg) is the latent heat of evaporation, and the other symbols take their usual meaning. While this is an approxi-
mate expression for moist static energy | neglecting, for instance, the temperature-dependence of the latent heat of
evaporation (Romps 2015) | it is suciently accurate to form the basis of a theory for CAPE. The conservation of
moist static energy in the entraining convective plume is expressed as
@(Mh)
@z=ehe dh; (10)
3We stress that this zero-buoyancy assumption is not a zero-CAPE assumption: it is the entraining convective parcels that are assumed to
have zero buoyancy with respect to the mean environment, not the adiabatic parcel that is used to calculate CAPE.
4This discussion of the zero-buoyancy bulk-plume theory for CAPE is based on that in Romps (2016) and Romps (2020); we refer the reader
to these references for a more thorough treatment.10

saturated). The environmental moist static energy can be expressed as he=cpT+gz+LRq
v, where we have used the
sameTas in the convective plume (invoking the ZB approximation) and where the environmental specic humidity
is given by the product of R, the environmental relative humidity, and the saturation specic humidity, q
v.
Using the product rule on the left-hand side of equation (10), substituting in equation (9), and using the denitions

Equation 11 states that the entraining plume's moist static energy decreases with height at a rate proportional to the
saturation decit of the environment, (1  R)q
v(Seeley & Romps 2015).
Although SO13 treated the environmental relative humidity, R, as an external parameter that must be specied,
analysis of the bulk-plume water budget can yield a self-consistent analytic expression for R(Romps 2014):
R=+ "

In equation 12, is a nondimensional parameter specifying the fraction of condensates formed at a given height that
evaporate at that height instead of precipitating out of the atmosphere (i.e., the precipitation eciency of the bulk-
plume convection is 1  ). The quantity is the water vapor lapse rate, dened as  @lnq

whereRvandR(J/kg/K) are the specic gas constants for water vapor and dry air, respectively. The expression
(13) is straightforward to derive by combining the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for the saturation vapor pressure with
hydrostatic balance (Romps 2014).
The nal step toward the theory for CAPE was taken by Romps (2016). For analytic solubility, that work considered
a simplied case and assumed that M,R, andare all constant with height. The constancy of Mimplies"=, by
equation (9), while the constancy of Randimply that the relative humidity and entrainment rate can be expressed
in terms of another constant, a0, as follows:

Note thata, which we will refer to as the \bulk-plume parameter", is proportional to the entrainment rate, so that
a= 0 corresponds to undiluted convection. Plugging in equations (14{15) to the right-hand side of equation (11)
yields

Equation (18) is a generalization of the moist lapse rate that accounts for the eect of entrainment (Romps 2020).
In the limit of no entrainment ( a!0), equation 18 reduces to the standard expression for the moist adiabat,   m:

We can use equation (18) to analyse the dierence between   and   m| and, therefore, CAPE | in the limit of very
dry and very moist atmospheres. In the dry limit ( q
v!0), which is approached by reducing the surface temperature
or increasing the amount of background dry air, we can drop all terms multiplied by q
vinside the brackets in equation
(18), which allows the factors of (1 + a) in the numerator and denominator to cancel and yields   m=g=cp=  d, the
dry-adiabatic lapse rate. Hence entrainment has no eect on the lapse rate in the dry limit,   and   mare both equal
to the dry adiabat, and CAPE is zero. On the other hand, in the very moist limit ( q
v!1), which is approached
by increasing the surface temperature or decreasing the amount of background dry air, the terms multiplied by q
v
dominate over the factors of afor typical Earth and Titan-like conditions. For example, for Earth-like conditions5,
the factorL=(RT) ranges from about 25{50, while the factor L2=(cpRvT2) ranges from about 100{500, in both cases
dominating over a, which typically takes on values of O(0:1) O(1) (Romps 2016). Hence the entraining lapse rate
asymptotes to  'gT=L | which, as in the dry limit, is independent of the entrainment rate, and also equal to the
moist limit of   m. To summarize, equation (18) suggests that we should expect minimal CAPE in both the dry and
moist limits, with a peak in between for the intermediate values of q
vthat allow entrainment to drive a wedge between
  and   m.

Figure 6. CAPE from the (a) EarthTemp , (b) EarthPressure , and (c) Titan experiments from the convection-resolving
simulations (colored markers) and from the analytical predictions for CAPE given by equation (A1) (gray shaded areas). The
analytical predictions are shown for values of the bulk-plume parameter aranging from 0.2 to 0.8 for the Earth-like experiments,
and foraranging from 0.5 to 1.5 for the Titan-like experiment. The analytical solutions are initialized with the temperature
and humidity of the lifted condensation level from the corresponding simulation.
Quantitatively, the magnitude and atmospheric humidity of the peak in CAPE can be predicted using the analytic
formalism of Romps (2016). Figure 6 shows analytical predictions for CAPE using the theory of R16 (reproduced in our
equation A1), in comparison to the results from our convection-resolving simulations. The theory clearly captures the
boom-bust evolution of CAPE in all three core experiments, providing the theoretical bridge between the \warming-
driven invigoration" and the \gentle pure-steam limit" regimes. While R16 applied their analytic theory for CAPE
to the context of surface warming on Earth, here we have shown that the same essential physics explains convective
vigor in convection-resolving simulations with varied surface temperature, varied surface pressure, and with Titan-like
thermodynamics. The notion that entraining and adiabatic temperature proles converge in non-dilute atmospheres
resembles the arguments given by Ding & Pierrehumbert (2016) and Pierrehumbert & Ding (2016), although our
results suggest that this physics begins to operate well before the steam limit is reached. Ding & Pierrehumbert
(2016) and Pierrehumbert & Ding (2016) also argued that environmental relative humidity should approach 1 as the
atmosphere becomes increasingly non-dilute, a prediction that is conrmed by our results (Fig. B2).
In addition to explaining the behavior of CAPE in our convection-resolving simulations, the theory of R16 provides
clarity on which planetary parameters control CAPE. An interesting attribute of equation A1 is that it has no explicit
dependence on a planet's gravitational constant, g. Physically, this can be understood as a cancellation between two
5We leave investigation of whether this limit holds in more exotic circumstances, such as exoplanet silicate atmospheres with temperatures
in the thousands of kelvins (e.g., Kang et al. 2021), to future work.12
factors: 1) for a given parcel temperature anomaly, there is a direct proportionality between the parcel's buoyancy and
g; and 2) for a given surface temperature and tropopause temperature, there is an inverse proportionality between
the geometric depth of the atmosphere and g; hence reducing gravity lowers the integrand in equation 8 but increases
the domain of vertical integration by a compensating amount.
To test this prediction of an insensitivity to g, we ran a subset of surface temperature cases from the EarthTemp
experiment with either enhanced ( g= 25 m/s2) or reduced ( g= 3:5 m/s2) gravitational constant (the VaryGrav
experiment); these values of gapproximately cover surface conditions for solar system planets ranging in mass from
Mercury to Jupiter. We nd a weak dependence of CAPE on g(i.e., CAPE varies by a factor of '2 whengvaries by a
factor of'7), in rough accordance with the theoretical prediction, and also nd a correspondingly small sensitivity in
our metrics of actual convective vigor to g. The small variations in CAPE and convective vigor likely result from the
eect ofgon the nature of turbulence in the simulations, which would aect both the entrainment rate that enters into
the theory for CAPE (through the bulk-plume parameter a) and the drag experienced by actual convecting parcels.
These experiments with varied gravity also aord an opportunity to test the sensitivity of our results to the precipi-
tation fall speed parameter, which some studies have suggested is a key control on updraft speeds (Parodi & Emanuel
2009). Assuming a conservative6linear dependence of precipitation fall speed on g, we re-ran the cases with g= 3:5
m/s2andg= 25 m/s2with the precipitation fall speeds modied to 2.8 m/s and 20 m/s, respectively. We found this
had a minimal eect, with changes in CAPE and convective vigor generally limited to 5%.
5.DISCUSSION
Using an idealized convection-resolving model, we have demonstrated that convective vigor is expected to peak at
intermediate concentrations of the condensing substance in a diversity of planetary circumstances. However, more work
is needed to build our results into a universal understanding of convective vigor. Our simulations of local radiative-
convective equilibrium are highly idealized, and many questions remain about how the peak in convective vigor with
respect to atmospheric humidity would manifest in more realistic modeling setups that include coupling to large-scale
circulations (Pierrehumbert & Ding 2016) or a diurnal cycle. Another promising avenue for extension concerns our
Titan-like simulations, for which we assumed a limitless supply of surface evaporation. In reality, the surface of Titan is
quite arid (Schneider et al. 2012), and future work could explore convective vigor in the regime where the atmospheric
condensible inventory is comparable to the total inventory.
Additionally, although we have successfully applied the theory of R16 to our results, that theory is limited in its
general applicability because it approximates the specic gas constant and heat capacity of moist air by those of the dry
component. This is a tolerable source of error when the dry and condensing components do not dier too much in molar
mass, as in the case of H 2O condensing in an N 2/O2mixture or CH 4condensing in N 2, but this approximation breaks
down when the background gas is very light (e.g., mainly H 2). In that case, the atmospheric scale height can collapse
with warming as the atmosphere comes to be dominated by the relatively heavier condensing component (Koll & Cronin
2019). Since many planets form with a primordial hydrogen envelope, this is an important class of atmospheres to
which the R16 theory and our simulation results may not apply. Additional theoretical and computational work could
investigate this regime, for which the \virtual" eects of compositional dierences on buoyancy may be crucial.
In additional to building fundamental understanding of moist convection, our results may also have implications for
planetary evolution on long time scales. The rate at which a terrestrial planet loses water depends on stratospheric
humidity, because water transported to the stratosphere becomes vulnerable to photolysis and subsequent loss of
H to space (Kasting 1988). Purely thermodynamic arguments suggest that stratospheric moistening in planetary
atmospheres depends on both surface temperature and surface pressure, with the transition to a moist stratosphere
occurring at intermediate humidities (Wordsworth & Pierrehumbert 2013). However, on present-day Earth, injection
of water into the stratosphere by intense convective storms plays an important role in setting the average stratospheric
water content (Corti et al. 2008). It may be that in real atmospheres, the increase in convective vigor at intermediate
humidity causes the \moist greenhouse" transition (Kasting 1988) to be approached more rapidly than either one-
dimensional radiative-convective models or 3D general circulation model simulations (e.g., Leconte et al. 2013) would
suggest. Further research using models that couple convection to large-scale dynamical and radiative processes is
required to investigate this possibility.
6Theoretical results for monodisperse droplets predict a square-root dependence of raindrop terminal velocity on g(Loftus & Wordsworth
2021).13
Furthermore, because the rate of lightning strikes in planetary atmospheres is believed to depend in part on convective
vigor, these results may also have important implications for lightning-driven atmospheric chemistry. Romps et al.
(2014) proposed that the lightning ash rate on modern Earth is proportional to the product of CAPE and precipitation
rate. If this relation is robust across wide ranges of planetary conditions, it implies that the importance of lightning
chemistry would be strongly enhanced in atmospheres with intermediate specic humidity. Because both surface
temperature and atmospheric pressure may have varied signicantly on Earth in the Hadean, this has interesting
implications for the rate of lightning-driven formation of important prebiotic molecules such as HCN during this
period (Chameides & Walker 1981; Ardaseva et al. 2017).

Here,R(J/kg/K) is the specic gas constant of dry (background) air, Rv(J/kg/K) is the specic gas constant of

heat capacity at constant pressure of dry air, q
vs(kg/kg) is the saturation specic humidity at the surface, and T0
(K) is a constant reference temperature chosen to be the average of the surface temperature Tsand the tropopause

by equation A3 with a= 0.
The expression for CAPE given above depends only on known physical constants, observable planetary conditions,
and a summary parameter characterizing the bulk-plume convection. The bulk-plume parameter ais proportional to
the entrainment rate7, and it is easy to verify that setting a= 0 (the limit of non-entraining convection) produces a
moist-adiabatic atmosphere with zero CAPE, as expected. We can also verify that equation A1 makes quantitatively
accurate predictions for Earth's tropics today. We set a= 0:2, which corresponds to typical values of precipitation
eciency and entrainment rate as diagnosed in cloud-resolving simulations, as discussed in R16. Additionally using
Ts= 300 K,q
vs= 20 g/kg, L= 2:5106J/kg, andTt= 200 K, equation A1 predicts CAPE '2500 J/kg, which is
