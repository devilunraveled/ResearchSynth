ABSTRACT
In Earth's current climate, moist convective updraft speeds increase with surface warming. This
trend suggests that very vigorous convection might be the norm in extremely hot and humid atmo-
spheres, such as those undergoing a runaway greenhouse transition. However, theoretical and numerical
evidence suggests that convection is actually gentle in water vapor-dominated atmospheres, implying
that convective vigor may peak at some intermediate humidity level. Here, we perform small-domain
convection-resolving simulations of an Earth-like atmosphere over a wide range of surface temperatures
and conrm that there is indeed a peak in convective vigor, which we show occurs near Ts'330 K.
We show that a similar peak in convective vigor exists when the relative abundance of water vapor
is changed by varying the amount of background (non-condensing) gas at xed Ts, which may have
implications for Earth's climate and atmospheric chemistry during the Hadean and Archean. We also
show that Titan-like thermodynamics (i.e., a thick nitrogen atmosphere with condensing methane and
low gravity) produce a peak in convective vigor at Ts'95 K, which is curiously close to the current
surface temperature of Titan. Plotted as functions of the saturation specic humidity at cloud base,
metrics of convective vigor from both Earth-like and Titan-like experiments all peak when cloud-base
air contains roughly 10% of the condensible gas by mass. Our results point to a potentially common
phenomenon in terrestrial atmospheres: that moist convection is most vigorous when the condensible
component is between dilute and non-dilute abundance.
