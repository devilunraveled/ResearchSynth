Outperforming 5 LDPCs with GRAND over long,
low rate codes - making a long story short

Abstract —We establish that a large and ﬂexible class of long,
high redundancy error correcting codes can be efﬁciently an d
accurately decoded with guessing random additive noise dec od-
ing (GRAND). Performance evaluation demonstrates that it i s
possible to construct simple concatenated codes that outpe rform
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes in the 5G New Radio
standard. The concatenated structure enables many desirab le
features, including: low-complexity hardware-friendly e ncoding
and decoding; high levels of ﬂexibility in length and rate th rough
modularity; and high levels of parallelism in decoding that enable
low latency.
Central to this is the development of a method through which
any soft-input GRAND algorithm can provide soft-output in t he
form of an accurate a posteriori estimate of the likelihood t hat a
decoding is correct or, in the case of list decoding, the like lihood
that each element of the list is correct. The key distinguish ing
feature of the soft-output in comparison to other methods is
the provision of an estimate that the correct decoding has no t
been found, even when providing a single decoding. That per-
block soft-output can be converted into accurate per-bit so ft-
output by a weighted sum that includes a term for the soft-
input. Crucially, implementing the method for generating s oft-
output adds negligible additional computation and memory t o
the existing decoding process, and using it results in a prac tical
alternative to LDPC codes.
